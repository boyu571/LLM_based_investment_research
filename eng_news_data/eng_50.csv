This is the largest bout of liquidations since the crash on March 12th, which sent Bitcoin from $7,700 to $3,700 within the span of 24 hours. This indicates that longs were overleveraged, presumably because they were anticipating more upside after the rally to $10,000 seen earlier this week. Skew.com First-hand reports from Twitter suggest that during this move, Coinbase actually temporarily went down. Though, the site seems to have come back online, at least for this writer.

Not as I’d imagined and not as fun, that’s for sure. In the next few hours, you’ll see 1-6k charts again. But eh. Think this is bottom or slightly lower.” The cryptocurrency also held both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, suggesting bulls remain somewhat in control of Bitcoin.

Trade activity has accelerated in 2020, with the firm reporting over $1.5 billion in notional volume for the first quarter. The company has operated for six years in total.CoinShares rebrands $3 bln trading shopTo complement the exchange-traded products already provided by CoinShares, CSCM now offers a suite of trading tools and services, including electronic trading, liquidity provisioning, and lending and borrowing products.The platform also offers “bespoke hedging and risk management solutions for miners, exchanges, brokers, crypto funds, and other specialized firms.”In addition to the firm, CoinShares has acquired CSCM’s portfolio of products and services, “including proprietary trading technology and trading systems.”CoinShares’ new leadership drive ‘strategic realignment’CoinShares describes the acquisition as “part of a larger strategic realignment under the firm’s new leadership.”“Professional investors in the digital asset market desperately need systems that provide efficiency, scale, and sophistication,” stated CoinShares’ CSO Meltum Demirors, adding: “already our clients are responding very positively to this new offering.”“By joining together, our clients will benefit from a broad suite of global, cross-asset trading technology and services,"" said CoinShares CEO, Jean-Marie Mognetti.“We look forward to leveraging the experience of the team, which complements our knowledge of the digital asset market structure,” she added. CoinShares bullish on halvingA report published by CoinShares earlier this week predicted that the halving will have a bullish effect on the supply and demand dynamic underpinning the crypto markets, despite the event likely wreaking havoc on small miners. He wrote:“The pairing of a 50% reduction in available new supply with a reduction in the proportion of ongoing supply offered for sale in the market might drastically reduce the persistent selling pressure caused by miners.““These dynamics, in combination with the macroeconomic tailwinds presented by global governments, and the existing and growing inflows into passive bitcoin investment products we’re currently observing, could cause a perfect storm for the bitcoin price over the mid- to long-term,” he added.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading down just over 2% at its current price of $9,750.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  It does appear that it has now entered a consolidation phase as it struggles to break above the heavy selling pressure laced throughout the lower $10,000 region. Assuming that this consolidation persists, and bulls are unable to make any meaningful progress towards pushing the crypto higher, it could mean that a correction is imminent. Options traders seem to concur with this possibility, as data shows that the put to call ratio has been climbing greatly in recent times. This signals that more traders are forecasting that Bitcoin will be trading lower than where it is currently in the mid-term.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Data from research platform Skew elucidates this trend: “The bitcoin put / call ratio is rising rapidly,” they explained, further adding that “yesterday the four largest contract increases in open interest were puts.” Image Courtesy of Skew Historical Precedent Shows That Rejections at $10,000 Have Dire Consequences  In the time following Bitcoin’s late-2017 crash from highs of $20,000, the five-figure price region has been an important psychological price level for investors. This is leading analysts to note that the probability of a correction here is quite high. “If you’re new and feel like you missed the move to 10k relax. Probabilities say you’ll probably get to buy BTC in the low to mid 8k’s with a little patience. In 2017 we had 5-6 pullbacks of 30% or more (if I recall)… Take this time to learn,” one prominent analyst advised. Jack Purdy – a researcher at Messari – also spoke about this from a data-perspective, saying: “The last three times BTC went past $10,000 it was back under within 90-days.” Image Courtesy of Messari If this trend replicates itself, Bitcoin could be in for a correction.

Chart from Bitcoin chartist Nunya Bizniz. The chart depicts a textbook “descending broadening wedge,” which more often than not break higher. What’s important is that tomorrow, if Bitcoin closes the weekly candle above ~$9,600, it will confirm that it has broken out of the textbook wedge.

Chart from “Credible Crypto,” a top crypto analyst. He called much of the recovery price action early on this year, along with shorter-term forecasts. There Are Macro Tailwinds Too Another analyst or firm expecting $14,000 is Fundstrat Global Advisors, a New York-based market analysis firm that has long had a crypto skew. Finance news outlet MarketWatch indicated that the firm sees the asset hitting $14,350 in the next 12 months. As to why they have this prediction, firm co-founder and head of research, Tom Lee, weighed in via a Twitter comment by sharing four “solid tailwinds”:  Bitcoin is the best-performing “asset class” in 2020, beating U.S. Treasuries and Gold amid a global recession. BTC was the best-performing asset class of 2019, rallying 92% while the U.S. stock market gained around 20%. The block reward reduction, known as a “halving,” is taking place in three days, estimates suggest. Paul Tudor Jones, one of the world’s biggest macro investors, just announced his fund is taking a stake in Bitcoin futures. Jones believes the cryptocurrency will act as a hedge against inflation.

I read the news and then I arrange and rearrange daily, or even by the hour, the pattern of my grief. (Artwork: Amitava Kumar) Grief is now lodged in our lungs. I mean this figuratively. But I also understand that what the novel coronavirus causes is a ground-glass opacity in the lungs, making it very difficult, if not impossible, to breathe. I would persist with the metaphor to describe the heaviness we all are feeling right now except that the literal reality is so overwhelming — at the time of this writing, the deaths from COVID-19 worldwide, the human toll from lungs actually failing to work is 2,71,637. The total number of confirmed cases of those infected by the virus is an unimaginable 39,42,354. Even those not directly carrying the infection are affected because what we have witnessed is an unprecedented alteration in our relationship with the world, our loved ones, and even ourselves. We are each quarantined in our own small spaces of survival or mourning, divided from each other by this cruel disease. Divided also from a sense of calm continuity, or of time unfolding in a predictable way, we now uncertainly await the future with masks on our faces. And in the present, we consume news insatiably, as if that is the oxygen that our lungs needed. But what to do with the news? We read of a doctor in the ICU holding a phone close to a man dying alone while family members cry, or pray, or whisper “I love you”. This is the current definition of the human condition: the grief of the person dying in isolation, the grief of those unable to say goodbye, the grief of those losing a loved one, except it is not just a loved one, it is actually hundreds of thousands all over the world, so that there are no longer spaces available to store the corpses. Let’s not forget also the grief of the health workers who, exhausted, and in many cases ill-supported, have taken on the heartbreaking task of bringing a sense of humanity to a situation where even touch is impossible.  In the present, we consume news insatiably, as if that is the oxygen that our lungs needed. But what to do with the news? (Artwork: Amitava Kumar) We all can see that while the world is drowned in pain, grief is not the only response. During the early weeks of the pandemic, in the footage from Italy, in the beauty of individual as well as collective singing during quarantine, we saw that joy can also be a companion to widespread pain. A disease that has made social distancing necessary for survival has also brought people together in new ways. But grief also has several undesirable companions. Let me give you an example. In the US, where I live and teach in upstate New York, I came across two news events in the weekly review of Harper’s Magazine on April 14. On the one hand, the terribly sad report that “a woman who died alone in a nursing home recorded over 40 messages on an Alexa, many of which asked the device to relieve her pain.” And, on the other hand, showing that corruption rather than compassion has also been a response to grief, there was this list: “Americans have lost approximately $12 million to COVID-19 scams that have included bootleg tests, robocalls advertising non-existent respiratory masks, an app that freezes the user’s phone until they pay a bitcoin ransom, and a silver tincture sold by Jim Bakker.” This pandemic hasn’t generated grief alone. We have experienced, by turns and often together, melancholy, outrage, fear, and last but not least, anger at the bad faith of our rulers everywhere. In India, where some of our products rely more on a robust practice of adulteration, and everything is 50-50 or aadha-aadha, we get aadha grief, aadha gaslighting. Aadha pain, aadha manufactured outrage. Aadha genuine fear, aadha cultivated ignorance. There is nothing pure or sacred, not even sorrow.Advertisement I have received an education in this pandemic from afar. Consider Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey’s advice that 10-15 minutes of sunlight would kill the coronavirus or Baba Ramdev’s propaganda that the herb ashwagandha sold by his company would block the blending of corona protein with human protein. I will also stay mum about the staging by the Prime Minister of a spectacle for nine minutes at 9 pm — or the baffling claim by a doctor, a former head of the Indian Medical Association no less, that the Prime Minister’s call for this nine-minute celebration was based on “Yoga Vasistha, chapter 6, The Principle of Collective Consciousness.”  Each discriminatory gesture, each violent blow, each insidious lie told by either those in power or by the genuflecting media is as familiar to us as the back of our hands. And that, to me, is the cause of the greatest sadness. (Artwork: Amitava Kumar) No, let me only take up what we have all witnessed of ordinary life. You have no doubt seen footage from Chennai where a mob attacked doctors trying to bury one of their fallen comrades; you have also perhaps seen a video of migrant workers being sprayed with the bleach mixture meant for disinfecting metal; you might have seen footage of a female doctor, still wearing her coat and mask, calling from her car to say that glass from her broken windshield had rained on her; you have, of course, seen the footage of police overturning vegetable carts and caning the vendors to enforce lockdown; you may also have seen a video where the police officer asks two small children to move away from the motorbike on which they were traveling with their father and then a constable stepping up to flog the man on his buttocks while the man’s children pleaded on his behalf.Most Read  1 Vishal Bhardwaj thought Kaminey won’t work because nobody was getting along on set: ‘There was so much conflict…’   2 Ganapath box office collection day 2: Tiger Shroff-Kriti Sanon’s dead-on-arrival film fails to crack Rs 5 crore mark after two days   3 ‘SIM Swap fraud’: Delhi advocate receives 3 missed calls from unknown number, loses money from account   4 India versus New Zealand: Mohammed Shami has mastered the art of bowling out batsmen, like Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis did   5 Leo box office collection Day 4 early reports: Vijay’s film makes the best of first weekend  See More  Why do these videos seem so depressingly familiar? They are from this current crisis, but they do not appear particularly novel. Here, I have arrived at an understanding of why grief will not let go. I wake up and the news pours out of my phone. The contagion has produced a new world, no doubt, but everything appears to be only a repetition of all that was there before. For instance, the term “social distancing” is new but we have been adept at practising social ostracism, of class, caste and religion for so long that it has translated rather well into the new realities under lockdown. The videos that I have cited above, they, too, look old because we had seen the same lathis coming down on the defenceless and cowering people earlier, too.Advertisement Each discriminatory gesture, each violent blow, each insidious lie told by either those in power or by the genuflecting media is as familiar to us as the back of our hands. And that, to me, is the cause of the greatest sadness. It is what afflicts me during these days of enforced isolation.

He asserted that the benefits of “stable government, clear or non-threatening regulation, and high levels of ease in opening businesses” afford European miners a myriad of advantages and savings.Philip Salter, Genesis Mining’s head of operations agreed, stating:“Political stability reduces risks, and most of all electricity coming from renewable sources makes it, in the end, the best (aka cheapest) option.”However, GmbH’s Denis Rusinovich asserted that the United States offers miners greater options in terms of financial services when compared to Europe:“The biggest challenge for miners in Europe is poor local development of the ecosystem in contrast to the USA, where there is efficient development in trading, banking, structured products, and most importantly, financing options for miners,”European miners prepare for halvingWhen asked about the region’s prospects for weathering the impending halving, F2Pool’s second in command asserted that European miners are uniquely positioned to weather the halving through needing to invest in efficient technologies.“Mining farms in Europe have, on average, higher electrical costs so they tend to upgrade quickly, use firmware that is more efficient and generally have better-engineered data centers to take advantage of local weather,” he added.Rusinovich describes the halving as a “predefined trigger event,” arguing that miners across the world have been preparing by “[s]ourcing cheaper electricity, buying new more efficient hardware, and hedging financially for the upcoming risk.”Genesis Mining’s Salter predicted that the halving will have the same impact on all miners regardless of the jurisdiction in which they are based, stating:“Operating costs will be more important than before, so the miners that use cheap, renewable power sources will come out on top!” ",2020-05-10

This halving will reduce the inflation rate of BTC by 50%.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Analysts expect this event to be widely bullish for Bitcoin as assuming demand stays the same in the wake of the halving, the decrease in mined supply will skew the supply-demand dynamic in favor of market growth. #2: The Hedge Narrative Is Strengthening  Secondly, the analyst explained that Bitcoin’s narrative as being a hedge against economic downturns is “showing potential,” likely referencing how the cryptocurrency is the best-performing asset this year despite a global recession brewing. He might also be referencing the fact that Bitcoin, which is scarce and decentralized, is gaining credence due to the money-printing by central banks around the world.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Paul Tudor Jones, a legendary macro investor worth over $5 billion, recently touched on this narrative. In a note titled “The Great Monetary Inflation,” the Wall Street veteran argued that Bitcoin is a solid bet against monetary inflation. Screenshot from Jones’ note #3: Bitcoin Has Rallied Strongly From the Lows Thirdly, he remarked that Bitcoin’s “incredible strength from the lows” is convincing him of the bull case. Since the $3,700 lows, a variety of indicators have flipped bullish for Bitcoin. For instance, an indicator with a 100% strike rate recently flipped bullish on the one-day chart. #4: Exchange Dynamics Are Shifting And lastly, he claimed that “Bitcoin exchange dynamics are shifting” in favor of growth. The analyst did not expand on this specific point, but there are two main trends he is likely referring to:  There is less Bitcoin tradable on exchanges: Data from Glassnode indicates that investors are withdrawing their coins off exchanges en-masse and into personal wallets, suggesting a HODL mentality. This means that there is likely less BTC on the order books to be sold. Spot exchanges have registered an increase in buying activity: Spot exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase have registered a noted increase in market activity and popularity over the past two months, suggesting retail investors are flooding in to buy Bitcoin.

Local media report that eight people involved in the case indicated that the bank accounts of the exchanges receiving the funds were frozen. According to an anonymous OTC desk operator:“As it was a very high amount, of R $ 5 million [$900,000], we asked for a bank statement from the original account. When we realized that the money we received had entered the original account on the same day, we blocked the operation.

GOLD PRICES EYE FEDERAL RESERVE BALANCE SHEET GROWTH, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATESChart created by  @RichDvorakFX  with  TradingViewThe price of gold has skyrocketed more than 15% since March 23 when the  Federal Reserve  announced plans to buy Treasury securities “in the amounts needed.” This has accompanied “large-scale” overnight and term repurchase agreement operations conducted by the FOMC. The prospect of unlimited  Fed asset purchases  has provided a boost to gold prices, which is primarily owed to the precious metal’s anti-fiat characteristics.

When I ponder analytical frameworks pertinent to these extraordinary times, none are more germane than Schumpeter's Business Cycle Analysis. Best known for ""creative destruction,"" Schumpeter's seminal work materialized after experiencing the spectacular ""Roaring Twenties"" boom collapse into the Great Depression. Contrary to Milton Friedman and Ben Bernanke, Schumpeter didn't view the twenties as the ""golden age of Capitalism."" Depression was a consequence of egregious boom-time excess rather than the result of the Fed's post-crash failure to print sufficient money. Schumpeter possessed a deep understanding of Credit; he keenly appreciated the roles entrepreneurship and risk-taking played during booms. Schumpeter also understood Capitalism's vulnerabilities. ""Whenever a new production function has been set up successfully and the trade beholds the new thing done and its major problems solved, it becomes much easier for other people to do the same thing and even to improve upon it. In fact, they are driven to copying it if they can, and some people will do so forthwith. It should be observed that it becomes easier not only to do the same thing, but also to do similar things in similar linesâ¦ This seems to offer perfectly simple and realistic interpretations of two outstanding facts of observation: First, that innovations do not remain isolated events, and are not evenly distributed in time, but that on the contrary they tend to cluster, to come about in bunches, simply because first some, and then most, firms follow in the wake of successful innovation; second, that innovations are not at any time distributed over the whole economic system at random, but tend to concentrate in certain sectors and their surroundings."" Joseph A. Schumpeter, Business Cycles, 1939 ""The American debt situation and the American bank epidemicsâ¦ are in a class by themselves. Given the way in which both firms and households had run into debt during the twenties, the accumulated loadâ¦ was instrumental in precipitating depression. In particular, it set into motion a vicious spiral within which everybody's efforts to reduce that loan for a time, only availed to increase it. There is thus no objection to the debt-deflation theory of the American crisis, provided it does not mean more than this. The element it stresses is part of the mechanism of any serious depression. But increase of total indebtedness at the rate at which it had occurred in this country is neither a normal element of the mechanisms of Kondratieff downgrades nor in itself an 'understandable' incident, like speculative excesses and the debts induced by these. It must be attributed to the humor of the times, to cheap money policies, and to the practices of concerns eager to push their sales; and it enters the class of understandable incidents only if we include specifically American conditions among our data. Similarly, bank failures are of course very regular occurrences in the course of any major crisis and invariably an important cause of secondary phenomenaâ¦Those epidemics cannot, however, be considered as wholly explained by the ordinary mechanism of crises or by the mechanism plus the fact of excessive indebtedness all round or even by all that plus the stock exchange crash. The American epidemics become fully understandable only if account be taken of the weaknesses peculiar to the American banking structureâ¦"" Joseph A. Schumpeter, Business Cycles, 1939 We live in extraordinary, unprecedented times. The timing of the COVID-19 pandemic - on the heels of an unparalleled period of synchronized global economic growth; a record-setting U.S. economic expansion; and worldwide financial and asset price booms - ensures far-reaching financial, economic, social, political and geopolitical ramifications. COVID Strikes Mercilessly at Peak Fragility. Fragilities have been mounting across economic and financial systems - at home and abroad. The pandemic is pushing many over the edge. Not only are central banks and governments fighting the immediate effects of the coronavirus, they are these days in epic battle against Business Cycle Dynamics. In particular, bursting Bubbles have central banks more determined than ever to do ""whatever it takes"" to fulfill their so-called ""price stability"" mandate. There were deflation worries following the 1987 stock market crash. Deflationary risks were key to the Greenspan Fed's aggressive early-nineties stimulus measures (and championing of ""Wall Street finance""). Global deflation fears were acute during the 1997 bursting of the ""Asian Tiger Bubbles"" and even more so the next year with the Russia/LTCM collapse. Dr. Bernanke joined the Fed in 2002 after the ""tech"" Bubble collapse, as the Fed formulated a major push against the scourge of deflation. After the bursting of the mortgage finance Bubble, global bazookas were mobilized for an all-out assault against deflationary forces. Of late, a nuclear arsenal has supplanted the impotent bazookas. I'm convinced policymakers are ""fighting the last war"" with perilously misguided armaments. The Schumpeterian framework supports my case. The past 25 years accomplished the greatest period of innovation and technological advancement since the ""Roaring Twenties."" Concurrently, the world experienced an unparalleled period of financial innovation - specifically a historic shift from traditional bank lending to a system dominated by market-based finance and central bank intervention. Real economy innovation fueled finance, and financial excess stoked entrepreneurship and risk-taking. In combination, innovation in both real economies and finance fueled historic changes in financial and economic structure. The Federal Reserve has essentially employed highly accommodative monetary policy for the past thirty years. After beginning the nineties at about 450, the Nasdaq Composite traded this past February to an all-time high 9,838 (closing Friday at 9,121). Except for a few fleeting periods of instability, free-flowing finance has supported (""cluster"" upon historic ""cluster"" of) innovation. The Credit expansion has been unrelenting, with Non-Financial Debt surging from $10.5 TN to begin the nineties to today's $55 TN. Central bankers are these days keener than ever to fixate on their inflation mandate and targets. That inflation dynamics have evolved profoundly over recent decades is apparently not worthy of discussion. The impetus is to stimulate more aggressively than ever. Schumpeterian ""clusters"" - explosive innovation and adoption of new technologies - have altered the nature of contemporary output, economic structure and inflation dynamics. Incredible expansion of technology hardware, software, digitized output and related services fundamentally altered the economy's structural capacity to readily expand the supply of output. What started with the low-cost personal computers mushroomed with the adoption of the Internet. The past decade's unprecedented monetary stimulus and booming markets saw frenzied multiplication of innovation ""clusters"" (i.e. Internet-based products, ""cloud""-related services, ""Internet of things,"" robotics, biotech and pharmaceuticals, alternative energy, the ""sharing economy,"" autonomous vehicles, and so on). Technological innovation and adoption help explain why aggressive monetary stimulus and system-wide ""loose money"" have not been associated with higher consumer price inflation. A veritable endless supply of ""tech"" output readily absorbs any additional purchasing power making its way into the real economy. Meanwhile, mounting Credit and speculative excess primarily fueled inflation in asset prices and Bubbles. Moreover, this combination of booming finance and asset markets provided major impetus to U.S. economic structural mutation. Deindustrialization took root, with American manufacturing suffering at the hands of cheaper imports. Meanwhile, booming financial markets and surging household wealth propelled a structural shift to a services-based economy. A confluence of U.S. financial innovation and excess, policy experimentation, economic restructuring and resulting massive Current Account Deficits propelled ""globalization"" - and, with it, systemic Global Bubble Dynamics. In the process, inflation dynamics were fundamentally and momentously transformed. If things seem too good to be true, they probably are. There are critical issues associated with current inflation, financial, economic and policy structures. The COVID-19 pandemic is illuminating many. Let's start with inflation. With global Bubbles bursting, there will be associated downward pressures on some price levels (i.e. energy and commodities). Demand will wane for many products and services. Yet broken supply chains are pushing some prices higher. Meanwhile, the world is afflicted with unprecedented debt burdens. Central bankers are fully committed to doing ""whatever it takes"" to drive aggregate consumer inflation up to target. The nature of inflation has evolved profoundly, yet central banks adhere to the doctrine of a general price level that they can manipulate higher through monetary stimulus. This capacity for policy measures to inflate THE general price level is fundamental to the view that consequences of Credit excess and market Bubbles can be readily mitigated. And this gets to the heart of this dangerous flaw in contemporary economic doctrine: that boomtime Credit and financial excess can, for the most part, be disregarded. Asset inflation and Bubbles are to be ignored (promoted?), focusing instead on preparation for aggressive faltering-Bubble reflationary measures. In reality, deflation is a symptom - a consequence. The problem is excessive debt, speculative leverage, asset market Bubbles and deep economic structural maladjustment. Importantly, there is today no general price level to manipulate higher to inflate out of debt and structural problems. Aggressive reflationary efforts will instead only add to unmanageable debt loads, while further straining financial and economic structures. As we're already witnessing, Trillions of Fed ""money"" creation ensure market and price level instabilities. Moreover, stimulus measures at this point dangerously exacerbate wealth inequality, and with it social, political and geopolitical instability. From the New York Times (Nelson D. Schwartz, Ben Casselman and Ella Koeze): ""People with the least education have been hardest hit in the downturnâ¦ The unemployment rate for workers without a high school diploma stood at 21.2% in April, compared with 8.4% for those with a college degreeâ¦ Workers earning under $15 an hour account for more than one-third of job losses, far beyond their share of the work force."" And from the Washington Post (Heather Long): ""What's clear so far is that Hispanics, African-Americans and low-wage workers in restaurants and retail have been the hardest hit by the job crisis. Many of these workers were already living paycheck-to-paycheck and had the least cushion before the pandemic hit. 'Low-wage workers are experiencing their own Great Depression right now,' said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Instituteâ¦ The unemployment rate in April jumped to a record 18.9% for Hispanics, 16.7% for African-Americans and 14.2% for whites."" We're witnessing a down-cycle at Pandemic Mach One. Twenty million jobs lost in April. Yet the S&amp;P500 returned almost 13% during the month. The Nasdaq Composite surged 15.5%. Much would remain ambiguous in a typically gradual downturn. Not so with COVID-19. There are no subtleties and little complexity- it's clear for all to see. How can much of society not be convinced Federal Reserve support primarily benefits Wall Street and the wealthy? If you are employed in the service sector, odds are you're facing terrible hardship. If you are fortunate enough to work for Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Tesla, Netflix, Zoom, or even most tech or biotech companies - with your stock and option grants you've likely rarely done better. Covid-19 is laying bare the stark inequity of the current structure. The ""trickle down"" argument, having remained tenable during the long boom, has in six weeks been blown completely out of the water.

Federal Reserve Credit rose another $65.5bn last week to a record $6.664 TN, pushing the nine-week gain to a staggering $2.519 TN. M2 ""money supply"" (with a week's lag) expanded another $333bn, with a nine-week rise of $2.059 TN. Institutional Money Fund Assets (not included in M2) added $25bn, boosting its nine-week expansion to $946bn. Meanwhile, a magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck this week along the European Fault Line. May 6 - UK Telegraph (Ambrose Evans-Pritchard): ""Germany's top court has fired a cannon shot across the bows of the European Central Bank and accused the European Court of breaching EU treaty law, marking an epic clash of rival judicial supremacy. In an explosive judgement, the German constitutional court ruled that the ECB had exceeded its legal mandate and 'manifestly' breached the principle of proportionality with mass bond purchases, now topping â¬2.2 trillion and set to rise dramatically. The bank had strayed from the monetary realm into broad economic policy-making. The court said the German Bundesbank may continue to buy bonds during a three-month transition but must then desist from any further role in the 'implementation and execution' of the offending measures, until the ECB can justify its actions and meet the court's objections. It also said the Bundesbank must clarify how it is going to sell the bonds it already owns. 'For the first time in history, the constitutional court has found that the actions and decisions of European bodies overstep their legitimate competence, and therefore have no validity in Germany,' said the court's president, Andreas Vosskuhle. No country has dared to do this before since the creation of the Community in 1957. It is a revolutionary moment for the European project. Olaf Scholz, the German finance minister, said the court had set 'very clear boundaries' and that Europe would henceforth have to find other ways to keep monetary union on the road."" May 5 - Bloomberg (Stephanie Bodoni): ""The European Union's top court faced the most stinging attack in its 68-year history -- not from Brexiteers, but from its German counterpart. In a long-awaited ruling on the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program, Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe accused the EU Court of Justice of overstepping its powers when it backed the ECB's controversial policy. The German court said the EU judges' December 2018 ruling that QE was in line with EU rules was 'objectively arbitrary' and is 'methodologically no longer justifiable.' It gave the ECB a three-month ultimatum to fix flaws in the measure. 'This is a declaration of war on the ECJ, and it will have consequences,' said Joachim Wieland, a law professor at the University of Administrative Sciences, who sees the real challenge in the future relationship between the EU court and national constitutional tribunals. 'It's an invitation for other countries to simply ignore decisions that they don't like.'"" May 8 - Reuters (Gabriela Baczynska): ""The European Union's top court said on Friday it alone has the power to decide whether EU bodies are breaching the bloc's rules, in a rebuke to Germany's highest court, which this week rejected its judgment approving the ECB's trillion-euro bond purchasesâ¦ 'In order to ensure that EU law is applied uniformly, the Court of Justice alone - which was created for that purpose by the member states - has jurisdiction to rule that an act of an EU institution is contrary to EU law,' the court said in a statement."" May 7 - Financial Times (Martin Arnold): ""Christine Lagarde has fended off criticism of the European Central Bank's government bond purchases, saying she was 'undeterred' by an order from Germany's highest court to produce a justification of its action. Speaking publicly for the first time since its flagship bond-buying policy was challenged by the German constitutional court, the ECB president said the pandemic meant the Frankfurt-based institution - as well as other central banks - 'have to go beyond the normal tools to use exceptional measures . . . to avoid a tightening [of financing costs] and to ensure our monetary policy is transmitted across the euro area'. 'We are an independent institution, answerable to the European Parliament, and driven by our mandate,"" she saidâ¦ 'We will continue to do whatever is needed, whatever is necessary, to deliver on that mandate. Undeterred.'"" Christine Lagarde is undeterred. For the most part, markets remain undeterred (though European yields rose this week). Likely business as usual for the Bundesbank for the next three months. But then significant uncertainty. Once again, COVID-19 timing is awe-inspiring. While Germany's Constitutional Court ruled previous QE was not categorically illegal monetary financing, the latest $800 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) clearly crosses the line. Things appear headed in the direction of a real mess. Timing unclear. German Constitutional Court vs. European Court of Justice (ECJ). Additional lawsuits out of Germany challenging ""whatever it takes"" PEPP ECB QE. Other national courts - and governments - emboldened to flaunt sovereignty and challenge a weakened European Union. Germany's Bundesbank is in a tough spot, split between the German Constitutional Court (along with its sound money principles) and its role as the largest member of the ECB. Does the ECB continue ""disproportional"" support for Italian debt markets, inviting a confrontation with Germany's Constitutional Court? Does the Italian debt market begin fretting a world with less certainty of unlimited ECB buying? This week saw a meaningful chink in the armor of European monetary integration. ""It is of the utmost importance to realize this: given the actual facts which it was then possible for either businessman or economists to observe, those diagnoses - or even the prognosis that, with the existing structure of debt, those facts plus a drastic fall in price level would cause major trouble but that nothing else would - were not simply wrong. What nobody saw, though some people may have felt it, was that those fundamental data from which diagnoses and prognoses were made, were themselves in a state of flux and that they would be swamped by the torrents of a process of readjustment corresponding in magnitude to the extent of the industrial revolution of the preceding 30 years. People, for the most part, stood their ground firmly. But that ground itself was about to give way."" Joseph A.

Figures released Thursday by the Fed, running to May 5, confirm again that Japan has been by a distance the largest user of the swaps. So far, 46% of the $791.09 billion in lending has been to the Bank of Japan.

And I think it will be very conclusive,' Trump saidâ¦ 'My opinion is they made a mistake. They tried to cover it. They tried to put it out, just like a fire.'"" May 4 - Bloomberg (Nick Wadhams and Peter Martin): ""China's leaders risk a popular backlash if they don't loosen controls on free speech and let its people have a stronger hand in their government, a senior White House official said in a speech likely to further exacerbate tensions with Beijing.

'We discovered a new virus,' says the warrior. 'So what?' replies the Statue of Liberty. 'It's only a flu.'

'Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by 'enormous evidence,' then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool,' the editorial said.

Bitcoin’s decline is increasing pressure on ETH and it could decline further to $175.  ETH price is gaining bearish momentum and it broke the key $200 support zone against the US Dollar. It is now trading below $192 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $205 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair is likely to continue lower towards the next major support at $175 or $165.  Ethereum Price Turns Red This past week, Ethereum made a couple of attempts to gain bullish momentum above the $210 resistance area against the US Dollar, but it failed. ETH price formed a local top near the $215 level and started a strong decline. The recent decline in bitcoin below the $9,000 support sparked heavy bearish moves in Ether.

Chainlink was just added to Gemini, the New York-based crypto exchange run by the Winklevoss Twins, some of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls. This listing, which also sees five other digital assets now supported by the platform, came shortly after Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said: “I really appreciate the passion of the LINK Marines. Their fervor and dedication reminds me of the early Bitcoin and Ethereum communities. Unlike many other crypto armies, they are dedicated to a project that has real promise and technical merit.” Also in the vein of the adoption of the popular cryptocurrency, ParaFi Capital, a crypto fund, has proposed that LINK should be supported by the Ethereum-based DeFi platform MakerDAO.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  The reasons: Chainlink is the 12th largest crypto asset and the project has seen mounds of support within the DeFi community. The discussion of LINK being added to Maker garnered much steam that Rune Christensen, founder of MakerDAO, wrote: “Even assets that are correlated with ETH, like LINK, would help to source more Dai generation and help with restoring the peg and DSR.” Bitcoin’s the Crypto Market’s Focus While this could play out, Bitcoin is the focus of the crypto market at the moment. Sharing the chart seen below, the lead technical analyst at crypto research firm Blockfyre remarked that as Bitcoin slows down, “altcoins are really going to struggle,” adding that it’s an absolutely “brutal’ outlook for this segment of the market. He added that there is “max pain ahead” in his opinion. Chart from @pentosh1, the lead technical analyst at crypto research firm Blockfyre.

A move to $6,400 would mark another 25% worth of losses from the current price point. Chart from “Dave the Wave” (@davthewave on Twitter).

The analyst went as far as to say that he’s so convinced by these factors that he is “really struggling to see a bearish case” for Bitcoin here. The fundamental trends are as follows:      Bitcoin’s block reward halving is currently two days away. Analysts expect this event to be widely bullish for Bitcoin as assuming demand stays the same in the wake of the halving, the decrease in mined supply should result in higher prices. Bitcoin’s narrative of being a hedge against economic downturns is “showing potential.” The cryptocurrency has seen a strong recovery from the March lows, rallying more than 100%. BTC’s “exchange dynamics are shifting,” presumably referencing the decrease in order book supply due to long-term holders and the increase in buying activity on spot exchanges.  The bullish macro sentiment has been echoed by Fundstrat Global Advisors, a New York-based research firm. The firm’s co-founder recently identified four macro tailwinds for Bitcoin, while an analyst at the firm suggested that the cryptocurrency could hit $14,350 within the next 12 months.

It liquidated $200 million worth of longs, obliterating the futures market.The three key reasons that triggered the immense Bitcoin correction were: strong multi-year resistance area above $10,000, whales moving to short the market on BitMEX, and extreme volatility heading into the halving.$10,200 to $10,500 is a multi-year strong resistance area for BitcoinSince mid-2018, the $10,200 to $10,500 range served as a historically strong area of resistance for the top-ranking cryptocurrency by market capitalization.After its first breakout above $10,500 in June 2019, which led to a swift run to $14,000, Bitcoin failed to move above that level five out of six times in the last two years.Bitcoin rejects $10,000 ahead of halving. Source: TradingviewWhen the Bitcoin price initially broke down at $10,100 on May 8, it signaled the rejection of a key resistance level and left BTC vulnerable to a steep correction.As whales started to sell at $9,900, it led to a cascade of long contract liquidations primarily on BitMEX and Binance Futures. In one hour, more than $200 million worth of longs were liquidated.Whales quickly moved to sell BTC at the point of rejectionAlmost as soon as the rejection of $10,200 was confirmed, whales started to fiercely short Bitcoin across major cryptocurrency exchanges.The open interest on the big four derivatives exchanges that include Binance Futures, BitMEX, Deribit and OKEx plunged. The term open interest refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open at a given time.Open interest of BitMEX Bitcoin futures contract. Source: HsakaThe rapid decline in open interest meant that as selling pressure began to build up, it caused over-leveraged buyers in the futures market to get trapped in their positions.The funding rate on Bybit, Binance Futures and BitMEX remained at around -0.05%. A negative funding rate when the price of BTC is going down means that the overwhelming majority of the market is holding short contracts, expecting BTC to drop further.In other words, many traders, especially whales, betting against BTC at a critical reversal point of a long-term trend triggered a sharp drop in a short period of time.Massive volatility ahead of halvingAhead of the Bitcoin block reward halving set to occur on May 12, trading activity on all major cryptocurrency platforms surged significantly.CME saw record-high open interest, Deribit recorded all-time high volume for its options contracts, and spot exchanges demonstrated 2017-esque volume in the last three weeks.When many new investors enter the market in anticipation of a major event, it opens the market up for a steep selloff.For instance, after the 2016 block reward halving, the Bitcoin price dropped by more than 30%, as traders reacted with a sell-the-news response.A confluence of an over-extended Bitcoin rally to $10,000, whales front-running retail investors with a sharp sell-off at $9,900, and high anticipation for the halving are triggering a near-term pullback prior to the May 12 Bitcoin halving.

Chart from “HornHairs” (@CryptoHornhairs on Twitter). The chart indicates that Bitcoin could maintain some semblance of a bullish market structure should a key level hold. Even if Bitcoin closes below $8,530, analysts say that there are other support levels below BTC that will give credence to the case for upside. During the move to $8,100, for instance, Bitcoin managed to hold both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This is important as these moving averages are inflection points for markets — crypto is no exception.

This could spell bad news for miners, but probably not for the reason you’re thinking of. We’re all aware that Binance is continuing to extend its reach across the industry. The exchange’s purchase of CoinMarketCap for a reported $400 million signaled a bold step toward grabbing attention at the top of the crypto funnel, and its recent foray into mining just ahead of the 2020 halving shows that Binance is also interested in having influence at the source.By all accounts, the company culture at Binance appears to be one of innovation and experimentation. CEO Changpeng Zhao is known to be approachable, and when good ideas come from within the company, it is able to exercise its enormous user base and war chest to enter new markets.The question is, what impact will Binance’s pool have on miners themselves?To start with, the impact may be minimal. Binance’s initial target market will be miners who currently mine via the pools of other Chinese exchanges, such as Huobi and OKEx. There is fierce competition among those exchanges, and Binance launching a pool can be viewed through this lens. Binance even recruited directly from within Huobi as well as Bitmain to build its own pool’s business development team.It’s still early days, but the change in global hashrate distribution since Binance launched their pool tells the same story. Both Huobi and OKEx have lost a couple of percentage points of share in global hashrate. OKExPool and Huobi fell from 6.74% and 5.92%, respectively in April 2020 to 4.5% and 4.0% at the start of May, while Binance has attracted 4.5% of the network’s hashrate since launch.Meanwhile, established mining pools such as F2Pool and SlushPool have seen a growth in their share of hashrate during the same period.Up until now, Huobi and OKEx have predominantly used their pools as a way to attract exchange customers and support the services already on offer. While the older pools compete in a different way.Exchanges have massive reserves of Bitcoin and other liquid assets. They can operate at a loss, or close to cost, for extended periods of time.Edward Evenson from SlushPool and Ethan Vera from Luxor recently discussed this short-term advantage on the mining pool-focused HASHR8 Podcast. They posited that Binance’s pool will be used as a loss leader because it can afford to drive prices into the ground. As Edward Evenson, director of business development at SlushPool, said:“When you have 80,000 BTC on reserve, it becomes pretty easy to do whatever you want, especially when you’re vertically integrated across a bunch of different sectors of the industry.”Another reason why Binance may be focused on the Chinese mining market is that the majority of their team, their base and their connections are still mostly in China. It also makes good business sense: 65% to 70% of the global hashrate is in China.My concerns about this are not the typical narratives of over-centralization in China, as were recently expressed by Philip Salter from Genesis Mining. Indeed, as with the lessons everybody can learn from how Genesis handled their customers’ hashrate during the 2018 bear market, it’s much more important to focus on how you treat miners than where your company is based.I’m of an opinion similar to my Australian colleague, Thomas Heller — global business director at F2Pool — who was also part of the debate on the HASHR8 Podcast. He underlined:“The people who launched Bitcoin companies in Asia, such as pools or manufacturers, are Bitcoiners. They’re no different to Bitcoiners in Europe, North America or elsewhere.”Bitcoin mining and the real threatCentralization is not a direct function of geographic location. Bitcoin doesn’t have a nationality, and pools don’t need to be labeled that way, either. As well as the increased development of farms in North America, large mining operators own and run machines in China, Russia, Kazakhstan and anywhere else with an abundance of low-cost energy — regardless of where the operators call home.The fundamental risks in China are outside the control of Bitcoiners, and it makes sense for everyone who wants to profit from contributing to the security of Bitcoin try to find ways to not be dependent on single points of failure. Economic factors such as the proliferation of hardware manufacturers and the logistical benefits of mining without having to export the machines halfway around the world will continue to support a disproportionate level of mining activity in that region.Bitcoin mining is a permissionless, antifragile system where the barriers to entry are low-cost electricity and access to efficient hardware.The future success of SBI’s focus on supplying hardware for large North American mining operations, or the potential entrance of even more well-equipped manufacturers like Samsung could change the mining landscape reasonably quickly. As low as electricity prices are in China now due to the lasting wet season, not even they can compete with some of the opportunities being explored by the likes of the Peter Theil-backed Texan’s Layer One or Greenidge Generation in New York.So the threat that Binance poses is not geographic. The real threat is whether this crypto behemoth will drag down the circular economy that currently exists for the established pools. SlushPool is the oldest pool, and it spends a large portion of its resources developing proposals such as Stratum V2. F2Pool had a loud voice in the SegWit 2x debates, and history suggests its founders came down on the right side of the argument. These kinds of pools make their profits by building up a reputation and experience in mining Bitcoin.The real risk is Binance turning mining into a short-term game where the only rules are how low you can offer fees. What will be the consequence if pools focusing on the long-term success of their miners get squeezed out? As with everything within the beautiful game that Satoshi created: The market will decide.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Malcolm Cannon is the head of communications at F2Pool, which has been proudly securing Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains since 2013. As one of the oldest mining pools, F2Pool is busy decentralizing its team and infrastructure. Cannon currently lives in Berlin, where he spent the past seven years leading startup growth teams through successful Seed and Series A fundraising rounds.  ",2020-05-10

I don’t know about “Neo-Illiberalism” as a neologism; it’s not euphonious. Just spitballing here, but perhaps “geo-fascism” or “globo-fascism” might do better. Perhaps debt + the platforms (both global, by the way) provide a functional replacement for the beatdowns of the “mass-based party of committed nationalist militants.” Scholars and students of fascism please comment! By Reijer Hendrikse, a postdoctoral researcher based at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. Originally published at Open Democracy. Crisis Redux As the coronavirus and its political combatants hold the world hostage, it is pertinent to scrutinize the (geo) political and economic context within which the pandemic has emerged. Many analyses view neoliberalism as the culprit, having given rise to a dismantling and marketization of public services such as healthcare for which we are now paying the price. The virus confirms the bankruptcy of neoliberal capitalism, based upon global production networks of western corporations and Chinese factories, allowing the virus to spread across the globe. Alas, neoliberalism is in trouble once again, perhaps terminally ill. That said, the death of neoliberalism has been pronounced before, not least in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis, from which it however quickly resurfaced stronger than before. Moreover, western neoliberalism has witnessed a significant mutation over the last years, not least to better accommodate the changing logics of global capitalism. The coronavirus offers an opening to change the world for the better, not least by undoing decades of neoliberalization to give vital professions in health care and education the appreciation they deserve. Unfortunately, as detailed in Naomi Klein’s 'The Shock Doctrine', crises also offer ample opportunity for the established order to realize ambitions which are inconceivable in normal times. The global political economy before the outbreak of corona was defined by the rise of a global billionaire class, tech platforms, and illiberal(izing) nationalist politics, having jointly propelled a novel wave of (geo) political-economic restructuring which I have called neo-illiberalism. What will be the effects of coronavirus on this new status quo? The New Normal Alongside the 2008 financial crisis, the votes for Brexit and Trump have often been described as ruptures to the neoliberal status quo. But as in the wake of 2008, the aftermath of 2016 also brought about more of the same: more tax cuts for corporations and the rich, more environmental and financial deregulation, more cuts in public services i.e. more policies of neoliberal signature. That said, the politics peddling the same neoliberal policies has substantially changed. Where preceding waves of neoliberalization have been variably executed by centrist parties, seeing the center right commit itself to progressive politics in exchange for center-left support for economic neoliberalization, since 2016 a new alliance has emerged between center and far right, seeing the latter mainstream as center-right parties such as the US Republicans and UK Conservatives have steadily radicalized themselves, thereby forsaking their erstwhile commitment to what Tariq Ali has called ‘the extreme center’. Notwithstanding the fact that center-right parties co-produced the neoliberal world order, they have since come to reinvent themselves as nationalist challengers to the ‘globalist’ status quo, which they habitually present as leftist. Where preceding waves of neoliberalization resulted in the limitation of democratic control over economic policymaking, the present nationalist wave captained by Donald Trump and his copycats is defined by efforts of political illiberalization, brazenly seeking to undo the institutional setup of liberal-democratic checks and balances, seeing legislative and judicial branches of government subjected to a power-hungry executive. Wider societal counter-powers are also under attack, from academia and media to NGOs, along with attacks on a range of constitutional basic and/or fundamental rights constraining the illiberal exercise of absolute power. While this development heralds the end of progressive neoliberalism, political illiberalization ultimately still protects the encasement of global capitalism, the core aim of the neoliberal project. The rise of neo-illiberalism might be compared to a virus, whereby western liberal democracies increasingly come to resemble illiberal democracies and (competitive) authoritarian regimes elsewhere. Where illiberalizing regimes in Hungary and Poland are infecting the neoliberal European Union (EU) as a whole, not least because of center-right political cover offered by the European Peoples Party (EPP), neo-illiberalism constitutes a fundamentally global phenomenon. For example, Brazil and India have recently embraced political illiberalization without rejecting neoliberal economics, whereas illiberal China and Russia have equally tightened their authoritarian rule. Amongst others, what unites these and other regimes is the mobilization of divisive nationalisms, seeing variegated ‘strongmen’ adapt state constitutions to their will, typically bulldozering pluralist political space whilst shielding the respective neoliberal interfaces between national economy and global capitalism. Global Capitalism To grasp the rise of neo-illiberalism we need to go back to the turn of the millennium, a time in which the various developments culminating in the neo-illiberal synthesis were put in motion. Next to the terrorist attacks on US soil which ignited the gradual mainstreaming of far-right narratives, the year 2001 is characterized by the entry of illiberal China into the neoliberal World Trade Organization (WTO). Meeting in serene Doha following the riots of Seattle, China’s WTO entrance heralded a larger geographical shift captured by the famous BRIC acronym (Brazil, Russia, India, China) coined that year by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O’Neill. O’Neill foresaw stronger economic growth in the non-west, and called upon western leaders to incorporate leading non-western states into key governance platforms, which was realized later that decade by elevating the Group of Twenty (G20) as the world’s leading forum on global governance. Alongside the search for new markets and cheap labor, the 2000s were characterized by the ascent of the financial offshore world – a legal realm comprised of tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions where corporations and the rich stash their cash and property – which became global capitalism’s central operating system by the turn of the millennium. Since then, offshore money from Russia and elsewhere flooded into cities like London, igniting a spending spree on real estate, football clubs, media conglomerates, and political influence. Amongst others things, the offshore world enabled spectacular corporate fraud, such as that which led to the collapse of US energy giant Enron, whose accounting gimmicks were copy-pasted by western banks, setting the stage for the financial crisis later that decade. The final key development traced back to the turn of the millennium is the birth of digital platforms. Invented by Google as what Susanna Zuboff calls ‘an automated architecture functioning as a one-way mirror’, surveillance capitalism has since grown into a worldwide machine dedicated to behavioral observation, manipulation and modification, steadily enmeshing itself with the core logics of capital accumulation. Crucially, digitization accelerated the aforementioned trends: not only has digitization fueled global capital flight into offshore anonymity, it also augmented the mainstreaming of far-right narratives via YouTube and Facebook algorithms. Much like the invisible offshore world, the rise of surveillance capitalism largely went unnoticed, assisted by anti-terrorism legislation like the 2001 Patriot Act enabling far-reaching surveillance. Growing up under the radar of the war on terror and financial turmoil, the first decade of the twenty-first century saw the birth of a fundamentally global, offshore, digitized and financialized hyper capitalism. Descriptions like shadow banks, phantom investments and dark money do not do justice to their role as fundamental building blocks of the new world. Amongst others factors, the offshore world was the ground zero of the financial crisis, where banks kept their toxic investments. This new world is the ‘home’ of trillion-dollar tech companies, who with other (shell) companies form an integrated web of corporate structures whose chief ultimate owners constitute a global billionaire class of approximately two thousand individuals and families. As such, this is also the world where neoliberal technocracy is increasingly fused with oligarchy. Due to the spectacular growth of income and wealth inequality worldwide, oligarchic enmeshment of the superrich and state power does not only define elites in Russia or the Gulf, but increasingly defines western states such as the US, where multibillionaire activists like the Koch brothers have effectively taken over the Republican Party. Next to the economic recovery, the 2010s were defined by the increasing coalescence of financial and technology sectors. Within a development model labeled The Wall Street Consensus by political economist Daniela Gabor, an adaption of the neoliberal Washington Consensus within the framework of the G20, banks and financial institutions worldwide have come to embrace financial technology (fintech), driven by an insatiable hunger for personal data as raw materials for financialized surveillance capitalism. Crucially, where Silicon Valley long enjoyed a global tech monopoly, the 2010s saw the arrival of Chinese bigtech vying for global dominance. The western financial lobby has voiced its fears of Chinese platforms like Alibaba and Tencent, which they describe as all American bigtechs ‘rolled into one’ operating under tight control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). These fears are not unfounded: where Facebook encountered many difficulties in building a global cryptocurrency, the Chinese central bank has developed its own alternative, and the CCP has recently ordered China’s banks and tech platforms to adopt it. In the words of Mark Zuckerberg: the American state has to play a more active role ‘otherwise our financial leadership is not guaranteed’. Whilst the rest of the world has steadily bought into Chinese technology, the other BRICs have embraced (parts of) China’s digital strategy. For example, where a small minority of India’s 1.4 billion population had a bank account in 2014, this number has since risen beyond a billion. That said, these bank accounts are coupled to biometric personal data, and critics identify this policy as part of Narenda Modi’s political agenda to transform India into a Hindu nationalist surveillance state. Taken together, around the time the coronavirus made the first news headlines, the New York Times identified three competing visions on the future of surveillance capitalism: where the Chinese are ‘moving fast and breaking things’ without any regard for privacy and citizen rights, and the EU tries to make a moral point around privacy and consent, with the US caught in the middle. Nationalist Leninism Although ‘moving fast and breaking things’ is a good description for Xi Jinping’s China, it should be remembered that this philosophy has long guided Silicon Valley, where asking for forgiveness trumps begging for permission. The disruption of established industries, practices and processes defines platforms like Uber, operating without any regard for the law or basic decency. With the rise of western neo-illiberalism, moreover, this philosophy has also entered into government. Brexit, for example, is best understood as a process of continuous disruption of established political practices and procedures, from shunning press conferences to unlawfully closing down parliament. As The Economist noted: ‘The Tories’ disruptive strategies would not be out of place in Silicon Valley’. Where rampant digitization has disrupted a range of established industries since the turn of the millennium, and set its sights on incumbent finance in the wake of the financial crisis, the 2010s are marked by tech’s infiltration of established politics. Where Facebook and Google place their own employees in US political campaigns ever since the rise of Barack Obama, an entire ecosystem of techno-metapolitical players has since grown up around these platforms: next to dedicated bots and troll farms there now exists a media network dedicated to mainstream far-right narratives, of which Breitbart News – financed by US billionaire Robert Mercer, captained by the identitarian demagogue Steve Bannon – is the most prominent. The adoption of far-right narratives by established media, whether global corporate players like NewsCorp or national public broadcasters, brought right-wing culture wars into the established arena of mass-mediated politics. Other crucial players in this ecosystem are data analytics firms, like Cambridge Analytica (CA), again featuring Mercer and Bannon, as well as Palantir Technologies owned by US tech billionaire Peter Thiel. Where CA founder Alexander Nix was schooled at the elitist Eton College alongside David Cameron and Boris Johnson, Thiel not only enjoys the ear of Trump as advisor, but also those of Mark Zuckerberg as Facebook board member, where he kept the company from fact checking political advertisements. Where US journalist Jane Mayer speaks of ‘the Fox News White House’ to highlight the close relationship between Trump and the world’s second most powerful media magnate, in the digital age the world’s first Twitter presidency might equally be labeled the Facebook White House to emphasize the ways in which Trump has become a digitally mass-mediated virus enabled by the world’s most powerful media magnate. As argued by Trump’s digital campaign manager: ‘without Facebook we wouldn’t have won’. The global rise of neo-illiberalism is covered with the fingerprints of tech firms: where WhatsApp-mediated memes helped Jair Bolsonaro assume power in Brazil, the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte was an early adopter of Facebook’s political capabilities. Once in power, moreover, these ‘strongmen’ act like disruptive tech CEOs whilst demolishing liberal democracy, and embrace surveillance tools to anchor their rule: in India, for example, encrypted WhatsApp was recently found to be hacked, allowing Modi to track his political opponents. But although Israeli spyware and Russian hackers play an important role in the cross-border spread of neo-illiberal politics, to fully grasp the political possibilities of the digital age we need to redirect our gaze to Beijing, where digital technology is paramount in the exercise of social control. In combining economic neoliberalization with illiberal political control since the late 1970s, the CCP has been one of the world’s neo-illiberal vanguards. Experts describe the governing ideology of the CCP as a curious combination of nationalism and Leninism, following China’s ideological rejection of both the French and Russian revolutions, which according to Wang Hui shaped up after the Cultural Revolution and was settled on Tiananmen Square. Crucially, the rejection of ‘two major emancipation movements – socialism and liberalism’ – is exactly what the western far right is after. In other words, what emerges under neo-illiberalism is a global ideological convergence. Just consider this: at the height of the so-called European ‘refugee crisis’ in 2015, which accelerated the mainstreaming of far-right narratives across the west, neo-illiberal China also saw the emergence of its own Alt-Right lingo for ‘libtards’ or ‘regressive liberals’, with derogatory terms like baizuo (白左) i.e. ‘white left’ popping up across the blogosphere. Since 2016, this cocktail of nationalism and Leninism has put its mark on the west, with nationalist projects like America First! and Brexit being guided by self-proclaimed Leninists, like Bannon or Boris Johnson’ advisor Dominic Cummings. Enabled by far-right culture wars informed by another communist – Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci – these disruptive Leninists have set their eyes on breaking down liberal democracy and the rule of law. To do so, they pretend to represent ‘the will of the people’, and relentlessly discredit the core infrastructure of liberal democracy, framing its key institutions as ‘enemies of the people’, ‘saboteurs’, and ‘traitors’. In the words of Bannon, the identitarian toyboy of the billionaire class: ‘Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment’. Alibamazonia Where economist Branko Milanovic foresees a global clash between two ideal type political operating systems in the twenty-first century – liberal capitalism captained by the US, versus political capitalism championed by China – in reality the two have already substantially converged. Reduced to its core, where China and the non-western world opened up economically in the image of the US and the west in the closing decades of the twentieth century, today you can tentatively argue that the US and the wider west are politically closing up in the image of China. The new synthesis is neo-illiberalism, which speaks to what Thomas Piketty views as ‘merchant nativism’ i.e. the marriage between neoliberalism and identitarian nationalism. Besides emphasizing a process of reglobalization rather than deglobalization, the rise of neo-illiberalism also suggests that the center of capitalist gravity has shifted: where parts of the traditional periphery have steadily assumed characteristics of traditional core countries, the west has witnessed a reverse process of what the late Immanuel Wallerstein calls semi-peripheralization. In the words of Martin Wolf: ‘as western economies have become more Latin American in their distribution of incomes, their politics have also become more Latin American’. Where historian Neill Ferguson once spoke of ‘Chimerica’ to emphasize the co-dependent relationship between the world’s two superpowers, today we can identify the contours of what you might call 'Alibamazonia': a twenty-first century imperial federation of techno-nationalist states, i.e. a global alliance between nationalist ‘strongmen’ and digital platforms. The relationship is symbiotic, as the rollout of digital surveillance requires the rollback of liberal democracy by design, which in turn strengthens illiberal political rule. In the words of Susanna Zuboff: ‘surveillance capitalism takes an even more expansive turn toward domination than its neoliberal source code would predict … Though still sounding like Hayek, and even Smith, its antidemocratic collectivist ambitions reveal it as an insatiable child devouring its aging fathers’. Indeed, digitization and surveillance not only disrupt Smithian competitive markets, but also Lockean notions of private property, and ultimately threaten to undo all liberal guarantees of individual freedom. Besides heralding a territorial shift from west to east, amongst others symbolized by the United Nations’ (UN) recent contract with China’s WeChat (Tencent) to streamline its digital communication, neo-illiberalism also heralds a fundamental reconstitution between national and global scales, respectively understood as public and private spaces, whereby decades of neoliberalization transformed the former in the image of the latter, whilst the latter has witnessed an extraterritorial shift into digital and offshore domains, giving rise to private capitalist power of vast proportions, eating away at national states and international state systems. This is the most banal explanation for the western rise of neo-illiberalism: where decades of neoliberalism effectively put up the west for sale, neo-illiberalism heralds the moment when neoliberalism’s ultimate winners seek to buy up and privatize government itself: ‘neoliberalism’s final frontier’. Pandemic Although coronavirus might be the final death knell to neoliberalism, it should be remembered that neoliberalism is a highly mutable ideology – well equipped to utilize its own failure for its advancement. Put differently, if neoliberalism is dying, we are looking at a slow-motion demise: where some identified its imminent death after the dotcom crash at the turn of the millennium, neoliberalism certainly lost its self-explanatory aura after the financial crisis of 2008. Accordingly, although still carried forward by a centrist consensus, western neoliberalism became more authoritarian. And where 2016 saw the centrist consensus collapse, seeing neoliberalism’s core economic project carried on by a decisive illiberal politics, the question is whether today’s coronavirus will bring an end to the economic project. For example, the key pillars of that project, such as global capital mobility and central bank independence, are still standing. Furthermore, although non-neoliberal policies might well be enacted to stem the virus, like introducing capital controls, these might be temporary measures to save the project in the long run. That said, if coronavirus proves to be the final death knell to neoliberalism, which even the Financial Times alludes to, it still might prove a blessing for core features of neo-illiberalism. For example, where the virus is regarded as an indictment of neoliberal globalization, it nonetheless fuels the rollback of liberal democracy and rollout of digital surveillance. Indeed, for the world’s faux Leninists and tech billionaires the virus is the ultimate disruptive event to be exploited. Where the US Republicans have used the pandemic to legislate neoliberal tax breaks and deregulation, as part of a rescue package that trumps the 2008 financial bailout, we should not underestimate the extent to which Trump might exploit the pandemic for his own benefit, not least to escape the prospect of electoral loss and prosecution. Many ‘strongmen’ are embracing the virus to anchor their rule, not least Victor Orbán cynically exploiting the virus to accelerate Hungary’s transformation from liberal democracy towards illiberal dictatorship, with the EU once again looking the other way, thereby confirming its own neo-illiberal corrosion. Where many countries have yet to setup mass testing capabilities to track the virus and create viable paths out of societal lockdowns, a whole range of states have watered down privacy legislation to digitally track the virus, including left coalition governments like Spain. In this sense, the virus has led to a reboot of neoliberalism’s famous TINA mantra – there is no alternative – because who cares about far-reaching surveillance when lives are at stake? As argued by Jamie Bartlett, ‘the looming dystopia to fear is a shell democracy run by smart machines and a new elite of ‘progressive’ but authoritarian technocrats’. Mimicking core features of China’s fin-tech-state integration, Apple and Google have joined forces to allow governments to track the virus, whereas the US government has promised to rollout a digital dollar and wallet as part of its coronavirus rescue package. Indeed, the virus is a financial bonanza for tech companies, not least Thiel’s Palantir having signed a contract with the British National Health Service (NHS) to optimize data management. In one of his first acts to tackle the virus, Dominic Cummings invited all bigtechs to Downing Street. As noted in Wired magazine: ‘for Cummings it's big tech versus bad virus’. Palantir is currently in talks with governments across Europe. Across the globe, the virus is spurring the development of digital apps, using locational data and facial recognition technologies to track population health and whereabouts. In India, Modi’s henchmen are forcing citizens to take hourly selfies to track the virus through their whereabouts, and non-compliance will result in enforced mass quarantine, where catching the virus seems all but certain. In so doing, coronavirus threatens to deepen the ugly face of neo-illiberalism, defined by mass incarceration programs, from Uighurs in China’s Xijiang to refugees indefinitely locked up along the Mediterranean and the US-Mexican border. And whilst the pandemic has yet to reach the world’s favelas and slums, threatening the lives of the most vulnerable, lax responses to the virus in the developed world characterized by defunded health care systems are making neoliberalism’s implicit social Darwinist inclinations shockingly explicit. As the rise of neo-illiberalism signals profound geopolitical and economic shifts, the pandemic might well be utilized to rewire the world’s legacy operating systems. Are we moving towards a financial reset, which was due in 2008 but was postponed via monetary gymnastics? Will China liquidate its massive holding of US treasuries? Will the world’s superpowers ramp up the threat of war or will they compromise, or are we already looking at the contours of a new settlement? Furthermore, with the world economy falling off a cliff, and the worst still to come, many small-and-medium-sized enterprises are facing bankruptcy, whilst Amazon and a handful other bigtechs are massively expanding their businesses. What will the post-corona world look like? Will capitalism survive? While we anticipate what might be coming, one of the biggest societal disruptions is the loss of conventional social exchange, of physical closeness and contact, as we are all locked up in our homes, forcing into digital interfaces, continuously leaking data into the expanding machine of surveillance capitalism. Although there momentarily is no alternative, we’d better make sure we seize the moment: the disruptive virus offers an incredible prospect for societal reprogramming, for better and for worse. Lest we forget that this crisis is not merely biological – it is deeply political. ",2020-05-10

According to the plan, each toman will be worth 10,000 rials.The redenomination plan effectively removes four place values (four zeros) from the Iranian national currency as part of efforts to kickstart an economic recovery from the country. It is a move that echoes steps taken by other countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe amid huge inflation.With the United States exiting its nuclear deal with Iran and reintroducing sanctions, the country’s economic situation has been in a tailspin. Virtually frozen from the international scene, Iran has been facing a severe liquidity crunch and foreign exchange shortage.Typically, people living in countries suffering from an economic crisis turn to cryptocurrency not only as a way of preserving wealth but also as a means of carrying out international transactions. Iran’s case is not dissimilar, with Bitcoin’s (BTC) price even rising to a hefty 300% premium on peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins.Iran’s struggle with hyperinflationIn May 2018, U.S President Donald Trump exited the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal — and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. This decision put enormous pressure on the country’s already fragile economic situation. Commenting on the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran, Babak Behboudi, the CEO of blockchain innovation firm Synchronium remarked:“The U.S. sanctions are the major problem facing the Iranian economy in recent years, which have paralyzed a significant part of the economy. In an economy like Iran, where a significant part of the economy is still state-owned, such sanctions prevent economic stability and growth.”While the deal was in place, Iran’s economy was open to the international scene, benefitting especially from increased oil exports. Indeed, the country’s president, Hassan Rouhani, ran his 2017 election campaign based on programs that would leverage the opportunities afforded by the accord with the U.S.However, the rial was evidently deteriorating even before the U.S. repudiated the nuclear deal, with the country’s inflation rate more than tripling between 2017 and 2018. Indeed, the lifting of sanctions in 2016 did little to spur any growth in real gross domestic product. Between 2017 and 2018, protests broke out in many Iranian cities with people voicing their dissatisfaction over the rising cost of living among other grievances. By August 2018, Iran’s rial had lost more than 80% of its value in barely a year.Faced with a rapidly declining economic situation, the central bank began placing restrictions on forex, a move meant to checkmate the foreign exchange black market. The escalating rial devaluation meant the emergence of an expanding bid-ask spread on Nima — the country’s secondary forex market.At the start of May 2020, the bid-ask spread — the difference between the buying and selling rate for forex — stood at about 9,000 rials. Exporters of non-essential goods in Iran use Nima, and the widening bid-ask spread on the market means having to liquidate overseas earnings at a much cheaper rate that, in turn, harms the profitability of such ventures.The existence of a secondary forex market is in part due to the inability of the authorities to create a unified exchange rate. The government’s failure in this regard meant that a greater percentage of forex deals moved to the black market where participants could speculate on the unending volatility of the rial–dollar exchange rate.At the time of writing, while the official government rate is about 42,000 rials to $1, the black market rate is almost four times higher — with $1 selling for 163,500 rials. Indeed, the Nima rate has also begun to approach the black market figures with $1 worth 157,320 rials.Currency redenomination plansIran’s economic situation has also not been helped by the outbreak of COVID-19 with the country’s currency going into a deeper dive since February. The country has been hit hard by the deadly coronavirus with over 6,500 deaths from about 104,000 cases since the first confirmed infection in mid-February. According to an April report from the World Bank due to the dwindling oil revenues, the country’s GDP growth will continue to lag. The report reads:“Persistence of lower oil prices and export volumes (e.g., due to a significant decline in China’s oil demand) would result in a substantially larger overall shock and fiscal deficit in 2020/21.”On Monday, May 4, 2020, Iran’s Parliament authorized the redenomination of the country’s fiat, eliminating four zeros and replacing the rial with the toman. According to the plan, each toman will be equivalent to 10,000 rials. The move, more than a year in the making, began with a draft bill prepared by the governor of the Central Bank of Iran. Opting for a redenomination also marks a departure from the usual approach of Iran devaluing its currency — which happened about 3,500 times since 1971.Some commentators like government spokesperson, Ali Rabiei, have said the move will help to simplify financial transactions in the country. However, critics of the plan believe it does nothing to solve the fundamental issues affecting the economy.Tehran late to the partyIn a conversation with Cointelegraph, Ali Beikverdi, the CEO of crypto exchange deployment service bitHolla, remarked that Iranians have already been redenominating the country’s fiat to suit different purposes. According to Beikverdi: “Currency denomination in any country doesn’t solve any financial or economic issues. The only thing it does is inflation. However, I must say in Iran this has been a matter of debate for quite some time.” Explaining the confusion caused by multiple rial benchmarks in the country, Beikverdi added:“While banknotes use Iranian rial, people already drop one zero and call it toman. So, one toman = 10 rial today. To add more to that confusion, people even drop three more zeros from toman to make the numbers smaller, and that is very confusing if you are not familiar with it. So, the currency denomination has already happened among people for simplicity, and this is nothing new.”With multiple forex benchmarks existing within the country, the government’s redenomination plan might struggle to achieve the desired results especially given the historical precedence surrounding such actions. For Behboudi, it is still too early to determine the effectiveness of the government’s plan, arguing that taking four zeros of a currency will not have much effect in itself:“Such an effort can be a good small step for a serious, wider, and more effective series of reforms, including well-planned privatization of the economy, decreasing the monetary system expenses, and ease of banking operations.”In a conversation with Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for Iran’s Ministry of Finance derided the plan to create a new fiat currency for the country, declaring:“Everybody in the country knows that redenomination has no effect on inflation. Most economists think it is not a sustainable time for redenomination. Due to coronavirus and oil prices, the revenue of the government has fallen sharply, and at the same time, the costs have grown. So, we expect high inflation.”Bitcoin comes onto the sceneAmid the backdrop of the plans to revamp Iran’s currency, Cointelegraph reached out to Areatak, a blockchain solutions provider based in Tehran. Back in May 2019, Cointelegraph reported that Areatak — in partnership with the Informatics and Services Corporation of Iran’s central bank — was developing Borna, a national blockchain project aimed at transforming the country’s banking and financial sector. In a message to Cointelegraph, Areatak CEO Saeed Khoshbakht revealed the latest updates with the project, stating:“Borna infrastructure and platform is passing the first phase of test and it will be ready soon to launch. As mentioned in the whitepaper, Borna can host central bank cryptocurrency, and maybe it is used in this economic evolution. But the decision is for the central bank and ISC.”While the government tries to solve the growing inflation problem, crypto stakeholders in Iran say the situation favors a more broad-based adoption of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, high ranking officials within the country’s government and military have called for the use of digital currencies to evade crippling U.S. sanctions. Commenting on the growing adoption levels of crypto in Iran, Khoshbakht remarked:“If we analyze the adoption of cryptocurrency usage in the world we find two types of countries are in front of the list. Countries with a lack of digital payment systems and countries with high inflation. Because of High inflation in Iran, people don’t trust to national currency and try to buy everything such as real estate, gold, stock, other currencies like the U.S. dollar and cryptocurrency.”Tehran’s stance on crypto mining has noticeably softened with the authorities allowing Bitcoin miners to set up shop in the country. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Iran has issued about 1,000 licenses to crypto miners in the country.Related: Five Countries Where Crypto Regulation Changed the Most in 2019Earlier in May, the country’s Ministry of Industry, Mining and Trade also gave the go-ahead to Turkish crypto mining firm iMiner to establish a 6,000-rig facility in the Semnan province. Iran has also given tax breaks to crypto miners on the condition that they repatriate all foreign earnings. According to Behboudi, crypto is primed for even greater adoption in Iran, adding: “Mining, holding and trading of cryptocurrencies, especially BTC and ETH, is widely adopted in Iran. I’m sure in next months we will see more investment by the public, especially the middle class, in cryptocurrencies like BTC.”For Beikverdi, the economic crisis in the country is only setting the stage for more people to choose cryptocurrencies. “Once you see your currency loses its value more than five times in about two years, as an investor, you seek alternatives as a store of value,” remarked the bitHolla CEO.Indeed, Bitcoin P2P trading data shows significantly higher BTC premiums in Iran since the start of 2020. On LocalBitcoins, Bitcoin has steadily sold for between 300% and 400% of the global average spot price.For example, while Bitcoin traded at around $7,800 in early January, the quoted price for BTC on LocalBitcoins was the equivalent of over $25,000. While BTC recovered from the Black Thursday flash crash of March 12, the cryptocurrency seemingly traded for $21,000 while the global average hovered above $5,200. ",2020-05-10

Binance close my short after I make 7 times my investment. What's going on? Where is my short? The BTC dropped to $8,000. Who pays the difference?But, the closure of the shorts was systematic and the process is called auto-deleveraging.What is auto-deleveraging and how can winning Bitcoin trades get cut short?In the futures market, traders use debt or leverage to trade with larger capital. Binance, as an example, allows a trader to use 125x of their initial capital. If a user has $1,000, the user can trade with up to $125,000.The role of a cryptocurrency exchange is to match orders between buyers and sellers. Hence, if trader A wants to short Bitcoin at $9,500, the role of the exchange is to find trader B that wants to buy BTC at the same price.A problem occurs when the Bitcoin price sees an abrupt increase or decrease in price. More traders rush to short BTC, and as the price declines rapidly, it creates an imbalance in the orderbook.When there is a big orderbook disparity, it can potentially cause a cascade of liquidations and cause the price of Bitcoin to plunge to abnormal prices. Such a price trend was seen on March 12, when the price of BTC crashed to as low as $3,600 on BitMEX.Major Bitcoin futures exchanges like BitMEX and Binance Futures use a system called auto-deleveraging to ensure their orderbook remains balanced. When the insurance fund is not enough to cover for liquidations, then other trades are cut short to cover for the remaining liquidations.Example of an auto-deleverage Bitcoin trade. Source: AthenaBankBinance Futures says:When a trader’s account size goes below 0, the Insurance Fund is used to cover the losses. However, in some exceptionally volatile market environments, the Insurance Fund may be unable to handle the losses, and open positions have to be reduced to cover them.In such a case, highly leveraged trades are likely to have their trades sized down first. Traders that use 75 to 125x are often in the top percentile and are first to have their trades cut in abnormally volatile market conditions.One trader explained:There is a light for the auto deleverage queue on the trading page when you're in a position. Deleverage is used as insurance for long liquidation in this case to help sustain cascading liquidations and resulting in mega dumps. High leveraged trades are usually first.Can cases of auto-deleveraging be lessened?Auto-deleveraging happens quite frequently in the cryptocurrency market because Bitcoin is significantly more volatile than most traditional assets.The tendency of the price of Bitcoin to sway in a direction rapidly within a short period of time makes it challenging for exchanges to maintain balance in the market.Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for a comment but did not receive a response by press time.

His first … [+4621 chars]",Cointelegraph,"“Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains and the Future of the Internet” is filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann’s follow up to his award-winning 2015 documentary “Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It.”His first film looked at the history (and failings) of money and the financial system, and how Bitcoin was poised to revolutionize and solve many of its problems. Now, Cryptopia brings us up to date with the current state of play in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.The documentary is split into three acts.Act I - BitcoinFirst we get an introduction to the fundamentals of Bitcoin, recapping the problems with traditional finance from the earlier film and highlighting Bitcoin’s initial stated purpose as peer-to-peer digital cash.Hoffmann talks about the benefits of Bitcoin with a veritable who’s who of industry figures, from Wences Casares, to Andreas M Antonopoulos and Laura Shin. We also see how and why big banks and governments have kicked back against the top-ranked cryptocurrency.We then move on to Bitcoin’s explosive growth in value since the first film, and repositioning from digital cash to digital gold.Hoffmann revisits Roger Ver, who had previously espoused Bitcoin as a fast and cheap method of moving money around the world, to investigate the block-size debate and eventual fork of Bitcoin Cash.He also speaks to Blockstream’s Samson Mow, for his take on the split, along with Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin.Act II - BlockchainsThe film then moves on to tackle the move from one blockchain to hundreds of blockchains. Hoffmann explains the concept of smart contracts and the Ethereum network, speaking to Vitalik Buterin, Vinny Lingham, and Tone Vays for their opinions, both positive and negative.Hoffmann takes a look at the initial coin offering, or ICO, phenomenon, bringing blockchains and currencies for every conceivable purpose, along with a wave of scams and fraudsters into the space.We see how big business and finance is co-opting blockchain technology, sometimes through the use of private centralized networks. We see the tokenization of traditional securities and totally new forms of assets.Act III - The Future of the InternetThrough looking at the examples of the development of the motor car and the early internet, Hoffmann highlights similarities with today’s blockchain industry.He notes the rise of internet censorship in certain jurisdictions, and discusses the potential of blockchain to overcome this. We also consider the hegemony of tech giants and their control of our information and identities, looking at the possibilities of decentralization to overcome this.To round up, the film considers the possibilities of Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, although notes the controversy created following the DAO hack and subsequent rollback of the Ethereum blockchain.Hoffmann finally talks to Craig Wright (who behaves exactly as expected), touching on the Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin SV split, and finally coming full circle to Satoshi’s disappearance and how this has worked for Bitcoin.ConclusionThe film has been professionally researched, shot, and put together. It assumes no prior knowledge of the subject, and follows a well structured story, making it accessible to all.Hoffmann’s style and delivery works well. He is authoritative yet friendly and open, being unafraid to challenge or poke fun at characters like Craig Wright, while always being even-handed and letting people speak.Sure, for those who are already invested in the industry and technology, there is little new to learn here, but for the uninitiated it is an excellent primer into a world that they may have heard about, but not really understand.For me personally, both this film and Hoffmann’s previous documentary made me incredibly proud to be part of this movement that is literally changing the world.My only criticism (and it is a minor one) is the song which plays out over the credits. Penned by Hoffmann himself and Malaysian singer, Prema Yin, it is a powerful, soulful number, rousing the spirits… until you listen more closely and realise that it is about cryptocurrency.To be fair, it is probably the least cringe-inducing cryptocurrency-related song that I’ve ever happened across, with intelligent lyrics and a proper decent tune. However this is a bit like being the least cancerous case of sunburn; the end consequence still consists of a pair of bright red cheeks.Sorry, and maybe this is just me, but the worlds of cryptocurrency and music (both of which I love individually) should never cross paths.However, I have no hesitation in recommending this film, which is available to stream now at cryptopiafilm.com for a price of just under 9 Australian dollars ($5.88)... and you can always make a cup of tea when it gets to the credits.

This event has recently ignited strong market interest where Bitcoin broke through $10,000 on May 8, 2020, fully recovering from the Black Thursday crash. Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market cap has also passed $270 billion. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is currently hovering around $10,000.On-chain market activities have turned positive and have taken a u-turn after Black ThursdayAs of May 8, 2020, the Bitcoin network hash rate has reached an all-time high, and the difficulty level rose to 16.10T. The newly added and active addresses rose 22.52% and 13.03%, respectively, from the seven-day average, of which the number of active addresses reached nearly a million addresses.The current number of active addresses for the Bitcoin network has reached a local high — second only to the number of active addresses during the end of the bull market between the 2017 year-end and the beginning of 2018 — and is quickly approaching the same level in mid-2019 when the price was at $13,000.Google Trends reflects high popularity for Bitcoin halvingThe current search interest for the keywords “Bitcoin halving” has reached a peak of 100 in the first week of May 2020 and has exceeded its second halving, which happened in July 2016, by more than four times. Market participants are curious to discover how the market dynamic could change post-halving.Meanwhile, Europe has been the most enthusiastic region about the Bitcoin halving. Among the top 10 regions in the past 30 days for search interest, Malta is the highest, followed by Saint Helena and Luxembourg. These regions have positive regulatory frameworks to support the cryptocurrency industry. Among them, Malta holds the most active regulatory attitude toward cryptocurrencies and recognizes the legal status of cryptocurrency in its region.Surprisingly, in the past month, Africa has had an unusual attitude toward the Bitcoin halving with Nigeria ranking fourth in search interest and South Africa ranking seventh.Bitcoin Mayer Multiple reflects positive sentimentsBitcoin Mayer Multiple is a price analysis indicator created by Trace Mayer as a method to measure Bitcoin’s current price and the long-term historical price trend.A Mayer Multiple lower than 1 means that the current Bitcoin price is below the 200-day moving average and that the market sentiment is negative, with a downward trend. Conversely, when the Mayer Multiple is greater than 1, the current market sentiment is generally optimistic and supports BTC’s upward price trend.Bitcoin’s Mayer Multiple fell to 0.574 after the Black Thursday market plunge and was in an extreme panic stage. It has since recovered and continued to rise above 1. The market’s expectations for the Bitcoin halving have begun to materialize, and fear of missing out, or FOMO, has started to spread in the market.Miners’ Position Index and Miners’ Rolling Inventory indicate that miners are expecting positive market dynamic post-halvingMiners’ Position Index, or MPI, is a measurement to understand the current behavior of miners. An MPI value above 2 is essentially a longer-term, macrostructure analysis where, in a shorter term, a value above 0 might indicate local selling opportunities, and when the values go into extreme negatives, this might indicate local buying opportunities (when miners are holding Bitcoin).It is interesting to see that when analyzing from a macro view, the MPI values have been consistently below 2 since the 2017 bull runs. From the micro trend perspective, the values are generally below 0, indicating miners are more inclined to hold Bitcoin. There was only a brief period between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 when the MPI values reached above 0, possibly due to some miners capitulating.The Miner’s Rolling Inventory, or MRI, is mainly used to measure the changes in the level of Bitcoin inventories held by miners.As of May 8, 2020, the MRI for one day, one week, five weeks and 12 weeks have generally returned to around 1.Miners were generally holding Bitcoin from January to March 2020. Immediately before Black Thursday, miners were comfortable selling into a strong market bid represented by the value of 1.63 on March 11, 2020, which is significantly greater than 1. However, post-market crash miners have been leaning toward holding back.The MPI and MRI provide unique perspectives from miners using different approaches. Although the interpretations of these two metrics are different, they both point toward the same behavior of the miners who generally lean toward holding Bitcoin pre-halving.Opportunities facing global market uncertaintiesIn the long run, Bitcoin presents itself with significant innovations to the world, generating disruptive ideas, market interests and opportunities for many to tap into. In the long run, we expect that the halving, coupled with the gradual maturity of the industry, will continue to gain traction globally.However, the direction of the cryptocurrency market can also be easily influenced by many market factors. As we are heading toward the third post-halving in the Bitcoin era, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the direction of the traditional financial market are still unclear. These uncertainties can potentially translate to the cryptocurrency market, creating a ripple effect that generates significant volatility in the short term.This article was co-authored by Johnson Xu and Fanger Chou.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Johnson Xu is a devoted fintech professional with a background in finance and computer science and with substantial exposure to the cryptocurrency/blockchain industry.

This capitulatory decline came close on the heels of the intense uptrend seen throughout the past several days and weeks. Investors and traders alike were largely caught off guard by this latest movement, as it came during a time in which BTC was flashing some immense signs of bullishness.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609691 = window.pid609691 || rnd;                 var plc609691 = window.plc609691 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609691;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609691 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609691++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc367529 = window.plc367529 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc367529:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_367529_' + plc367529;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 367529,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_367529_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc367529++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  In the near-term, it now appears that Bitcoin could be well positioned to see a sharp recovery back into the $9,000 region.

Image Courtesy of Galaxy BTC’s Next Major Resistance Sits Within Mid-$9,000 Region  A byproduct of this latest decline is that the mid-$9,000 region has now become heavy resistance – meaning that a test of this level may be imminent. Another popular trader spoke about this, explaining that how Bitcoin responds to this region will be of the utmost importance. He also notes that a firm move past this resistance could be enough to propel Bitcoin far beyond $10,500. “This is why 9450-9500 is going to be super important post-halving on Tuesday. There will be a lot of sell pressure coming in from everyone who’s been shafted after longing the breakout &gt; retest. Overcome that and I think 10550 and higher is on the cards.” Image Courtesy of Nik patel Featured image from Unplash.  ",2020-05-10

However, the prevailing conditions in the industry are far better than the conventional global financial markets. While the entire world stares at an inevitable recession in the coming days, many investors have started investing in some of the leading digital currencies as a measure to minimize the impact on their finances. These decisions are based on the fact that Bitcoin and a significant number of altcoins exhibited a limited direct correlation with the traditional market instruments. Meaning, as the value of stocks continues to plummet, cryptocurrencies have held their ground registering a small percentage fall in their valuation.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  Meanwhile, the crypto trading community hasn’t lost its hopes either, as one thing that has remained constant during these trying times is the volatile nature of these digital assets. As the interest in investing and trading in cryptocurrencies continues to increase, so does the search for the right platform that can satisfy all their trading requirements. Changing Traffic Patterns on Crypto Platforms A recent analysis of web traffic data shared by ICO Analytics shows that the number of users on a handful of crypto platforms has increased while the rest of them registered a decline.

These three platforms include OKEx, CoinsBit, and ZBcom with 147%, 33% and 18% respectively. On the other hand, the highest drop in web traffic in the month of April as compared to March 2020 was experienced by BitMEX at 40%. The web traffic trend favoring just 3 out of 20 exchanges may indicate that new traders are perceiving these 3 exchanges to be more reliable, trustworthy, and maybe even easier to access compared to others. Another possibility involves some of the existing traders favoring them over the rest due to favorable trading terms, supported assets, or a lot of other reasons.

This indicates that the sentiment is to continue buying on the dips.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360When Bitcoin plummets, it drags most cryptocurrencies along with it, but it is also important to remember that several major cryptocurrencies have been in an uptrend for the past few weeks.Corrections in an uptrend offer a buying opportunity to the traders who had missed the bus earlier. With the Bitcoin halving less than two days away, volatility is likely to remain high. Therefore, in the next few days, traders might consider reducing their position size to keep their risk under control.Let’s see which five major cryptocurrencies offer attractive trading opportunities in the short-term.BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC) broke above $9,200 on May 7 and hit a high of $10,058.52 on the same day. However, the $10,000 level proved to be a tough hurdle to cross.BTC-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewAfter a minor correction on May 8 and 9, the BTC/USD pair plummeted on Saturday evening. The failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the previous resistance turned support at $9,200 could have led to selling by the bulls and initiation of short positions by the bears.The pair is currently trading inside an ascending channel where the price moves between the support line and the resistance line of the channel.$10,000 was close to the resistance line of the channel and from there the pair fell to $8,130.58, which is just above the support line of the channel. The strong bounce off this level, as seen from a long tail on the downside, is a positive sign.This suggests that the bulls did not panic but used the drop to the support line of the channel to buy. As long as the price remains inside the channel, the trend remains up and strong declines to the support line of the channel can be purchased.The first sign of weakness will be a drop below the channel. If that happens, long positions should be avoided until a new buy setup forms once again.BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour chart shows that the price dropped sharply within a short time frame (shown via the blue arrow on the chart). If the traders watch the 30-minute chart, they can see that the pair dropped from $9,566.52 to $8,130.58 within 30 minutes. Such a fall usually suggests liquidation by a large player.However, a positive is that the price recovered sharply from $8,130.58 and since then has been trading above the $8,500 levels. The recovery might face stiff resistance between $8,960.97 and $9,156.94, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of this leg of the fall.If the pair bounces off $8,500, it could be a good entry point for the traders with a stop-loss placed just below the channel. The target objective on the upside is $9,600 and then $10,000.Conversely, if the next drop breaks below $8,500, traders can wait for the price to bounce off the support line of the channel, which can offer another buying opportunity with stops placed just below the channel.If the bears sink the price below the channel, it will be a huge negative as it will signal a possible change in trend. Therefore, bottom fishing should be avoided if the pair sustains below the channel.ETH/USDAlthough Ether (ETH) broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel on April 29 and 30, the bulls failed to sustain the higher levels. That resulted in a correction, which found support at the 20-day simple moving average ($204) on May 7.ETH-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewHowever, today, the 2nd-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turned down sharply and plunged below both moving averages and the support line of the ascending channel.Due to this, the 10-day exponential moving average ($203) has turned down marginally and the relative strength index has slipped into the negative territory. This suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback. The price should sustain below the channel to confirm a change in trend.Currently, the price has bounced off the support line of the ascending channel, which is a positive sign. This suggests that the bulls view the dips as a buying opportunity. The pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above the downtrend line.ETH-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe ETH/USD pair is attempting to reverse direction from the support line of the ascending channel. However, the bears are defending the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the decline, which is at $193.946.If the price turns down and plummets below $181.40, it will signal weakness and could result in a decline to $167 and below it to $150. Therefore, traders can initiate short positions below $181 with stops placed just above $194.Conversely, if the price turns up from the support line of the channel, it will signal buying on dips. Therefore, the bulls can buy the bounce off the channel with the stops placed at $181. If the bulls push the price above $197.821-$201.696 resistance, a rally to the downtrend line is possible.As the markets are volatile, traders should keep trailing their stops higher to reduce their risk.XTZ/USDTezos (XTZ) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows that the trend is up. However, the bears have been aggressively defending the $3 levels for the past few days. Although the bulls broke above this level on April 29 and 30, they could not build up on the breakout.XTZ-USD daily chart.

The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively. If the price bounces off the zone, it could offer a buying opportunity to the traders.The stops for this trade can be kept just below $2.20. On the upside, a rally to $2.70 and then to $3 is possible. The traders can trail the stops higher as the price moves up.This bullish view will be invalidated if the next dip breaks below the support line of the channel and sustains below $2.240. If this level cracks, long positions can be avoided until a new buy setup forms.ADA/USDCardano (ADA) has been facing stiff resistance at the overhead resistance at $0.0522712 while the bulls have been buying the dips to the support at $0.0468137. This tight range trading suggests a balance between buyers and sellers.ADA-USD daily chart.

Below this level, a retest of $0.0427299 is possible. If this support also cracks, a deeper correction will be on the cards.ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour of the ADA/USD pair shows that the price is stuck in a $0.0543484-$0.0461143 range.

This resulted in a sharp pullback, which shows strong buying on dips.However, the recovery is facing resistance in the $0.0477515-$0.0489368 zone, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent fall.If the bulls buy the next fall to the $0.0468137-$0.0461143 support zone, it will indicate demand at lower levels. Therefore, traders can buy the bounce off this zone with a target objective of $0.053.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $0.0461143. If that happens, a deeper fall is likely, hence, traders can avoid bottom fishing below this level until a new buy setup forms.NEO/USDNEO has been trading inside the ascending channel for the past few weeks. Though the bulls broke above the resistance line of the channel on May 8, they could not sustain the breakout.NEO-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewAs a result, the 20th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap again dipped back into the channel. However, with both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls.Today, the bulls purchased the dip to the 10-day EMA ($9.8), which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper fall to enter long positions. The trend will remain positive as long as the price remains inside the channel.The first sign of weakness will be if the bears sink the price into the bottom half of the channel. A break below the support line of the channel will signal a change in trend.NEO-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour chart shows that the failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the resistance line of the channel attracted profit booking. That dragged the price to just below the centerline of the channel.However, strong buying close to $9.64 levels has pushed the NEO/USD pair back into the top half of the channel. This is a positive sign. If the bulls can scale the price above $10.50, a rally to the resistance line of the channel at $11.30 is possible Therefore, traders can buy at $10.50 with a stop-loss below $9.60.On the other hand, if the pair dips below $9.63378, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A bounce of this level can also offer a low-risk buying opportunity.In this case, the stop-loss can be kept just below the channel because if the price sustains below the channel, a deeper correction is likely.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The first halving took place in 2012; the second halving took place in 2016. Now, the third halving is expected, and like the previous ones, it will halve the reward for the calculated Bitcoin block. Originally, the reward for the calculated block was 50 BTC. Since then, the reward has been reduced to 25 and 12.5 BTC — and is about to be reduced to 6.75 BTC.The upcoming halving, however, differs from previous halvings in that much more people are involved in the crypto industry. New opportunities have emerged, including ones for big players to manipulate the price of Bitcoin. Among the financial instruments available to large players, there are also stock options and futures on Bitcoin. There has also been a significant increase in people’s awareness of what cryptocurrencies are. Even those who used to be far away from digital currency have learned about what is expected in the Bitcoin network.In the long term, an event such as the halving will only affect the price of a digital currency by increasing its hash rate. The hash rate and Bitcoin prices have a correlation between each other. The higher the hash rate, the harder it is to calculate new blocks and the less Bitcoin enters the market. On the contrary, a decrease in the hash rate is beneficial for miners, as it allows them to earn more BTC. Although they perform one task, all miners compete with one another.In the short term, the network hash rate will decrease. This is due to the disconnection of old equipment by the miners, which, at current electricity prices, will no longer be able to operate profitably. This has already happened in the first and second halving of the Bitcoin network. At first, the BTC hash rate, together with the BTC rate, decreased and then increased significantly. As we have already seen from previous halvings, a noticeable bullish movement started about a year after the event and lasted several months.The year is about the period of time that miners need for technical re-equipment. By purchasing new, more powerful equipment, Bitcoin miners significantly improve the network together. The offer of new BTCs on the market is simultaneously reduced with the growth of the hash rate. Seeing the beginning of growth, the miners begin to hold on to the digital currency in order to part with it at the highest possible price. This is how the peaks in the Bitcoin price chart occur.The expected halving has a psychological aspect as well. Since the markets of cryptocurrencies and traditional markets have correlated with each other, the fall of the markets due to the coronavirus pandemic has also led to the fall of all digital currencies. However, Bitcoin has shown better recovery dynamics than S&amp;P 500, SSE Index, Nikkei and even gold. Coronavirus topics continue to be at the top of news publications. Because of this, an event like the halving, at first, partly went into the shadows and now is attracting more and more interest. Google Trends indicates that people actively look for information about what the Bitcoin halving is. The event for the network is undoubtedly positive, and if not today, it will promote purchases in the foreseeable future.There are increasing signs that Bitcoin is being chosen as an alternative to fiat currencies. Thus, research at Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust and other analysts have said that new investors have not even heard about the Bitcoin halving. Their concerns are quite different: what the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said about money as “unlimited pot,” and how President Donald Trump promises to print trillions of dollars to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. More financial institutions have been investing in digital currency. Grayscale, which manages the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, reported that 88% of investments in Q1 2020 were from institutional investors. In terms of technical analysis, Bitcoin is also doing well: Three key resistance levels have been already surpassed simultaneously — the 200-day simple moving average, the 200-day exponential moving average, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. A fixation above the $10,500 level may mean the beginning of a bullish trend right now.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Anna Tutova is the CEO of Coinstelegram, a crypto-consulting agency.

The programmed supply reduction could potentially bring a supply shock and large price implications. Once every four years something happens to bitcoin that slashes the supply growth rate in half. Bitcoin halving, as it's called, is set to take place for the third time on or around May 12. In the past, this event has coincided with a strong run-up in the bitcoin price and may lead to pre- and post-halving volatility, with price implications extending into 2020 and beyond. The 2020 halving event has several additional factors than previous such events including the availability of CME Bitcoin futures and options, which investors and miners can use to hedge or express views on the bitcoin price. This changes the narrative around the halving for three key reasons: it enables price risks to be hedged, demand risk for bitcoin can be managed and speculators can look to the indicators of options pricing. Miner Incentives New units of bitcoin are created through mining. Mining is the process of confirming transactions, combining them into blocks and adding them to the blockchain. As a reward, and to keep miners incentivized, every time a block is completed, the miner responsible for creating that block receives a reward in the form of new bitcoin. Miners compete with each other to earn newly-issued tokens known as the block reward. The bitcoin protocol was programmed with several rules; a cap on the total supply of bitcoin of 21 million and a planned reduction in the block rewards miners receive. Currently a new block of bitcoin transactions is solved by miners and added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes. Halvings happen once every four years - or more precisely, at every 210,000 blocks of transactions. The next one will happen at block 630,000; on or around May 12, 2020. With this program of diminishing returns, miners reap fewer bitcoins with each halving. Initially, in 2009, winning miners were rewarded with 50 bitcoin per block. That halved in November 2012 to 25, and again in July 2016 to 12.5 bitcoin per block. The third halving will see the network incentives or block rewards fall to 6.25 bitcoin. In notional terms, given the bitcoin price of approximately $8,750 as of May 1, 2020, miners receive ~$110,000K for their 12.5 BTC. After the next halving, assuming the same price level, they will instead earn ~$55,000 giving them less of an incentive to mine blocks. What Can We Expect for the Price of Bitcoin? In normal markets, lower supply with steady demand usually leads to higher prices. With bitcoin supply reduced, halving has the potential to push the price up, theoretically to double the pre-halving level. This hasn't happened in the past due to the preemptive run-up to the halving event; however, it has usually preceded some of bitcoin's largest runs. In previous years, the price of bitcoin started rallying 12 months ahead of the reward halving and continued for some time after.  Source: Coinmetrics A year before the first halving, bitcoin was trading around $2.50. By the time of the halving event, it had hit $12.60. Over the course of the following year, the price rose to $1,007 before falling away. A similar pattern played out in July 2016 when bitcoin was gaining greater mainstream recognition and coincided with the first boom in initial coin offerings. One year prior to the event, bitcoin was trading at $270. Twelve months after, it was at $2,500. Will 2020 Be Different? So far, bitcoin's third halving looks different to prior events, and there doesn't appear to have been such a sustained price run-up. Given the reward change has been known since bitcoin's inception in 2009, and having already seen two such events, investors may have already incorporated the supply adjustment into their models and taken positions accordingly. The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in lower volumes as some participants focused on larger adjacent non-crypto markets and some mining operations being impacted by these difficult market conditions. Previously, miners typically sold their bitcoin for fiat currency as they earned it to pay for operational costs. Mining is now dominated by professional mining companies seeking a profit. With lower rewards they may decide to hold onto their bitcoin until a new price forms that compensates them for their expenses. The halving could force a shakeup of the mining landscape. The Evolution of a Derivatives Market For the first time there is a robust derivatives market for bitcoin in both futures and options. In previous halvings, market participants could only express their views on bitcoin through the spot market. This time around, firms looking to hedge or speculate have the ability to trade a derivate rather than the underlying and so they can express both positive and negative views on bitcoin's price action. At the time of the last halving, miners could either hold on to their block rewards or they could sell them in the spot market to pay for operating costs. This constant selling meant that price appreciation was measured. After a halving event, as miners would have fewer bitcoins to sell, there would be less selling pressure, meaning the price would go up. Now, with a liquid derivatives market, it is possible to hedge and lock in future bitcoin prices in order to cover expenses without selling bitcoin. If this is the case, then selling pressure from miners is less likely to act as a drag on bitcoin prices going forward. A robust options market could also allow for additional income to be earned by miners or enhance long bitcoin positions which would further cushion the impact of the upcoming halving. With the emergence of a healthy options market, investors can take price signals and consensus estimates about market expectations. The Final Countdown There are multiple reasons why market participants would want a futures contract when the block reward will occur to help manage potential price volatility. The halving does not change the specifications of the CME contract. Bitcoin futures contracts continue to represent 5 bitcoin. Contracts are listed for six consecutive months, as well as two December contracts, meaning that participants can manage their risk from May/June 2020 out to December 2021. Growing institutional participation saw open interest rise to $407 million - a record 8,706 contracts on May 6. Year to date average daily volumes in CME's BTC futures are 8,399 contracts, up 43% compared to the same period in 2019. Large Open Interest Holders (a LOIH is any entity that holds at least 25 BTC contracts) achieved a record of 62 holders on April 14, indicating a resurgence in institutions that want exposure to the cryptocurrency.  Source: CME Group data Bitcoin markets are bound to change between each successive halving, and the market has matured a great deal since 2016. Whatever happens, the 2020 event will define bitcoin markets for the foreseeable future.

Image Courtesy of Byzantine General ETH’s Rejection at High-Time-Frame Resistance Opens Gates for Serious Downside  Ethereum’s grave underperformance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seems to be the result of a recent rejection it posted at its HTF resistance in the $210-220 region. One prominent pseudonymous trader spoke about this in a recent tweet, explaining that ETH was rejected at this level yesterday before finding some support in the $180 region. “ETH update: As I thought, ETHUSD shorts were safe. BTC took out the highs and ruined plenty of bear dreams, ETH never did and dumped all the same. Today is going to be interesting, ETHUSD technically hit support, lets see if it can close above it,” he said Image Courtesy of DonAlt While looking at the chart he offered, it does appear that the next major support that the crypto has sits around $150.

This capitulatory decline came about shortly after the crypto navigated into the five-figure price region. This volatility was sparked after the crypto posted multiple failed attempts to break into the $10,000 region, signaling that the resistance here may be insurmountable for bulls. This overnight meltdown caused traders on BitMEX to see nearly $300 million in positions liquidated. Open interest on the platform also plummeted, signaling that active traders may become even less involved in the market in the days and weeks ahead.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  Analysts believe that there may be more turbulence ahead for the cryptocurrency, as it could soon see a major decline if it fails to hold above a key support level. Bitcoin Struggles to Recapture Previous Momentum Following Sharp Selloff At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading down nearly 11% at its current price of $8,670. This marks a notable decline from daily highs of just under $10,000 that were set yesterday.

This was the third largest liquidation total seen in the past six months. “$275mln+ of XBTUSD sell liquidations in last twenty-four hours as Coinbase suffers outage,” Skew explained.

Traders May See Further Blood in the Days and Weeks Ahead The trend of active traders being decimated by Bitcoin’s immense volatility may not end anytime soon. One respected trader explained in a recent tweet that he is closely watching to see how BTC responds to a potential visit to $8,400. He notes that this is the level that Bitcoin was trading at just prior to its mid-March meltdown that led it to lows of $3,800. “BTC update: Looks like that retest of 9784 was the perfect short setup, funny how these things play out sometimes. Plan is to wait for the range to form. Areas of interest for me are the POC ~8860 (resistance now) and 8.4 (former support before the 3K nuke),” he explained while pointing to the chart seen below.

We have a positive yield of three or four percent per year.”With the addition of gold, Machinsky stated that that Celsius now provides support for a non-correlated asset that is stable — offering a bridge for users who may not yet be interested in crypto assets but are interested in moving out of fiat currency and non-correlated non-correlated assets.“Most people have close to 100% of their assets denominated in their local currency. So they have real estate, they have bonds, stock, whatever,” he said.“They hold all of those things in one basket, they just don’t realize it's one basket. They have either zero or close to zero uncorrelated assets.”“I think everyone should have two to five percent of their portfolio in [non-correlated assets] as an insurance against debasement,” he added.Celsius to expand commodity offeringsLooking forward, Mashinsky stated that Celsius wants to add support for other tokenized non-correlated assets and commodities.“I really want to add silver, maybe even a few commodities if we can tokenize them and generate yield. We want that unique combination of non-correlation and yield, and I think if we have a broad enough portfolio that is going to enable many more people to join,” he added.“Maybe even older folks may join just because they want gold. They might never touch the Bitcoin side of it, but, if you have all the options, then you really expand the community and all these people are in the digital assets market.”He concluded saying: “Some of them might not even realize that they are in the digital asset market, but I think that is an opportunity for us.” ",2020-05-10

But when it comes to exploring into the tokenized economy they really don’t know much — they are like the blind leading the blind. I learned that very quickly.” “I keep my traditional attorneys on the traditional side and then I hire a few blockchain attorneys who are much younger and very much into tokenized economies — and then I deal with all sides and balance the two,” she added.Ta also noted the difficulties of seeking legal advice on an emerging industry with rapidly changing regulatory guidelines and challenges, stating:“One of the things I learned in this industry is that we need legal experts and attorneys, but we have to also be ahead of them before they can guide us correctly.”“Slowly but surely I believe the industry is going to mature when it comes to regulations — and that is where I believe where adoption is going to grow,” she added.

Interestingly, on-chain data from previous halvings suggests that after the halving Bitcoin price may not see an immediate drop.Google Trends data shows that searches for the halving have already surpassed previous all-time highs, and the crypto community has been issuing a variety of price estimates for the post halving price.Some analysts have pointed to the Efficient Market Hypothesis to support their view that the halving is already priced in, meaning it’s a foreseeable event investors can take into account early. Even a prominent Bitcoin whale who’s known as Joe007 recently argued that the price of Bitcoin would crash after the halving.What does on-chain data show pre-halvingBlockchain data shared by on-chain data analysis firm CryptoQuant shows that miners are not keen on selling their newly minted BTC ahead of the halving. Using the Miners’ Position Index (MPI), CryptoQuant found that over the last three months, miners have been avoiding selling.Miner Position Index. Source: CryptoQuantAn MPI reading above 2 suggests miners are selling their BTC after mining, while a negative value shows they’re avoiding selling as much as possible in favor of accumulation.As shown on the chart above, the MPI was slightly above 0 in December 2019 and it began to drop in January. By February the reading had hit -0.5.Miners do not sell right awayBitcoin miners have historically been a driving force behind Bitcoin’s price as they are the suppliers of new coins in the market. They are also one of the primary groups that create constant sell pressure for BTC as they liquidate newly minted coins to cover their electricity and operating expenses.Thus, miner sentiment is important for the market and something investors keep a close eye on. Back in 2017, when the price of Bitcoin hit a new all-time high near $20,000, the MPI hit a high of 3.9, showing miners sold coins they seemingly deemed overpriced.In the subsequent year-long bear market, the MPI dropped below -1, showing miners avoided selling as much as possible despite the low prices.Data shows that in the first and second halvings, miners did not sell their funds right away. Ahead of the halvings, the MPI was below 0 and as the price increased so did the MPI. When the MPI reading surpassed 2 just a few months after the halving, the price crashed.Furthermore, when the first halving occurred in November 2012, miners rode the bull run until April 2013, then they finally started selling their coins.Mason Yang, CSO at CryptoQuant told Cointelegraph:After the two previous halvings, the Bitcoin price did not skyrocket immediately after the halving. The Bitcoin price had risen over several months. If traders want to avoid trading risks, the most important thing is monitoring whether whales and miners are cashing out rather than expecting short-term price changes.MPI shifts during previous Bitcoin halvings. Source: CryptoQuantBitcoin miners’ role is expected to decrease in in 2020The cryptocurrency space has evolved significantly since the last halving in 2016. Data from cryptocurrency data provider CryptoCompare shows that throughout 2020 daily trading volumes have consistently been at least 10 times larger than those in 2016.In 2016 Bitcoin volumes on spot exchanges rarely exceeded $1 billion a day, while they now consistently surpass $10 billion a day. Readers will also note that April 30 saw record-breaking volumes leading to the Bitcoin halving.Total Spot Volume. Source: CryptoCompareCrypto derivatives markets have also grown significantly, with Binance, Huobi, OKEx, and BitMEX trading well over $50 billion each throughout April. This suggests that Bitcoin miners are now smaller players in the space, although they are still responsible for creating constant sell pressure in the Bitcoin price.Recently Blockware Solutions CEO Matt D’souza told Cointelegraph:I think we may get a bit of the buy the rumor, sell the news. In 2016 we had a significant 80% run-up before halving and that got sold into halving and the day of halving we sold off further. We bottomed 3 weeks beyond halving and began an amazing bull run. This time we haven’t had the run-up but we’re getting some buy-side demand presently. I think it gets sold right into or after halving, but I also think that the selloff will be smaller and shallower as we didn’t have the run-up.Miner selling pressure, as such, may not be expected to have such a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin right after the halving this year.Obviously, past performance is no guarantee of future results but it is worth considering given that miners are minting 1,800 BTC (nearly $18 million) per day.Exchange inflows provide valuable insightCryptocurrency exchange inflows may be a better indicator of what is going to happen at the time of the halving. These precede significant price rises and sharp drops, as miners and whales move their coins to trading platforms before shifts in price occur.As shown by the exchange inflow chart below, there was a surge before and during the March 13 market crash to $3,750.Total BTC inflow to all exchange wallets. Source: CryptoQuantAfter the Black Thursday crash, inflows have remained relatively low as whales and miners were not moving coins from their wallets to trading platforms. This suggests that they may be looking for the price to perform as it did during the last two halving events.Whatever the short-term price action is after the halving, many are bullish about the event, especially in the long-run. According to D'souza:Overall, it seems we’re transitioning into a bull market. The fundamentals have never been better for Bitcoin and funds, retail, hodlers are deploying capital towards Bitcoin which counterbalances sell pressure. ",2020-05-10

A transfer involves the movement of assets, monetary funds, or ownership rights from one account to another. A transfer may require an exchange of funds when it involves a change in ownership, such as when an investor sells a real estate holding. In this case, there is a transfer of title from the seller to the buyer and a simultaneous transfer of funds, equal to the negotiated price, from the buyer to the seller.    The term transfer may also refer to the movement of an account from one bank or brokerage to another.      Key Takeaways  A transfer is the movement of assets, funds, or ownership rights from one place to another.A transfer is also used to describe the process by which ownership of funds or assets is reassigned to a new owner.Banking, brokerage, cryptocurrency, asset titles, and loan transfers are a few examples of domains and transaction types where transfers occur.      Types of Transfers    A transfer is a term that has a broad connotation among various industries and transaction types. Below are a few examples of how a transfer is triggered for an individual, group, or company.    In all cases, a transfer involves the movement of funds or assets and the possibility of assigning new ownership.     Bank Transfers    When an account holder moves funds from one account to another, say from a checking account to a savings account with a higher interest rate, or from savings to an IRA account, a transfer has occurred. The transfer does not have to be within the same bank. It can be an interbank transfer from one account held at Bank A to another held at Bank B.    Within the banking industry, funds can also be transferred cross-border through wire transfers from a domestic account to a foreign account, and vice versa. The receiving accounts could be held by the same account holder or could be owned by a different person or company.    Funds are normally transferred for purposes of financial planning, to take advantage of better investment rates, to make payments for goods or services, to bring up the required balance of another account, to gift someone or an organization, or to save money, among other reasons.     Brokerage Transfers    Investors normally transfer funds and assets from within or outside their brokerage accounts. An investor who needs to fund his investment account so that he can purchase more shares may choose to make the transfer from another investment account held with the same broker or held with another broker.    Most assets like company stock, bonds, certificates of deposit (CDs), mutual funds, etc. can be transferred in-kind from one investment account to another. These assets can also be transferred to another person or charitable organization as gifts. Money transfers can also be made from an investor's bank account to his brokerage account, and vice versa.     Payments and Cryptocurrency    In the payment space, a transfer involves moving money from one account to another. Internal transfers may include moving money from one account to another owned by the same individual or organization. Transfers between people include wires, but also e-payments like PayPal and Venmo.    In the crypto-economy, funds and cryptocurrencies are transferred frequently between users to public addresses where the funds can be accessed with a private key unique to each user. When goods and services are traded, the buyer would transfer, say bitcoins, from his holdings to the seller’s digital address. This is similar to any other market, whether brick-and-mortar or e-commerce, where transfers between sellers and buyers are what defines a market.    Cryptocurrencies can also be transferred from one cryptocurrency exchange to another exchange where they are deposited in an account also held by the sender or someone else that the seller is gifting or transacting with. Also, trading cryptos for fiat money also initiates some sort of transfer where the user can transfer money from his bank account to the exchange and buy coins with the funds.     Asset Title Transfers    Titles on assets like cars, land, and homes can be transferred when sold or gifted to an individual or corporation. When a homeowner sells his home to another, he needs to fill out the quitclaim deed or any other forms needed to transfer the title of ownership. A landowner can transfer his title to anyone or any corporation if he wants to. Ownership transfer can come about due to selling the land, gifting it, willing the title to a beneficiary, following a court order, or foreclosure from bankruptcy.    Even the ownership of a phone can be transferred if the mobile carrier permits it. In this case, the mobile phone, phone number, and the contract can be transferred to another entity that would take ownership of it and accept the legal responsibility of fulfilling the bill payments as they come due.     Loan Transfer    Loans can also be transferrable. For example, a homeowner with an assumable loan can transfer the mortgage to someone else like the buyer if s/he qualifies for the loan. This could be a win-win solution for both parties involved in the transaction. When a car is sold, the seller can transfer the title along with the car loan to the buyer if the buyer is found creditworthy.     Is There a Limit to How Much Money You Can Transfer Between Accounts? While there isn't a law that limits the amount of money you can transfer between accounts, banks, financial institutions, and money transfer providers often have transaction limits. These limits can vary per day, per month, or per transaction.     How Long Does a Wire Transfer Take? Domestic bank wire transfers may take up to three days in the U.S., but they are faster if the sender and recipient have their accounts in the same bank. International wire transfers usually take up to five business days.     How Do You Transfer a Car Title? Transferring a car's title is quite a straightforward process. If you are buying a car from a dealership, the dealer will provide you with the car title if you are paying for the vehicle yourself. If you are financing the vehicle, they will send the title to the lender.If you are buying from a private seller and they have paid off the vehicle, the current owner will sign the seller’s section of the title and give you a bill of sale. Then you have to submit the necessary paperwork to your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).     The Bottom Line    In finance, a transfer refers to the action of moving money, assets, or ownership rights from one account to another, or from an owner to a new owner.    A transfer can involve moving money between two accounts owned by the same person, or it can involve moving money between accounts owned by different people. Unless you're transferring money internationally, bank transfers are usually free.    Besides money, every kind of asset can be transferred: real estate, car titles, stocks and other securities, intangible goods such as patents, and even loans.  ",2020-05-10

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.Top Stories This WeekThree reasons for the Bitcoin “halving dump” from $10,000 to $8,100We’re less than 48 hours away from “the halvening” — and there’s been no end of drama over the past week. Initially, there was hype as Bitcoin soared, with the world’s biggest cryptocurrency testing $10,000. But over the weekend, a dramatic and sudden sell-off began — a sharp correction that caused BTC to slide all the way back to $8,100. Bitcoin plunged by 9% in a single hour as it failed to tackle the $10,200-to-$10,500 range, which has historically served as a strong level of resistance. Some analysts had been arguing that a sell-off was inevitable because BTC was overbought, but even they were predicting that this would happen after the halving. The big question now is whether that “fear of missing out” remains, whether Bitcoin can bounce back, and whether crypto executives, such as Decred Founder Joseph Young, believe prices will “roughly double” in the short term.What the Bitcoin halving means for minersIt’s worth taking a moment to reflect on the impact that the halving will have on miners. A supply shock is imminent — and once it’s taken place, only 900 new Bitcoin will be entering circulation per day, a sharp decrease from the 1,800 we’ve had for four years. Data suggests that miners are hoarding BTC ahead of the halving, with ByteTree suggesting that higher prices are ahead of us. Many miners will see the expense associated with mining a single Bitcoin rise substantially, far beyond the average of $6,851 reported earlier this year. Some estimates suggest that it could cost anywhere between $12,000 and $15,000 in the not-too-distant future, and this means prices would have to rise if miners have any hope of breaking even.Stairway to scarcity: Bitcoin sentiment to rise despite halving impactThere are several one-off factors that make this halving different from the ones we saw in 2012 and 2016. One of them is the coronavirus crisis — and as countries around the world print trillions of dollars in new money to save their economies, some pundits believe investors will plow into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. There’s also substantially more institutional interest in BTC than there was before. Even senior analysts at Bloomberg, such as Mike McGlone, are bullish — arguing that Bitcoin has a big advantage over long-established assets such as gold. “Restricted supply means adoption is the metric that matters, and most indications remain positive in an unprecedented environment where virtually every central bank is aggressively adding liquidity,” he said.TON community launches free version of Telegram Open NetworkTelegram suffered a massive slap to the face this week when an independent group of software developers, validators and users launched the “Free TON Blockchain.” The rival platform comes as the messaging app continues to be embroiled in a long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This breakaway community says Telegram “can no longer be involved in the project.” The launch came after U.S. investors who invested in TON were told that they won’t be eligible for a 110% refund of their money in April 2021 — and instead, they’ll only get 72% of their capital back now. Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, has reacted furiously to the legal battles brought by the SEC, describing the U.S. as a “police state” and discouraging entrepreneurs from moving their businesses to Silicon Valley.PewDiePie to leave blockchain video platform for exclusive YouTube dealYouTube has signed a new deal with one of the world’s most popular content creators. PewDiePie has been wrestled away from the blockchain platform DLive, meaning he’ll be broadcasting exclusively on the Google-owned video-sharing site. Although PewDiePie was full of praise for DLive because of how they didn’t take large chunks of his revenue as commission, he failed to build anywhere near as much of an audience — attracting barely 1% of the 104 million subscribers he had on YouTube.Winners and LosersAt the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $8,747.34, Ether at $189.88 and XRP at $0.19. The total market cap is at $240,096,291,123.Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are 0x, Crypterium and ABBC Coin.

They’re not in the same position as they used to be ten years ago or even five years ago.”Arnaud Salomon, Mt Pelerin CEO“BTC has just scraped above $10,000 for the first time since mid-February, and an understated aspect of this impressive price surge (overshadowed by halvening news) is the fact that Bitcoin’s development activity rate has grown notably throughout 2020.”Santimant, on-chain data research firm“I definitely think that there’s a role for blockchains — and Ethereum in particular — to play in being this kind of neutral global player role [for] these systems, currencies, and applications to interact. I think anything created and maintained by nation-states can’t play that role.”Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder“Legal proceedings in the U.S. mean that Telegram, the initial creator of TON (Telegram/The Open Network) blockchain, can no longer be involved.”Free TON Community“He [Schiff] tweets more #bitcoin than gold. And his commenters/followers are all bitcoin people. He is the sheep in wolf’s skin.” Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO“If there’s no halvening dump soon, BTC could run straight to ATH.”Logan Han, hedge fund manager“I will go dark if the model is successful because if the model is successful, it will not be a pretty picture.”PlanB, crypto analyst“If this relationship holds... bitcoin would peak at $115,212 /BTC… I realize that price may sound ludicrous to some today... Just sayin’ that there’s more than a 50-50 chance bitcoin goes up – and goes up big.”Dan Morehead, Pantera Capital founder and CEO“Now that Buffett is out of the game and stock buybacks are rightly being called out as fraudulent, investors will ask... If Buffett was dead wrong about so much, was he also wrong about #Bitcoin and Gold? ANSWER: YES. Buffett killed his reputation by being stupid about BTC.”Max Keiser, TV hostPrediction of the Week“Perfect wedge” makes $1 million Bitcoin more likely than ever — Raoul PalThe chances that Bitcoin will hit $40,000 and even $1 million have “risen dramatically” after it hit $10,000, according to Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal. The sky-high figures fall in line with similar findings by PlanB, who has projected that BTC/USD could hit $288,000 between 2020 and 2024, with the potential to at least double that as a maximum. There have been plenty of other upbeat predictions this week. Morgan Creek CEO Mark Yusko believes Bitcoin’s price will shoot up by more than 1,000% as early as next year — adding that, if BTC’s market cap achieves the same value as that of gold, Bitcoin could soar beyond $100,000 at some point between 2021 and 2022. That forecast was echoed by Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead, who said there’s more than a 50/50 chance that Bitcoin goes up “and goes up big” — with $100,000 possible by August next year.FUD of the WeekRipple co-founder Jed McCaleb sold 54 million XRP in AprilAnalysis of Jeb McCaleb’s wallets appears to show that the Ripple co-founder sold off at least 54 million in XRP over the course of April. According to The Crypto Associate, McCaleb is liquidating his supply of tokens on a regular basis — and on average, he flogged 1.8 million XRP every day in April. The proceeds from these sales would come to a grand total of $11.7 million. McCaleb is a key figure in cryptocurrency’s history, having created the Mt. Gox exchange and co-founding Stellar. He also co-founded OpenCoin in 2012, which later became Ripple, and was allocated 9.5 billion XRP when the 100 billion supply was pre-mined.Craig Wright’s Satoshi case goes to trial on July 6It’s a case that’s gripped the crypto community for years. Now, we know that the trial between self-proclaimed Bitcoin investor Craig Wright and the brother of his former business partner is going to begin in July. Ira Kleiman lays claim to half of the 1.1 million BTC that the Australian entrepreneur allegedly mined with Dave Kleiman before his death. Wright, one of the crypto world’s more colorful characters, has certainly had quite a week. He has faced yet another allegation of committing plagiarism — this time, in his doctoral thesis. A blogger has posted purported screenshots of Wright’s 2017 thesis that appears to show similarities with other publicly available sources. Crypto investor sues New York teen for $71.4 million in SIM-swap sagaA teenager is being sued for $71.4 million in damages for allegedly stealing $23.8 million in cryptocurrency from an investor in 2018. Ellis Pinsky was just 15 at the time of the alleged crime, and it’s claimed he and his co-conspirators pulled off the theft by swapping Michael Terpin’s SIM without his knowledge. Terpin says that he has managed to recover $2 million — but now Pinsky is 18, and he has filed a lawsuit to sue for the remaining funds, plus damages. The plaintiff has already managed to win a $75 million civil case against an alleged co-conspirator, and according to court documents, he says: “On the surface, Pinsky is an ‘All American Boy.’ The tables are now turned.”Best Cointelegraph FeaturesBitcoin gains ground on gold, bolsters claim as the asset of tomorrowExperts weigh in on the ongoing gold-versus-Bitcoin debate: Which asset is more capable in these current times?Five things to do other than worry about coronavirus and Bitcoin priceThe Bitcoin halving and coronavirus are still dominating media headlines.

Total Scam! — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) May 10, 2020  Roubini first found about the cryptocurrency years ago but has asserted that this industry is a space for charlatans and good-for-nothings.                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  Peter Schiff, a prominent libertarian economist known for his love for gold, echoed Roubini’s line. The long-time cryptocurrency skeptic, who first found out about Bitcoin over five years ago but didn’t buy, argued that the recent rally is just speculators “selling the news” on the block reward halving taking place in a day: “Looks like some of the Bitcoin speculators who bought in anticipation of the halving couldn’t wait for the actual fact to start selling. As more sellers jump the gun, by the time the fact occurs, the profits those buying the rumor were hoping to cash in on may already be gone.” Schiff added in a later tweet that the leading cryptocurrency “is a fraud” and is “nothing,” arguing that the strict value of the asset is $0. They Won’t Be Laughing for Long But these bears might not be laughing for much longer, analysts have suggested. As reported by Bitcoinist previously, prominent traders believe that the fundamentals of this market remain decisively bullish. Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a New York-based market analysis firm, identified four such fundamentals. These factors, which suggest that medium-term market growth is likely, are as follows:  Bitcoin is the best-performing “asset class” in 2020, beating U.S. Treasuries and Gold amid a global recession. BTC was the best-performing asset class of 2019, rallying 92% while the U.S. stock market gained around 20%. The block reward halving is just 24 hours out. It’s an event that analysts think will boost the cryptocurrency market due to supply-demand dynamics. Paul Tudor Jones, one of the world’s biggest macro investors, just announced his fund is taking a stake in Bitcoin futures. Jones believes the cryptocurrency will act as a hedge against inflation.

On May 9, BTC dropped to the $8,100 mark before making a small recovery to around $8,800.Nevertheless, the fact that BTC has overall been able to stave off bearish market pressure instilled a certain amount of confidence in the hearts of investors all over the globe — despite Bitcoin facing a 15% value slip on May 9.Additionally, it bears mentioning that since dropping to a price point of around $3,867 registered on March 12, Bitcoin’s value has almost tripled, so much so that a report released by blockchain research firm IntoTheBlock claims that nearly 85% — or 25.79 million — of all wallet addresses holding Bitcoin can currently sell at a profit from their holdings.With all of that information out there, it is worth delving deeper into the question of what do Bitcoin’s key market indicators actually suggest about the currency’s future after its halving event, and whether or not the crypto asset is destined for a major financial upswing — as many pundits have repeatedly pointed out since the start of the year.Related: Top Experts Make Bitcoin Price Predictions as BTC Halving ApproachesRelation to BTC’s Fear and Greed IndexTo get a better understanding of everything that’s happening right now with the halving, Cointelegraph reached out to Pascal Gauthier, the CEO of Ledger, a hardware crypto wallet manufacturer, who believes that Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index has remained very conservative all through March and April. However, he did add that his firm has noticed a huge decoupling of people’s interest in crypto — which surged through social media and Google searches — amid the volatility fears surrounding the crypto markets. He also opined that as the halving nears, the greed aspect of the F&amp;G Index seems to have increased quite exponentially, adding that this phenomenon can largely be attributed to the aforementioned event.Similarly, David Waslen, the CEO of HedgeTrade, a blockchain-based forecasting platform, believes that with the halving just a day away, Bitcoin is hovering in the neutral zone of the fear and greed index, coming off a long bearish stretch in the excessive fear zone. He added: “With record-high exchange volumes and all the money pouring into stablecoins (that could easily move into Bitcoin), this neutral phase may not last long.”The aforementioned sentiment is also echoed by Jeffrey Liu Xun, the CEO of XanPool, a peer-to-peer fiat gateway, who opined that while BTC’s Fear and Greed Index has been exhibiting neutral signs, the greed element seems to be taking over and increasing quite rapidly. Xun further said: “The F&amp;G Index just swung from ‘extreme fear’ into the neutral territory and seems to be gathering steam towards the ‘Extreme greed’ territory.”The effect on the hash rate will be noticeableBitcoin’s halving is a fundamental event that most people from within the crypto community look forward to every four years, as it directly relates to the supply and demand of the premier crypto asset. And while the halving does not always have a direct relation with the Fear and Greed Index for BTC, it certainly has an effect on the cryptocurrency’s hash rate 100% of the time. This is because, after the event, block-reward sizes become smaller, which leads to a drastic increase in mining efficiency-related requirements. To get a more holistic view of how the halving will impact Bitcoin’s hash rate, Cointelegraph reached out to Lennix Lai, the director of financial markets at crypto trading platform OKEx. In his view:“In the short term, we may see some miners being unable to continue in the game. This means that the hashrate has the potential to go lower. However, with enhanced equipment and miners becoming more efficient, hashrate will gradually pick up again.”Similarly, Marie Tatibouet, the CMO of Gate.io, a Bitcoin exchange platform, pointed out that if one were to go by previously recorded data, Bitcoin halving events have traditionally been followed by a gradual increase in the network’s hash rate — only to dip once again three months after the event. She further said: “The hash rate also surged at a rapid pace after the second halving in 2017. If we buy some of these data trends, I believe the hash rate will increase in the one month window after the halving.”Lastly, a number of experts also tend to agree with the notion that a rise in the hash rate will most likely be witnessed in the near future since a large number of BTC miners may have to start consolidating their resources in order to stay afloat within this space. Not only that, but it is also entirely possible that the day-to-day workings of this burgeoning sector may become defined by the activities of a fair few individuals or groups who own sizeable rigs and have the necessary capital to weather the imminent threat of reduced block rewards.The halving’s impact on Bitcoin’s priceAs the reduction in Bitcoin’s block reward quotient will become apparent immediately — i.e., the amount of BTC received per block will drop from 12.5 to 6.25. This reduction, in Lai’s opinion, will most likely force smaller-scale miners to potentially go out of business and lead to an increased amount of sell-off pressure, which, in turn, may result in the crypto market turning bearish in the short term. However, in the longer term, Lai believes that BTC’s price will rebound because, from a macroeconomic perspective, BTC has begun proving itself as a safe-haven asset.Also, following the halving, if Bitcoin’s hash rate falls, then historical data seems to point to the fact that the currency’s price will most likely follow suit. In this regard, looking at data from 2012 and 2016, the premier crypto asset’s price rallied before each event and corrected itself shortly after. Similarly, in both cases, the medium-term saw BTC’s value rise by a whopping 10,000% in 2012 and then again by 2,500% in 2016.Xun, too, believes that in the short-term, a price dump may occur. In this regard, he clarified: “I see a local top occurring on the halvening date + - 2 days or so. And then the price trading lower than that for a short term period.” However, Kade Almendinger, a co-host of the Dark Side of the HODL Moon podcast, firmly believes that any potential monetary upsurges in BTC’s future may have already been factored into the currency’s existing value. He added:“We already saw a price run-up from April 28th to the 30th and then a sell-off correction later on the 30th of April. It came up again on May 6th and seems to have some support at $9,200. The bulls will likely push it higher pre-halving and I wouldn’t be surprised to see $10K plus BTC prior to the halving, with a modest sell-off and price correction post halving.”COVID-19 induced uncertainty Considering the post-halving surges that followed the first two halvings, it would not be surprising to see a similar growth spurt in BTC’s near-term future. However, this time, owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, experts are eagerly waiting to see how the current situation affects the premier crypto’s financial future — especially as the virus continues to bring stock markets all over the world down to their knees. On the subject, Tatibouet stated:“I believe the COVID 19 pandemic has a great role to play in the larger scheme of things. Initially, it created some anxiety in the investor community and then eventually it stabilized. We have seen BTC trading on our platform increase after the COVID-19 hit China. I think the rise in Bitcoin trading volume, in general, is responsible for Bitcoin’s recent recovery and eventually its stability.”Similarly, Lai, too, believes that the current crypto market looks cautiously bullish despite the COVID-19 crisis plunging the global economy into a massive depression. In this regard, he added: “Most central banks have been considering alternative non-currency asset classes. However, they have their limitations when it comes to hedging the risks initiated by COVID-19-induced global lockdown, especially in the equity market.”Is Bitcoin’s momentum all FOMO?In order to evaluate whether BTCs current financial momentum is sustainable or if it’s just a by-product of widespread market fear of missing out, or FOMO, it is worth considering the fact that the ongoing optimism surrounding the industry might be because the Bitcoin network has matured over the past decade — so much so that it now supports hundreds of exchanges, futures markets, lending programs, wallets, swap platforms, as well as various blockchain-based financial applications. In this regard, Waslen added:“People are bullish for sure, and maybe some of that is based on hype. But it’s also because of all the building that’s been going on plus the fact that Bitcoin has the largest, decentralized computer in the world providing security for its global users. For 10 years, it’s been going strong, has not been hacked, and has exceeded the ROI of every other asset (over the decade).”Lastly, Gauthier believes that the pandemic has caused traditional finance players to re-evaluate their long-held beliefs in such a way that many mainstream corporate entities have started looking at Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value — something, he believes, has helped create positive momentum for the premier crypto asset.A post-halving outlookMost crypto pundits are of the opinion that BTC’s financial potential cannot be ascertained accurately in the short-term due to a number of technical variables that are difficult to evaluate. Additionally, with Bitcoin’s current value hovering at levels much lower than what they were back in 2017, many of the “get-rich-quick type individuals” have largely disappeared from this space, thus leaving the ecosystem largely in the hands of those who are interested in making use of the digital potential of BTC to create novel financial platforms, as well as other similar offerings. Speaking on Bitcoin’s future, Adam Traidman, the CEO and co-founder of BRD, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, told Cointelegraph:“Warren Buffet won’t invest in Bitcoin because it’s too volatile, yet look at oil. The old ways of thinking are behind us. Compared to a majority of other assets, if you held Bitcoin throughout this year, you would’ve ended up towards the top. There’s a reason that a lot of long-time Bitcoin enthusiasts say that no matter what happens with volatility, at the end of the day, if you believe in the future of Bitcoin, any of these prices are a great deal.” ",2020-05-10

This appears to have shaken out over-exuberant margin traders who longed near $10,000 on heavy margin.According to market data aggregator, Cryptometer, over $295 million worth liquidations occurred on BitMEX alone — 98% of which were long positions. By contrast, liquidated shorts totaled $5.7 million.$290M liquidated on BitMEX in 24 hoursRoughly 93% of yesterday’s liquidations took place in BitMEX’s XBT/USD markets, with Ripple (XRP) liquidations representing 4.1% with $12.3 million, and Ethereum (ETH) margin calls comprising 2.2% with $6.5 million. XRP and ETH short liquidations represented just 0.02% and 0.22% of the respective markets’ total liquidations.$10,000 longs suffer heavy lossesThe liquidations likely wiped out the longs of many retail investors hoping to cash-in on the upcoming halving. What they may not have considered is that Bitcoin had already gained 150% in less than two months.Many top cryptocurrency exchanges have contributed to driving hype for the halving in recent weeks, posting articles emphasizing bullish cases for the block reward promotion.Exchanges drive pre-halving hypeOn May 5, Bittrex Global sent an email to its users featuring the subject “Buy More Bitcoin Before the Halving!”. This email notified their mailing list that the exchange had increased its credit card limits “just in time for the Bitcoin halving.” Traders who purchased BTC on May 5 would currently be sitting at break-even after falling into the red during yesterday’s crash.On May 9, high-leverage derivatives exchange, Bybit, published a report purporting to examine the state of the market pre-halving amid BTC’s retest of the $10,000 area. The report laid out several cases for a bull trend, contrasted by only four sentences offering reasons for why the price may be contained in the short run. Traders who purchased at $10,000 would be sitting on a 15% loss as of this writing, except for those who purchase with leverage of 5x or greater — who would have been liquidated during the flash crash.

This gave the crypto’s uptrend an illusion of immense stability, but the rug pull overnight that led Bitcoin to lows of $8,100 has invalidated this notion and appears to have opened the gates for it to see further near-term downside.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Critics Revel in BTC’s Decline Bitcoin has its fair share of critics, and two of the most outspoken ones have taken its latest decline as an opportunity to heap hate onto the benchmark digital asset. Economist Nouriel Roubini stated that the 15% decline seen yesterday proves that Bitcoin is a “total scam.” “Bitcoin crashes by 15% in 7 minutes on NO news: a rigged, totally manipulated, whales-controlled market where most transactions (90%) volumes are false as exchanges pretend to have liquidity they don’t have. Massive pump &amp; dump, spoofing, front running, wash trading! Total Scam!”  Bitcoin crashes by 15% in 7 minutes on NO news: a rigged, totally manipulated, whales-controlled market where most transactions (90%) volumes are false as exchanges pretend to have liquidity they don't have. Massive pump &amp; dump, spoofing, front running, wash trading! Total Scam! — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) May 10, 2020  Gold bug and outspoken BTC critic Peter Schiff also echoed this sentiment, explaining that the crypto’s decline is the result of investors pulling funds out as the halving event’s hype fades. “Looks like some of the Bitcoin speculators who bought in anticipation of the halving couldn’t wait for the actual fact to start selling. As more sellers jump the gun, by the time the fact occurs, the profits those buying the rumor were hoping to cash in on may already be gone.”  Looks like some of the #Bitcoin speculators who bought in anticipation of the halving couldn't wait for the actual fact to start selling. As more sellers jump the gun, by the time the fact occurs, the profits those buying the rumor were hoping to cash in on may already be gone. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 10, 2020  Both of these individuals are ignoring the elephant in the room, however. Despite BTC’s sharp overnight decline, the cryptocurrency is still one of the best performing assets in 2020, with a 7% lead over gold and a nearly 30% lead over the S&amp;P 500.

All of these challenges are just another kind of mental exercise, he believes. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to him making frequent appearances in public to answer questions about how his security agency is helping, particularly in keeping businesses and peoples' activities in line with the state of emergency. As the ""new normal"" increasingly refers to how people's lives are likely to change in the aftermath of the pandemic, Gen Somsak also quickly links the term to security issues. People will come to depend on tools that facilitate working from home and virtual contact to suit social distancing guidelines, and will inevitably end up living a greater part of their lives online, he says. ""And with online lifestyles come online threats,"" Gen Somsak said, warning that ""cyber-attacks will be more intense"". The government and businesses must be kept abreast of new tricks which cyber-criminals are using to attack financial institutions and national infrastructure, he said. ""If their protection fails, they need to have cyber-resilience."" These preparations do not require tremendous manpower as the process is more about expertise and predicting how the virtual landscape may change, according to Gen Somsak. Economically, Gen Somsak thinks Thailand can escape the worst effects of the pandemic if makes full use of its strengths. ""A country with a strong healthcare system which is also an economic centre in the heart of Asean can quickly bounce back from a crisis,"" he said. He also pointed to the ""sufficiency economy"" concept, introduced by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great during the 1997 financial crash, as another indicator of Thailand's ability to chart a course during the coming months. ""The concept teaches us to be more self-reliant,"" Gen Somsak said, adding its benefits have been proven and it is already part of the government's 20-year national strategy, which will direct the country's economic and social development until 2037. ""Thailand cannot ignore this sufficiency economy as doubts are growing over whether key economic communities like the European Union and the Asean can really help people in their regions deal with the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Nobody can say for sure they can do it,"" Gen Somsak said. ""That's why each country needs to rely more on itself."" Gen Somsak's interest in economics and the changing face of modern society stems from a personal history that is somewhat removed from the stereotypical path that many take into the upper echelons of the army. During his childhood, young Somsak was a top-grade student and generally thought of as a scholar in the making. And even though he later decided to choose a more adventurous route by studying at Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, he still had a passion for the complex world of knowledge. After gaining top scores in his class, he was awarded an army scholarship to study for a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Virginia Military Institute in the US. His post-graduate study was also in the field of electrical engineering. The roles he later took on in the army and at the Defence Ministry mostly involved technology, infrastructure and policymaking before he was appointed to lead the NSC last year. Among the NSC's priorities is a mission to solve the insurgency in Muslim-dominated provinces, which was sparked by separatist groups and has plagued the deep South since 2004. ""We prefer to approach the problem with development projects rather than military missions,"" Gen Somsak said. The government, too, is attempting to follow this path, spending more in regional development than military operations in recent years, and building the confidence of locals, he said. Gen Somsak is also a key member of the Thai delegation responsible for maintaining a dialogue with Mara Patani, an umbrella organisation of various separatist movements, to talk them into ending the long-running conflict. Despite a list of achievements that he is only too happy to point towards, his rise to the top of the NSC has not been without criticism. Observers have questioned why the last three NSC leaders, including Gen Somsak, have come from military units and accused Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha of favouring candidates with a similar military background to himself. ""Wherever they [agency heads] come from, be it the military or civil service, is not important,"" Gen Somsak argued. ""The point is whether they can do their duty as an NSC chief."" ",2020-05-10

Now bitcoin has fully recovered from these dark moments in mid-March and on Friday crossed the $10,000 level once again. While central bankers around the world are quantitatively easing their fiat Ponzi schemes, bitcoin will experience its third quantitative hardening in just a few days.... Review In my last Bitcoin (BTC-USD) analysis, at a price around $6,700, I expected the recovery to continue until around $8,000. Indeed, this is what happened. However, for several weeks prices were just slowly creeping higher. Only once the downtrend line at $7,150 was crossed the bitcoin market finally began to move on 23rd of April. Since then, the bullish forces have clearly asserted themselves and most recently drove bitcoin to its highest level at $10,025 since mid of February. Bitcoin has thus made up for all the losses from the crash in mid-March and presents itself very strong compared to almost all other asset classes.  Â© Holger Zschaepitzâ @Schuldensuehner, 5th of May 2020 In addition to the technical breakout above $7,150, the reasons for the sharp rally in recent weeks are mainly to be found in the upcoming bitcoin halving and the unprecedented global money supply expansions. The corona crisis has definitely changed the world. An infinite number of small and large companies as well as an army of millions of new unemployed are now completely dependent on public funding. At every corner there is overcapacity, reflecting the sick frenzy of the last decades. With their balance sheet measurements, central banks are already surpassing everything that has been seen before, but in the end they too will have to realize that wealth cannot be created with the mere printing of currency.  Â© Holger Zschaepitzâ @Schuldensuehner, May 4th 2020 On the contrary, the dramatic increase in debt will sooner or later devalue the purchasing power of euros and dollars etc. to an extreme degree. The US Treasury Department, for example, is planning a new record borrowing of $3 trillion between April and June in order to be able to pay the enormous coronavirus costs. A further $677 billion is planned for the 3rd quarter. Last year, $1.28 trillion new debts were already made. In the end, it is the citizens and taxpayers who pay this bill. Forward-thinking investors have therefore stormed into the safe haven of gold in recent weeks. In the case of bitcoin, despite its relative strength, there has so far been no real sign of a flight to safety. Instead, the crypto currency has correlated much more strongly with the stock markets in recent weeks than usual. However, since about two weeks bitcoin is literally on fire. Technical Analysis For Bitcoin Bitcoin Weekly Chart as of May 8th 2020, Source: Tradingview Since its low of just under $3,800 on March 12th, Bitcoin has risen by 160% to $10,025 in the last eight weeks. This V-shaped recovery is currently taking Bitcoin to the longstanding former uptrend line from below. The break of this trend line caused the crash to $3,800 two months ago. A direct breakout above this resistance was a surprise but has already happened. Another serious resistance has been the downward trend line of the last 10 months. Bitcoin jumped above this line without any problems just yesterday. The now realizing best case scenario has some more room to go. The 61.8% retracement at around $10,050 and also the 78.6% retracement at $11,733 are realistic targets. Even a direct rally towards the horizontal resistance zone between $12,500 and $13,800 has become a possibility. The stochastic oscillator is not yet overbought and is therefore not opposing this bullish scenario. In summary, the weekly chart is bullish since the end of March. No reversal signals have been detected yet. Rather, the bulls still have room to move up to around $13,000. Bitcoin Daily Chart as of May 8th 2020, Source: Tradingview On the daily chart, the concentrated resistance zone around $9,200 was obviously not a real obstacle. However, the chart is now overbought while bulls stretching the upper Bollinger Band. So far, there are no reversal signals yet and a continuation of the rally has the better prospects for the time being. Moreover, Bitcoin is known for its extreme movements, which often overrun many support or resistance zones in both directions. But of course, the risk/reward-ratio at the current level is extremely unfavorable for new long positions. Overall the daily chart is still bullish, but also overbought. A continuation of the rally towards $11,000 and higher seems possible. But the round psychological number $10,000 could also see some profit taking and initiate a healthy pullback. Also, be aware that there is a looming bearish wedge developing. A pullback would already represent a good buying opportunity in the range between $7,500 and $7,700. In the short term, however, it is difficult to imagine larger price declines while halving is just a few days away. Commitments of Traders Report For Bitcoin Bitcoin CME Future CoT-report, Source: Barchart Since the high on February 13th at just under $10,500, there have been significant shifts in the bitcoin futures market. The so-called ""leveraged funds"" were ideally positioned with an extraordinarily high short position for the crash in mid-March. Since the low below $4,000, this group of market participants has quickly started to cover their shorts and recently achieved an almost neutral position. In the latest price increase above $9,000, however, the ""leveraged funds"" have again slightly expanded their short position. The subgroup of the so-called ""Other Reportables"" had distinguished itself with a very successful countercyclical approach over the past two years. This time, however, this group entered the correction rather procyclically with a high long position. In the meantime, however, a rather neutral position has also been achieved here. Despite the wild movements, the current CoT report is again neutral. None of the trader groups is currently taking an extreme position. Noticeable is the significantly increased ""open interest"", which has more than doubled compared to the December lows. Sentiment Bitcoin Bitcoin Optix as of May 6th, 2020. Source: Sentimentrader Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index as of May 6th, 2020. Source: Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index as of May 7th, 2020. Source: Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index In the short term the mood for bitcoin seems a little bit too optimistic as the Bitcoin Optix of Sentimentrader has measured extreme values for the first time since mid-February. In the medium and longer term, however, no exaggeration can be detected in sentiment. Rather, the sophisticated ""Fear &amp; Greed Index"" is still sitting in its neutral zone with a recent value of 49. In summary, sentiment provides a warning signal in the very short term. However, in the bigger pictures the mood in the crypto world is far from being a big party, therefore any pullback in bitcoin should represent another buying opportunity. The ""sentiment analysis module"" thus produces the recommendation ""buy the next dip"". Seasonality Bitcoin Bitcoin seasonality. Source: Seasonax Based on the evaluation of the last nine years, bitcoin has developed a fairly clear seasonal pattern, which certainly is a useful tool for general timing. In fact, this statistical pattern seems to be working quite well so far this year as bitcoin started a new wave up in mid of March. According to the seasonal pattern, this rally could extend into June, before a corrective wave would take place over the summer months. The seasonal component has been favorable since the end of February and supports rising bitcoin prices into early summer. Bitcoin against gold Sound Money Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio as of May 4th, 2020. Source: Chaia Currently, you have to pay 5.74 ounces of gold for one single bitcoin. In other words, one troy ounce of gold currently costs only 0.174 bitcoin. Based on the numbers, bitcoin has hardly moved against gold since the beginning of this year. Nevertheless, in the last four months there have been strong movements in favor of both, gold and bitcoin. At the moment bitcoin has the tailwind again and is heading for the downtrend line of the last two and a half years. If there is an upward breakout from the triangle formation, the crypto winter should definitely be over for good and bitcoin should begin its journey towards its all-time highs at $20,000. Generally, buying and selling Bitcoin against gold only makes sense to the extent that one balances the allocation in the two asset classes! At least 10% and a maximum of 25% of one's total assets should be invested in precious metals physically, while in cryptos and especially in Bitcoin one should hold at least 1% and a maximum of 5%. If you are very familiar with cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, you can certainly allocate higher percentages to Bitcoin on an individual basis. For the average investor, who is normally also invested in equities and real estate, 5% in the highly speculative and highly volatile bitcoin is already a lot! From a spiritual point of view, think of bitcoin and gold as another expression of our dualistic world. As we have sun and moon, summer and winter, warm and cold all representing various forms of Yin and Yang, it also makes sense to have an analog safe haven (gold) and a digital safe haven (bitcoin) in the 21st century. You want to have both! Conclusion In the longer term, the events of the last two and a half months are without any doubt extremely bullish for bitcoin. A brutal wave of insolvencies could not only turn our economic world upside down, but also fundamentally change the entire financial system! The biggest stimuli ever seen from governments and central banks have already shaken confidence in the fiat money systems to their very foundations. More and more people are realizing that government and money must be separated and that fiat money systems are responsible for the unfair distribution of opportunities and the unrestrained and undisciplined waste of the planet's natural resources. Â© Holger Zschaepitzâ @Schuldensuehner, 5th of May 2020 In addition to this already bullish mixture, the 3rd bitcoin halving will happen in just a few days. The first two bitcoin Halvings were each followed by an extreme rally and increases of 10,000% and 2,500% within one to two years!  Â©Tavi Costa @Crescant Capital, April 29th 2020 However, a further deflationary phase in the markets cannot yet be completely ruled out. In fact, the situation is far too complex to blindly bet on inflation and hyperinflation at this stage. Recently, central banks have significantly reduced their support measures, even though well over $50 trillion have been destroyed worldwide by the corona crash. At the same time the money supply expansions could be sufficient to send gold and bitcoin into the stratosphere. But another deflationary wave or crash in the equity markets would affect gold and bitcoin too. On top, Gold and bitcoin are overbought and don't deliver a good risk reward ratio in the short-term. Yes, any dip or pullback in these two markets needs to be bought! Overall, Bitcoin is making a strong impression these days. The breakout above the two resistance lines seems indeed to be successful and prices have reached $10,000. From here, bitcoin only needs to double to reach its all-time high. Anyone who has studied bitcoin knows how quickly a 100% rise can happen.  Nevertheless it is important to proceed carefully and patiently. On the way up, there will always be setbacks and thus also buying opportunities. Such a one would already represent itself with a possible pullback towards $7,700 at any time.",2020-05-10

According to a former member of China operations at Bitcoin Magazine, Molly (her last name is not given), the article from CCTV mentioned BTC’s third halving and the recent price pump to $10,000.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  While there aren’t any concrete English translations of the article, the article mentioned how BTC outperformed in the wake of previous halvings. A Global Trend BTC may soon get a similar treatment of popularity across the pond, so to say, in the U.S. and abroad. Ahead of the halving, investors in the Western world have been searching for terms related to the leading cryptocurrency much more than they have just months ago.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Below is a chart from Google Trends illustrating that search interest from Americans in the terms “Bitcoin halving,” “Buy Bitcoin,” and “what is Bitcoin.” are skyrocketing, boding well for the bullish narrative. Data from Google Trends showing search interest in the terms “Bitcoin halving,” “Buy Bitcoin,” and “what is Bitcoin.” This trend is slated to continue because of public awareness brought to the cryptocurrency market by investors like Paul Tudor Jones, who is slated to speak to CNBC on Monday regarding his thoughts on markets and his optimism about BTC.  Image shared online of CNBC’s guest lineup. Paul Tudor Jones, a new Bitcoin bull, is expected to speak on Monday morning about his thoughts on cryptocurrency and markets. Adding to this, BTC and other blockchain topics have been recently mentioned in mainstream television shows. The Sunday before last, supersized finance drama Billions had its season five premiere on Showtime. It was a much-anticipated release, making it all the more surprising when the words “Bitcoin” escaped the lips of an actor. The character that is a U.S. state attorney rants about how absurd he finds the concept of mining and the value of BTC: “So your multitude of computers and services solve some abstract math equations resulting in the mining of what, Bitcoin? Worth millions right now, backed by what?” Photo by James Coleman on Unsplash Tags: bitcoinbtcusdchinatwitterweibo ",2020-05-10

As the drop came so fast, few were ready to handle the effects it would have on their portfolio.

As a note, just because $1.22 billion was liquidated doesn’t mean that $1.22 billion was lost. Due to leverage, the actual value of coins that traders lost may be under $1 billion.                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  Data from CryptoDiffer (@CryptoDiffer on Twitter). The graph is of the aggregate value of the crypto market’s liquidation events on May 10th. What happened was due to the fact that investors expected more upside ahead of the halving, they were leveraged long. That’s to say, they borrowed money from exchanges betting that Bitcoin was going higher. But since prices dropped so quick, they were unable to maintain their positions due to a lack of margin, of cryptocurrency, in their accounts. This resulted in this mass liquidation event, the biggest since the March 12th “Black Thursday” crash. Validation of “HODL” Mindset To many Bitcoin investors, the data above is validation of the “HODL” investment mentality. “HODLing” coins means to not trade, sell, or otherwise lose your cryptocurrency. It’s a mindset that promotes patience and long-term growth over speculation and short-term trading. While noted cryptocurrency critics like Nouriel Roubini and Peter Schiff have lambasted this mindset, analysts are hopeful that it will work as we move forward into 2020 and beyond. One trader made this much clear when he argued that there is a confluence of four fundamental factors that makes him “struggle to see a bearish case for Bitcoin.” These factors are as follows:  Bitcoin’s block reward halving is taking place in approximately one day. Bitcoin’s narrative of being a hedge against economic downturns is “showing potential,” likely referencing how the cryptocurrency is the best-performing asset this year despite a global recession brewing. BTC has seen incredible strength from the $3,700 lows seen in March. Exchange dynamics are shifting in favor of growth, as buying increases and sell-side demand may slow.

With just less than 24-hours before the block reward halving is scheduled to take place, traders are likely biting their nails and anxious to see if the top ranked crypto-asset on CoinMarketCap will be able to reclaim $9,000. Crypto market weekly price chart.

As discussed in previous analysis, below the $9,800 support the next notable support level was at $8,800 and under this $7,400 was the level some traders had set their sights on. BTC USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewSaturday’s swift fall from $9,560 to $8,122 sliced right through both of the aforementioned supports but if bulls can push through the VPVR nodes at $8,739-$8,952 a recovery to $9,300 is on the table. Looking forwardFor the short term, traders should watch the 30-min and hourly timeframe to see if increasing purchasing volume will allow the price to push above the resistance at $8,784. As the hourly chart shows, there is a VPVR volume gap from $8,766 to $9,024 and volume permitting the price could extend to $9,176 if $8,784 is overcome. So far the price continues to find buyers at the ascending channel trendline but more cautious traders might consider waiting for an hourly close above $8,900 before opening a position.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.
