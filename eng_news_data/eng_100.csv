Broader financial markets were weighed by increasingly hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve speakers, in response to recent data that signaled a stubbornly resilient labor market. Meanwhile, Kraken ended its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program and will pay $30M to settle the SEC's charges. The regulator alleged that Kraken failed to register its staking program, which exposed investors to risks with minimal protection. ""As the SEC has so far not even approved a Bitcoin spot ETF, it seems unlikely that it would have approved a slightly more obscure product like staking,"" said Markus Thielsen, head of research, Matrixport. ""While the SEC enforcement is negative for the industry, it excluded U.S. crypto users from being part of the innovation. The winners will likely be staking providers in Asia."" Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong warned that the SEC may want to get rid of crypto staking for retail customers entirely.  Bitcoin (BTC-USD) remained within $21.55K-$23.68K this week, stalling its rally this year. The global crypto market cap currently stands at $1.01T, down 0.7% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap.  Regulatory Updates   Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller called crypto a ""speculative asset, like a baseball card."" He also cautioned that if the price of cryptos drop to zero, ""don't expect taxpayers to socialize your losses."" But Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said cryptos will likely remain in demand despite the recent bear market. Meanwhile, the SEC warned investors that crypto investments in some self-directed IRAs may be unregistered securities.  Contagion Continues  Crypto exchange LocalBitcoins is shutting down after operating for over 10 years as a result of the ""very cold crypto-winter"". Crypto ATM operator Coin Cloud filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with estimated liabilities of up to $500M. The company owes over $100M to insolvent crypto lender Genesis, its largest creditor. Digital Currency Group began offloading shares in trusts operated by its unit Grayscale Investments at a deep discount as it seeks to raise funds to repay creditors of its unit Genesis. Ishan Wahi, a former Coinbase (COIN) executive, reportedly pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in the first ever crypto insider trading scheme.  Notable News  Hut 8 Mining (HUT) will merge with US Bitcoin in an all-stock merger of equals that's expected to give the combined company a market cap of ~$990M. The news sent crypto mining stocks lower as more consolidation is expected in the sector. Deutsche Bank's asset management unit, DWS Group, is reportedly considering taking minority stakes in two crypto firms as a means to spark growth. PayPal has halted stablecoin work as New York regulators are reportedly investigating its key partner in the project.  Bitcoin price  Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dipped 0.7% to $21.64K at 7 pm ET and ether (ETH-USD) fell 2.1% to $1.51K. SA contributor Ryan Wilday said bitcoin's (BTC-USD) rally over the last month is promising, but bulls have more work to do to confirm that the bearish trend that began in 2021 has ended.   Crypto-related stocks that ended lower on Friday: CleanSpark (CLSK) -8.8%, Hut 8 Mining (HUT) -8.2%, Bitfarms (BITF) -6.6%. Coinbase (COIN) -4.3%, Riot Platforms (RIOT) -2.5%.",2023-02-11

A letter from the Troutman Pepper law firm reads: Our firm represents a large group of significant donors to Project Veritas who have grave concerns about the Board of Directors‚Äô reported action to remove Founder and CEO James O‚ÄôKeefe from this leadership position, change the structure of Project Veritas entities and their Boards (raising risks for the entities‚Äô charitable status), and operate Project Veritas for purposes other than those for which the organization was established.

American Pravda: My Fight for Truth in the Era of Fake News  by James O‚ÄôKeefe As Headline USA noted yesterday, Project Veritas‚Äôs board is slated to meet Friday, when O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs potential ouster will be discussed, one source told the Intelligencer.     The backlash from all fronts was fierce and furious when news broke about the brewing coup. ‚ÄúAbsolute madness if he is being forced out just weeks after Project Veritas celebrates one of their greatest-ever journalistic investigations with which O‚ÄôKeefe was intimately involved,‚Äù wrote Human Events editor Ben Kew. ‚ÄúThere is no Project Veritas without James O‚ÄôKeefe,‚Äù Candace Owens tweeted. ‚ÄúI say this as a donor to the organization, but more importantly as a colleague who watched him pour everything he had into PV over the years. The money and supporters will follow James.‚Äù Project Veritas‚Äôs board of directors tried to deflect the heat, shifting blame on ‚ÄúCorporate Media‚Äù for fanning flames and posting a response to the backlash. ‚ÄúDespite what the Corporate Media tries to portray about our organization, know this: We have never been more motivated and dedicated to our mission than now,‚Äù the group tweeted. Fans, supporters and colleagues of O‚ÄôKeefe were less than impressed, and continued to express their support for the investigative journalist.  If the Project Veritas thing isn't a coup against James OKeefe, then why didn't everyone resign and start their own group raising money from their own donors?

Thanks to Children‚Äôs Health Defense for publishing an article that provides more details about why consumers should be able to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to smart meters as well as inferior ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù meters being offered by utilities.  Don‚Äôt Want a Smart Meter? Take It Up With Your State Lawmakers, Experts Say State legislatures and the state utility commissions are where the battle to opt out of smart meters must be fought, according to W. Scott McCollough, former Texas assistant attorney general, and telecom and administrative law attorney and lead litigator for Children‚Äôs Health Defense. By¬†Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D.  Massachusetts last month became the latest state to introduce smart meter legislation with a bill that would require the state‚Äôs utility companies to obtain written consent from consumers before installing a smart meter. The bill also would also eliminate fees for consumers who want to opt out of smart meters. Massachusetts Sen. Michael O. Moore introduced the bill on Jan. 19, less than a week after the state‚Äôs two largest utility companies ‚Äî Eversource and National Grid ‚Äî filed tariff requests seeking to charge consumers a smart meter opt-out fee of $34 per month and $11 per month, respectively. Massachusetts is one of at least seven states that have a statewide smart meter opt-out policy, according to an August 2019 brief by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). New York also last month introduced legislation in the form of a bill that would direct utility companies to study the ‚Äúpotential health risks and effects of smart meters‚Äù and report their findings to a public service commission, which would then present the information to the governor and legislature. Other states already have passed laws governing smart meters. For example, California was the first state to create an opt-out program, according to the Coalition to Stop Smart Meters in British Columbia, Canada. And New Hampshire law requires customer consent for smart meter installation while Pennsylvania law prohibits opt-outs. According to the NCSL: ‚ÄúIn another 22 states, utility regulators have ruled on whether utilities can implement opt-out programs on a case-by-case basis. ‚ÄúIn recent years, the issue has more frequently landed before state legislatures, with at least 17 states considering smart meter opt-out legislation in the past four legislative sessions.‚Äù However, up-to-date estimates of state-level smart meter legislation are difficult to come by because the issue is sometimes handled at the municipal level or via the policy of the individual utility providers ‚Äî of which there may be more than one in a given state. As a wireless technology, smart meters emit a form of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) called radiowaves, or radiofrequencies (RF). Some people ‚Äî particularly those who experience electromagnetic sensitivity ‚Äî allege that exposure to RF through smart meters installed at their homes has a negative effect on their health. ‚ÄúSmart meters threaten the health and well-being of those who are or will be sensitive to EMR,‚Äù said W. Scott McCollough, lead litigator on behalf of Children‚Äôs Health Defense‚Äôs EMR-related legal work. McCollough, a former Texas assistant attorney general and telecom and administrative law attorney, told The Defender: ‚ÄúState legislatures and the state utility commissions are where this battle must be fought in terms of a general right to opt out. ‚ÄúPeople who care about such things should write their elected representatives and demand a right to opt out.‚Äù As of September 2022, more than a dozen U.S. utilities and multiple Canadian utilities do not offer an analog opt-out option, according to a comprehensive list compiled by the Coalition to Stop Smart Meters. McCollough underscored the importance of concerned citizens telling their state legislators to enact opt-out legislation, preferably without additional charge. Sometimes utility companies offer choices, but ‚Ä¶ In some states that don‚Äôt have laws governing smart meters, some utility companies voluntarily ‚Äî sometimes under consumer pressure ‚Äî offer alternatives to smart meters, although those alternatives may not be as consumer-friendly as protections afforded by state laws. In Hawaii, customers of Maui Utility can choose to opt in ‚Äî rather than opt out ‚Äî of having a smart meter installed. But in Virginia, Dominion Energy provides consumers an ‚Äúopt-out meter‚Äù ‚Äî but it‚Äôs just a smart meter that is supposed to have the RF antennae disabled or removed, said Jenny DeMarco, communications director for Virginians for Safe Technology. Patricia Burke of Safe Tech International said this type of meter ‚Äî assuming the RF antennae has been effectively disabled or removed ‚Äî may still bring dirty electricity, another form of EMR ‚Äúpollution,‚Äù into a home and could exacerbate the symptoms of those who experience electromagnetic sensitivity. Additionally, this version of a smart meter still poses health risks, according to Dr. Alexia McKnight, a veterinary radiologist active in smart meter citizens‚Äô rights in Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúGiven that the RF emissions are not the only mechanism of injury, these ‚Äòopt-out smart meters‚Äô usually still contain a switch mode power supply to operate the digital display,‚Äù McKnight said. McKnight explained: ‚ÄúThis switch mode power supply is responsible for an excessive amount of conducted emissions that are placed onto and broadcast from the building‚Äôs wiring into the living spaces. These conducted emissions are the ‚Äòdirty electricity‚Äô problem from smart meters. ‚ÄúSome experts warn that the radiation caused by these unintentional conducted emissions may even be more hazardous to biological function than the more well-known radio frequency radiation the meters were designed to emit. ‚ÄúAll this to say that electromechanical analog meters do not have switch mode power supplies, they do not have the conducted emissions problem, they do not emit RF, and they entirely resolve the clinical suffering caused by any and all mechanisms of injury from smart meters.‚Äù ‚ÄúCustomers should be demanding electromechanical analog meters and utilities should be providing them,‚Äù McKnight said. The number of smart meters installed on the U.S. grid reached 103.1 million in 2020, according to an assessment of the country‚Äôs demand response and advanced metering capabilities published in December 2022 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, UtilityDive reported on Dec. 21, 2022. The Edison Foundation‚Äôs Institute for Electric Innovation in April 2022 estimated more than 124 million smart meters would be installed covering 78% of U.S. households by the close of 2022 ‚Äî and that number continues to grow in 2023.

Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) February 3, 2023 Worcester, Massachusetts: ‚Äòon the front lines of the smart meter battle‚Äô Under the bill introduced in Massachusetts by Moore, the state‚Äôs Department of Public Utilities would have to require utility companies to provide consumers: (1) A choice of the type of utility meters to be installed and operated on their places of residence, property or business; among the choices offered shall be the installation and ongoing operation of an ‚Äúelectromechanical analog meter‚Äù; and (2) The ability to retain and operate an ‚Äúelectromechanical analog meter‚Äù on an ongoing basis at no cost; and (3) The right to replacement of a wireless meter with a non-transmitting electromechanical meter at no cost. Moore‚Äôs district of Worcester, Massachusetts, has ‚Äúbeen on the front lines of the smart meter battle‚Äù since 2013, when roughly 15,000 of its citizens were auto-enrolled in National Grid‚Äôs Smart Grid pilot program, according to Burke. According to a report prepared by Burke, ‚Äú‚ÄòSmart‚Äô electricity meters were installed on homes and businesses selected by National Grid,‚Äù an international electricity and gas company based in the U.K. and northeastern U.S. While the program, initially budgeted at $45 million, was promoted as ‚Äúfree‚Äù to the community, ‚Äúthe cost of the pilot was borne by National Grid ratepayers,‚Äù according to the report, and costs reportedly ballooned to $60 million before the pilot reached the halfway mark. Testimony submitted to the state‚Äôs public utilities department and to former Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker presented evidence of the program‚Äôs ‚Äúmisleading and/or fraudulent results reporting,‚Äù including ‚Äúinaccurate misleading reporting of retention, opt-outs, and number of participants; inaccurate misleading reporting of cost savings; [and] inaccurate misleading reporting of energy savings.‚Äù Burke and two others petitioned the state legislature to ‚Äúestablish a special commission to investigate the results of the pilot program, which was over budget, behind schedule, and overran community and consumer rights.‚Äù Burke said she hopes the new administration will investigate ‚Äúthe actions of the department of public utilities, the investor-owned utility companies and others who were involved in the controversial program.‚Äù Utilities bring in tobacco scientist to testify that smart meters are ‚Äòsafe‚Äô In an attempt to override Worcester citizens‚Äô concerns about how smart meters can damage health, Peter Valberg, Ph.D., former professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and advising principal of the environmental consulting firm Gradient Corporation, in Feb. 2014 testified before the city‚Äôs zoning board.     Burke said Valberg also testified for the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in 2014 ‚Äî ‚Äúthe same week he testified for Philip Morris cigarettes.‚Äù Grassroots organizations, including HaltMASmartMeters.org and StopSmartMetersMassachusetts.org, said in an email to the public utilities department that the ‚Äútestimony by Dr. Peter Valberg of Gradient concerning the safety of non-ionizing radiation should be discounted in its entirety‚Äù because Valberg could not be considered ‚Äúan independent expert witness‚Äù and he ‚Äúdid not disclose a financial conflict of interest.‚Äù They wrote: ‚ÄúDr. Valberg has made a career misrepresenting safety science on behalf of the cigarette, asbestos, and hexa-chrome industries, and should be rejected as an expert witness on ethical grounds.‚Äù According to a 2016 report by The Center for Public Integrity, ‚ÄúGradient belongs to a breed of scientific consulting firms that defends the products of its corporate clients beyond credulity, even exhaustively studied substances whose dangers are not in doubt, such as asbestos, lead and arsenic.‚Äù Commenting on Valberg and other scientists with Gradient, Bruce Lanphear, M.D., MPH ‚Äî a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia ‚Äî told The Center for Public Integrity, ‚ÄúThey truly are the epitome of rented white coats.‚Äù New York‚Äôs proposed laws don‚Äôt go far enough, activists say New York‚Äôs latest attempt to regulate smart meters ‚Äî Senate Bill S2587 ‚Äî introduced Jan. 23 by Sen. Pete Harckham, isn‚Äôt the only legislation state lawmakers are considering. In April 2022, Harckham introduced a bill ‚Äî Senate Bill S8765 ‚Äî that would amend business law to make it ‚Äúthe right of every consumer of an electric corporation or gas corporation, at no penalty, fee, or service charge, to decline permission to their electric corporation or gas corporation: (a) to replace an existing analog utility meter at such consumer‚Äôs premises that is assigned to such consumer‚Äôs account with a digital utility meter; or (b) to install a digital utility meter at their property without such consumer‚Äôs consent.‚Äù Both bills are currently in committee and have yet to be voted on. On Feb. 7, Les Jamieson, a member of New Yorkers 4 Wired Tech, Odette Wilkens, an attorney and founder of NY Wired Broadband and Bill Bathgate, an engineer and certified building biology environmental consultant, presented evidence to the New York senate underscoring the importance of such legislation ‚Äî and arguing that the law should go even further. In their 34-page presentation, Jamieson, Wilkens and Bathgate outlined how smart meters exacerbate ‚Äî rather than mitigate ‚Äî climate change, why they pose security risks, how they are linked to adverse health conditions and how they can increase consumers‚Äô energy bills. Unlike an analog meter which has no electronics inside, smart meters are ‚Äúactually a powerful computer, not just a meter‚Äù that requires power from an energy grid to run, according to the presenters. ‚ÄúThere are special circuits that convert the AC power to DC to power the electronics of the circuit boards, CPUs, memory switching power supplies, LCDs, a solenoid and¬†many others functions, etc.,‚Äù they said, adding, ‚ÄúThose all consume power.‚Äù Jamieson, Wilkens and Bathgate said smart meters pose a security risk to consumers because they can be physically hacked and programmed using a special tool. This ‚Äúphysical backdoor‚Äù bypasses encryption, they said, allowing consumers‚Äô privacy to be violated by allowing ‚Äúthe insertion of code, altering the network traffic and injecting malicious code‚Äù that could possibly result in the power being shut down. There is evidence of smart meters delivering inaccurate readings, which can affect consumers‚Äô energy bills. Moreover, smart meters ‚Äî with or without the transmitting antennae turned on ‚Äî feed ‚Äúconducted emissions‚Äù back into the home wiring at the load panel and are not compliant with FCC [Federal Communications Commission] rules for conducted emissions Class A (industrial emissions limits) or Class B (commercial emissions limits), the presenters said. ‚ÄúThis is placing stress on all electronics and electric motors in the home, causing early appliance motor failures, appliance electronic control failures and radio interference, in addition to health effects such as insomnia, tinnitus, headaches, high blood sugar levels and nervous disorders such as neuropathy and heart arrhythmia,‚Äù they added. In order to solve this, they said, manufacturers would need to redesign the meter so it ‚Äúconnects to an earth ground path to sink the oscillations to the home ground rod.‚Äù A March 2022 technical test done by researchers with the Environmental Health Trust concluded that smart meters ‚Äúpollute the electricity grid‚Äù in buildings with more ‚Äúdirty electricity‚Äù than analog meters. ‚ÄúDirty electricity,‚Äù the researchers said, ‚Äúis an industry term for several types of electrical noise spreading through power lines and creating or affecting electromagnetic fields around them.‚Äù Because of this, smart meters ‚Äúhave the potential to be a health problem ‚Äî even when they are ‚Äòun-smartened,‚Äô i.e., with the radio transmitters in the meters removed or silenced,‚Äù they added. Opting out isn‚Äôt enough in urban areas, smart meter critics say Jamieson, Wilkens and Bathgate told New York legislators that while they supported Harckham‚Äôs first bill because it would provide ‚Äúutility customers with residential accounts‚Äù the ability to retain the use of their analog meter without fees, ‚Äúadditional consumer protections to a broader scope of state residents‚Äù are needed. They pointed out that an individual living in an urban area who submits an opt-out request may still be affected by the RF radiation from nearby smart meters. ‚ÄúThe meter RF signal can travel 1,400 ‚Äì 1,500 feet, right through a brick wall, making an opt-out program useless in an apartment complex scenario,‚Äù they said.           In their presentation, they wrote: ‚ÄúThere are many thousands of NY residents who own multi-family homes. In the interest of their rights as property owners, it is important that they be able to have analog meter choice for their entire property, not just the unit they live in. ‚ÄúThey need to be able to opt out for their rental units, and for accounts covering common areas within the building, such as hallways. Currently, hallways are designated by the utilities as being commercial. There is no opt-out choice for any accounts designated as commercial. ‚ÄúOwners of small businesses with accounts designated as commercial need to have analog meter choice. These include restaurants, and all manner of neighborhood shops. Owners and their staff spend substantial time in close proximity to utility meters. ‚ÄúResidents and pedestrians near buildings with digital meters installed on their exterior need protection from exposure to their RF emissions which are pulsed frequencies. This can be done with meter covers made up of a protective shielding material. Ideally, there should also be shielding behind the meter panel as well. ‚ÄúLarge residential buildings have large panels with utility meters. These panels with digital meters also need to have meter covers made of protective shielding material. If the location of the digital meters is adjacent to living space, there needs to be shielding behind the digital meters as well.‚Äù They suggested state lawmakers include these additional protections as an amendment to Harckham‚Äôs bill or develop them into a separate companion bill. Maine court rules against citizens who want analog meters In another recent example of citizens battling for the right to opt out of smart meters, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Jan. 24 issued a decision allowing Central Maine Power (CMP) to offer residents who apply to its smart meter opt-out program a ‚Äúnon-communicating‚Äù meter ‚Äî a smart meter that ostensibly has had its two-way communication module disabled ‚Äî instead of electromechanical (analog) meters, as an alternative to smart meters.‚Äù When CMP initiated its smart meter opt-out program, in 2011, the company offered an analog meter or a smart meter with the transmitter turned off. However, CMP later sought to revise the terms and conditions of its opt-out program, noting that a state commission had ruled that digital non-communicating meters posed no more risk than analog meters. The commission also found that analog meters are no longer widely available and that ‚Äúthe proposed changes to the terms and conditions would provide safe, reasonable, and adequate facilities and service,‚Äù according to the court‚Äôs ruling. Citizens with the Maine Coalition to Stop Smart Meters challenged the commission‚Äôs conclusions, arguing that CMP had an obligation to supply analog meters. They pointed out the ready availability of refurbished analog meters and the need for CMP to set up a program of rolling meter refurbishments. The coalition also argued that the commission‚Äôs finding that digital non-communicating meters are safe was not supported by ‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù and its decision to approve the revised terms and conditions was ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious.‚Äù However, the court disagreed, stating that the commission‚Äôs findings were supported by substantial evidence. Commenting on the Maine court‚Äôs decision, McCollough condemned the fact that state utility commissions are making life-and-death decisions when they don‚Äôt have the required scientific expertise and are too captured by the utilities. ‚ÄúThe problem with applying ‚Äòsubstantial evidence‚Äô review here is that the entire concept is based on an assumption that the agency is in fact the expert agency and is acting in the public‚Äôs interest ‚Äî rather than the public utility‚Äôs interest ‚Äî when that is not true in this case.‚Äù  Activist Post is Google-Free Support us for just $1 per month at Patreon or SubscribeStar       Activist Post reports regularly about ‚Äúsmart‚Äù meters and other privacy invasive and unsafe technologies. ¬†For more information, visit our archives and the following websites:  Children‚Äôs Health Defense Americans for Responsible Technology Environmental Health Trust Electromagnetic Radiation Safety Physicians for Safe Technology Stop Smart Meters.org Smart Meter Harm Smart Grid Awareness Smart Meter Education Network Smart Meter News Coalition to Stop Smart Meters EMF Safety Network Take Back Your Power The People‚Äôs Initiative Wireless Information Network  Become a Patron!

Instead, while we have been‚Ä¶ [+3476 chars]",Activistpost.com,"By Tyler Durden he Biden administration‚Äôs lip service about new IRS enforcement only being targeted toward the country‚Äôs wealthiest appears to be just that: lip service. Instead, while we have been distracted with rhetoric about billionaires paying their fair share, the Biden Administration‚Äôs IRS is actually looking to stock its coffers with the tips of waiters and waitresses across the country. This newly planned¬†targeting of middle-class Americans was proposed this week. Earlier this week the IRS proposed a new procedure to¬†‚Äúimprove tip reporting compliance‚Äù, as they so brilliantly put it. Fox News reported:      As part of the program, which wouldn‚Äôt go into effect until after a multi-month public comment period, the IRS could withdraw liability protection related to ‚Äúrules that define tips as part of an employee‚Äôs pay‚Äù from employers that don‚Äôt cooperate. The program can‚Äôt go into effect until it makes it through a multi-month comment period, Fox News reported. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax, told Fox this week:¬†‚ÄúWashington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Now, the IRS is going after middle-income families and working moms and dads who are just trying to make ends meet and put food on the table.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúMy colleagues and I have warned for months that the IRS would start targeting hardworking Americans in the Biden administration‚Äôs quest for more taxpayer dollars. Now, we‚Äôre starting to see some of these concerns come to fruition,‚Äù he continued. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., another senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, agreed. Smith said:¬†‚ÄúBank surveillance efforts, 1099-Ks, 87,000 new IRS agents to target taxpayers, and now a new program to go after service industry workers‚Äô tips are all a direct result of the Biden administration‚Äôs desire to tax working families and small businesses as much as possible.‚Äù     Smith continued: ‚ÄúMake no mistake: the administration‚Äôs many attempts at raising revenue are because they are unwilling to come to the table to address the debt crisis, which would require curbing their spending addiction.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúThe days of one-party rule are over, and House Republicans will use our majority to ensure hardworking families are not subject to higher taxes and more government mandates, especially not as they struggle under soaring inflation. Accountability is here ‚Äì the Biden administration has some explaining to do.‚Äù Easiest way to get your first Bitcoin (Ad) Rep. Michelle Steel, R-Calif, commented: When the IRS comes after you, it‚Äôs not voluntary. Families across the country are struggling with record inflation and fighting to make ends meet. The last thing waitresses and waiters need is to be targeted by their own government. Steel continued:           The House‚Äôs first order of business this year was to pass my bill to defund President Biden‚Äôs army of 87,000 IRS agents that were ready to increase audits on middle- and lower-income American families. This new rule doesn‚Äôt add up with President Biden‚Äôs claim that he will never come after anyone earning less than $400,000 a year. I strongly oppose this proposed rule and I urge President Biden to reverse course immediately. Mike Palicz, federal affairs manager at Americans for Tax Reform said the IRS‚Äô goal is ‚Äúto go and grab as much revenue as possible and from whoever they can.‚Äù Sourced from ZeroHedge Become a Patron!

But the annual advertising extravaganza ‚Äî a kind of competition among marketers that runs parallel to the American football championship ‚Äî features an array of beer and car companies, along with other familiar brands like M&M‚Äôs candies, which has been teasing its spot since last month. This year‚Äôs slate of commercials revives the cult hit ‚ÄúBreaking Bad,‚Äù whose cast reunites to pitch PopCorners chips, as well as a collaboration between General Motors and Netflix that shows an electric car navigating ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù and other settings from streaming hits. The spots garner top dollar, typically $6 or $7 million for 30 seconds of air time. That‚Äôs roughly 10 times the cost of an ad during the 2022 World Cup match between the United States and Britain.      Last year‚Äôs game generated $578 million in advertising revenues for NBC, up $143.8 million from the prior year‚Äôs telecast, according to Kantar, a data analytics and brand consultancy. This year‚Äôs game is being telecast by Fox Sports. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of money for a media spot,‚Äù said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. But ‚Äúwhere else can you get 100 million people to see an ad at the same time?‚Äù       The ads have become such as big component of the game in the United States that among ‚Äúa massive number of people, you have consumers who actively watch and discuss the commercials‚Äù at gatherings, Rucker said. ‚Äì Keeping it light ‚Äì Held each year in the dead of winter, ‚ÄúSuper Bowl Sunday‚Äù marks an occasion for families and friends to gather for several hours of competition, revelry and entertainment. This year‚Äôs game will be between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. As always, the show includes A-list half-time entertainment, this time headlined by Rihanna. Over-the-top ads are an old tradition and include such epochal spots as Ridley Scott‚Äôs minute-long commercial for Apple in 1984 announcing the Macintosh computer. The spot, which features a female athlete smashing a screen showing a ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù figure, riffs on the famous novel by George Orwell, concluding with a vow that the computer‚Äôs arrival will show ‚Äúwhy 1984 won‚Äôt be like ‚Äò1984.‚Äô‚Äù  Related News   Super Bowl: Philadelphia record three back-to-back championships loss  Super Bowl: Chiefs beat Eagles 38-35  Super Bowl: Rihanna performs hits with 'baby bump'    This year‚Äôs most anticipated commercial may be for M&M‚Äôs, which began tiptoeing into the US cultural wars a few weeks ago. On January 24, M&M‚Äôs, which is owned by Mars, announced it was freezing a publicity drive featuring cartoon mascots of the colored candies after the campaign was criticized as ‚Äúwoke‚Äù by US conservatives because of stylistic changes, such as the introduction of a purple character, a color associated with the LGBTQ community.         M&M‚Äôs announced an ‚Äúindefinite pause‚Äù of the ‚Äúspokescandies‚Äù and unveiled a new brand ambassador ‚Äî the popular comedian Maya Rudolph ‚Äî in a shift that was timed perfectly for grabbing public attention ahead of a splashy Super Bowl ad. Andrew Frank, an analyst at Gartner, does not expect politically controversial ads this year, predicting brands will navigate carefully in a divided country where strident messages can backfire. ‚ÄúThe antidote to backlash is humor, keeping it light,‚Äù Frank said.¬†‚ÄúI think they would like to deescalate all of the toxicity around culture wars and things like that.‚Äù ‚Äì Beer bash ‚Äì Last year‚Äôs game featured several prominent spots on the emerging cryptocurrency market, led by the then-titan FTX and its founder Samuel Bankman-Fried. Since then, FTX has collapsed and Bankman-Fried has been indicted for fraud. The fall of FTX and Bankman-Fried has created ‚Äúan appropriate time for them to take a pause,‚Äù Frank said. Countering that loss of advertising, broadcaster Fox can count on revenues from a wider range of beer companies following the expiration of a longstanding exclusivity deal with Anheuser-Busch, the owner of the Budweiser brand.       Frank expects most spots will go after ‚Äúleisure spending with lighthearted messages of escapist entertainment,‚Äù he said. The aim is to ‚Äúimpart a sense that everything is okay and that you don‚Äôt need to be so frugal about your discretionary spending.‚Äù AFP  ",2023-02-11

In Brazil, the new left-wing president is now requiring the children of recipients of the Bolsa Familia welfare program to have been vaccinated. Whether that requirement includes the Covid shots has not yet been made clear, but with the precedent established, this is a mere detail. That‚Äôs a stark reminder that it‚Äôs terrible to be dependent on the state for pretty much anything. Because as time goes on, it is likely to make more and more intrusive demands on us in exchange for its aid. Just today my friend Mark Jeftovic cited this example in connection with the topic of central bank digital currencies (CBDC). He was asking, in effect: if a government could use its policy of cash payments to certain groups to bring about behavioral changes in those groups, what is stopping the monetary authority from doing the same thing by means of CBDCs they control? The architects of these schemes try to pretend that they are responding to a market demand, pointing to the success of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as evidence that people are interested in digital currencies. What people are interested in, however, is not digital currencies as such, but monetary systems outside the control of central banks and national governments. So a CBDC is no answer to what such people seek. As we‚Äôve seen, a CBDC probably means the end of financial privacy. But more than that, is it really so unthinkable that a system like this could be manipulated for political purposes, and indeed to punish dissidents? Nobody before COVID would have expected Canada, as crazy as its regime is, to freeze the bank accounts of hundreds of people protesting the regime. But it happened. Are there any safeguards against a digital currency issued by a country‚Äôs central bank being controlled in such a way that, say, the digital wallets of a whole class of dissidents could simply be turned off? If the past few years have taught us anything, it‚Äôs that we‚Äôd better not give these regimes the benefit of the doubt, or assume that their various schemes won‚Äôt eventually be put to sinister purposes. So I strongly recommend you check out John Bush‚Äôs 5-day CBDC opt-out challenge, which he is offering for free. Yes, it‚Äôs already started, and yes, the countdown timer is at zero, but you can still join it and watch the replays. Let‚Äôs get a jump on this rather than be caught unawares: https://www.tomwoods.com/optout    The Best of Tom Woods   ",2023-02-11

They provide a governance model that enables DeFi projects to fully involve their ecosystems in decision-making and help direct their future. They facilitate easy on-chain governance, neatly delivered by blockchain and smart contract technology. With more than 10,000 DAOs estimated to be in operation, the model is now well-adopted by the industry. There is presently $12 billion locked up in treasuries, and more than six million governance token holders have been issued. Promising numbers. All of this gives testament to the industry‚Äôs adherence to its founding ethos of decentralization. The problem And yet, success remains limited for this governance model. There is a clear engagement and retention issue. Of the approximately six million governance token holders, only 1.8 million can be defined as active voters. That‚Äôs a 28% voter turnout.¬†Putting that into some democratic perspective in regard to national elections, just three countries in the world have electoral turnouts lower than that amount. Participation is key for a DAO to properly function as a healthy governance structure ‚Äì¬†just as for any democratized system. Seemingly, for most DAOs, value propositions and product market fit have not been properly defined. Community governance alone just isn‚Äôt enough of a product offering for most. DAOs need to be more There are three main ways to address these issues and bolster engagement and retention. DAOs need to be fun Being active in a DAO should be an engaging and interactive experience. Sheer governance alone is clearly not enough of a value proposition for token holders to participate at scale. There need to be added elements that make the user experience enjoyable. Simply put, a DAO needs to be fun. DAOs need to be easily accessible There exists a high technical barrier to entry right across the DeFi industry, and DAOs are not immune.¬†Being part of a DAO shouldn‚Äôt require much technical knowledge. Terms should be digestible with onboarding simplified. This is the only path to wider adoption and scale as an industry. Ideally, DAOs should even be leveraged as primary onboarding tools to expand project ecosystems. Done correctly, they have the potential to attract new users and introduce them to products/protocols. DAOs need to offer more For a DAO to be sustainable and maintain engagement and retention, it needs to offer more than just voting and proposals. A DAO should have a whole ecosystem under its umbrella, with many different community objectives. It should offer systems to token holders that are specifically aimed at marketing, product growth, onboarding and discussion ‚Äì¬†all with clearly defined growth objectives.

Dogecoins (DOGE) price looked be‚Ä¶ [+15904 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Dogecoin (DOGE): An overviewSource: Dogecoin.com¬†Dogecoin (DOGE) is a decentralized digital currency, initially designed as a playful counterpart to¬†Bitcoin (BTC). It draws inspiration from the widely recognized ""Doge"" meme, spotlighting a Shiba Inu dog.¬†At its core, Dogecoin is an ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù event that has ended up winning a lot of hearts! No wonder it is often referred to as the¬†people's cryptocurrency.¬†¬†Notably, DOGE does not have a limited supply. It rather has a decreasing inflation rate year-on-year. This property, as per Elon Musk, makes the coin a better option to serve as a currency, alongside its other benefits like lower transaction costs and better processing. As of September 2023,¬†141.18 billion DOGE are in circulation.¬†Dogecoin originated from the now non-existent¬†Luckycoin, which had forked from¬†Litecoin (LTC). This means Dogecoin adopted many of Litecoin's technical characteristics.¬†Like Litecoin, Dogecoin uses the¬†Scrypt algorithm for its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which is different from Bitcoin's¬†SHA-256.¬†Dogecoin started with a randomized reward for¬†block mining, but by the end of 2014, the network had switched to a fixed block reward. A static reward of¬†10,000 DOGE is given for every block mined.¬†Utility of DOGE¬†Tipping and microtransactions: Due to its low value per unit for much of its existence, Dogecoin has been popular for online tipping. For example, users on platforms like Reddit have employed Dogecoin to tip others for valuable content or insights.¬†Charitable causes: The Dogecoin community has been known for its philanthropic efforts. Historically, they've fundraised for various causes, from sponsoring sports teams to providing clean drinking water to those in need.¬†Transactions: Like other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin can be used for peer-to-peer (P2P)¬†transactions without the need for an intermediary. Its transaction fees have been relatively low, and confirmation times are faster compared to BTC.¬†Online merchants and retailers: As Dogecoin gained popularity, some online merchants and retailers began accepting it as a form of payment for goods and services.¬†Meme and cultural significance:¬†Arguably, a significant portion of Dogecoin's utility arises from its status as a¬†meme cryptocurrency. It acts as a cultural and social token within certain internet communities.¬†The evolution of DogecoinSource: Dogecoin/Twitter¬†Dogecoin was¬†created by Billy Markus, a programmer from Portland, Oregon, and Jackson Palmer, a product manager at Adobe, in 2013. Markus and Palmer initially didn't meet in person but collaborated to bring the coin to life.¬†The people behind the sceneThe Dogecoin Foundation is a non-profit entity established in 2014 to support Dogecoin's crypto journey, which includes its developmental and advocacy aspects.¬†The community embarked on several charitable endeavors using DOGE. For example, in January 2014, Dogecoin enthusiasts gathered¬†26 million Dogecoins, equivalent to $500,000, to fund the Jamaican bobsled team's journey to the Sochi Winter Olympics.¬†Later, in March, the community raised over¬†$30,000¬†in Dogecoin to build a well in the Tana River Basin in Kenya, providing clean water to the region. The foundation has the responsibility to prevent any forms of abuse and fraud while formulating a roadmap for Dogecoin's future.¬†Dogecoin's advisors also include the likes of¬†Vitalik Buterin and¬†Jared Birchall, among other value-adding individuals. A promising board alongside reliable advisors could play a key role in the effective implementation of the coin's roadmap and conflict management.¬†So, after all, the project is definitely redefining its purpose and becoming more than what it set out to be in its formative years. The foundation's catchphrase,¬†‚ÄúDo Only Good Everyday,‚Äù¬†further reaffirms intentions about supporting each other, being kind, teaching people about cryptocurrency, fundraising, having fun, making memes, and being absurd.¬†Journey so farAfter its December 2013 launch, it rose from¬†$0.00026 to¬†$0.0022 in just over a month, pulling in a¬†245% rally amidst its increased social attention. Then, after a rather choppy movement for a few years, DOGE has managed to reserve a spot in the¬†top 10¬†cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for the most part.¬†With Elon Musk being very vocal about DOGE's prospects to be used as a currency, the meme token gained surreal prominence among the tech folk, as well as in pop culture. This set the stage for exponential growth on the charts. In the first half of 2021, DOGE surged by more than¬†9,600%.¬†Can it Do(d)ge its way to the moon?Source: Dogecoin.com¬†As we saw, over the years, DOGE has evolved to elicit a roadmap to expedite its usefulness in the crypto space. Meanwhile, to serve this purpose, Dogechain has introduced decentralized finance (DeFi),¬†game finance (GameFi), and¬†non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the Dogecoin community to ultimately promote the usefulness of DOGE.¬†The Dogechain is simply the ""Layer 2 for Dogecoin."" By venturing into¬†decentralized applications (dApps), this community-driven project paves a path for the coin's increased utility. However, it is not built on the meme coin's network. Instead, it is based on a custom blockchain solution from¬†Polygon, known as Polygon Edge. So, in essence, Dogecoin‚Äôs developers or creators are not involved in the project.¬†So far, the results for this Layer 2 scaling platform are already quite impressive.¬† ¬†¬†Doge-ETH BridgeAccording to BluePepper, the organization behind the Doge-ETH bridge's development, this bridge will enable DOGE to move from the Dogecoin blockchain to the¬†Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain and back.¬†¬†The intermingling of the meme-coin in Ethereum's blockchain would make it useful in smart contracts, several DeFi protocols,¬†NFT marketplaces, and wallets with added features and nuances. Once the bridge goes live, the investor's perception of Doge's overall utility would likely be favorable.¬†Nonetheless, to create this bridge, there are some practical hurdles yet to be toppled. It was expected to go live before the end of 2022, but there‚Äôs no official launch date yet.",2023-02-11

""Change your thoughts and you change your world."" - Norman Vincent Peale 
The financial markets have gotten off to a hot start in 2023: stocks are up; bonds are up; gold is up; even Bitco‚Ä¶ [+27654 chars]",Seeking Alpha,"    spxChrome  ""Change your thoughts and you change your world."" - Norman Vincent Peale  The financial markets have gotten off to a hot start in 2023: stocks are up; bonds are up; gold is up; even Bitcoin is up. It has been the opposite of what we saw for much of last year, and, as a result, market sentiment has perked back up too. Inflation readings have slowed and optimism has emerged among investors that perhaps a ""soft landing"" that avoids a recession may be possible. The severely inverted yield curve and other leading indicators disagree and are not confirming that view. Risk-taking appears to have crept back into the market, with many beaten-down stocks like (TSLA), (COIN), (NVDA), and highly speculative areas like (ARKK) already up a significant amount in just a few weeks. The major averages haven't exactly taken off like rockets, but with the S&amp;P 500 up over 6% in this first month after the kind of year we experienced in 2022, it feels like a big move. When we saw the market transitioning to a BEAR market last year, what did we say? Don√¢¬Ä¬ôt fight the tape. That also applies to what appears to be a potential change in pattern. Whether you√¢¬Ä¬ôre a bull or a bear from a fundamental perspective, do NOT ignore that the technicals started to turn more bullish. While it takes months and months for new longer-term uptrends to emerge after the type of negative action we saw in 2022, we√¢¬Ä¬ôre seeing downtrends broken across large portions of the market right now and even in some of the most beaten-down areas like Tech and Communication Services. The formerly popular NY FANG+ index made up of names like Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Tesla (TSLA) fell 48% from peak to trough, but it√¢¬Ä¬ôs now up ~30% from its lows and has broken its downtrend after making a higher high and higher low over the last couple of months. All of that is taking place when just about everyone is expecting the economy to weaken. That highlights the market theme that everyone should know by now. Stocks discount the future and are likely to bottom well ahead of the economy and fundamentals. That is the reason why an investor can't dismiss the technical view. There are times when we have to put the horrible economic data aside and defer to the price action. As mentioned last week how long the glass-half-full party will continue is more than likely dependent on the earnings picture now. Earnings are front and center√¢¬Ä¬îand rightfully so. Over the last 20 years, more than 90% of the S&amp;P 500√¢¬Ä¬ôs price return has been explained by earnings. Therefore, accurate readings on earnings are incredibly important to determine the direction of the market. Since the earnings results we are receiving are for the fourth quarter of last year, the reports are effectively ""old news."" However, the accompanying forward-looking commentary from CEOs will provide us with valuable, real-time insights. So far there are a couple of ""themes"" being established.  Slowing Economic Activity Ahead, and Cost Cutting Needed to Maintain Margins  That leads us to see cautious guidance, and in reality, that shouldn't come as a shock to anyone. The poor fundamental backdrop remains a headwind for many sectors of the economy. For example, banks are increasing reserves on expectations of higher loan delinquencies, technology companies are citing broad-based weakness, cutting their workforce, and the railroads are noting muted volume growth. It is why S&amp;P 500 next-12-month earnings estimates have declined ~3% over the last three months, the largest decrease over that period since 2015 (ex-COVID environment). However, it's what happens next with this economic backdrop that the market will react to next. A bright sunny picture after this cloudy day, and the BEAR market turns into a BULL market. More clouds appear on the horizon, and the S&amp;P stalls at resistance levels and signals the economic growth party is put on HOLD. While investors will be trying to figure this all out, they will be swayed by the ever-present weather patterns that pop up from time to time, in the form of; Tailwinds  Strong Seasonal Period Downtrends Breaking Internals Strong Inflation Peaked  And... Headwinds  Recession Indicators Abound There Is An Alternative Short-Term Overbought  That said, I do not believe that equities are ready for sustainable upside quite yet. Here is the first problem. There is a disconnect that lies in Fed expectations. The market-implied fed funds rate bakes in ~50 basis points worth of hikes left (we just saw the first 25bps) in the first half of 2023, followed by ~50 basis points worth of cuts in the second half. I do not see that developing. First, it assumes inflation drops to near the Fed's target by mid-year. Secondly, I doubt the Fed will be hesitant to begin cutting rates and risk disrupting the inflation moderation so soon. They will want to avoid the stop-and-go policy of the 1970s that led to a prolonged period of high inflation and was very damaging to the economy. Thus, my original view of ""higher for longer"" remains. The result is a bottoming and recovery process that may be more elongated in this cycle. What we are witnessing now is a stock market that is adjusting to this different scene. The second issue I'm wrestling with is ""Valuation"". Normally I would be on board with the market moving much higher in conjunction with a full-blown economic surge accompanied by an earnings spike. However, that is the direct opposite of what is being forecast. The The economy is going to stagnate for a variety of reasons, the foremost being the weight of the recent rate hikes. The second reason, an overall anti-business, pro-tax, pro-regulatory scene that exists wouldn't suggest the next economic boom is around the corner. That would dictate any significant earnings rebound may not occur for a while, and as the indices move higher with earnings stagnated that means valuation is out of line with reality. Therefore, volatility is expected to persist and for the S&amp;P 500 to trade in a more range-bound fashion over the coming months (potentially between ~3700-4300). That is the view that I am working with today. The stock market has a mind of its own and perhaps it will look beyond the stagnating economy and maybe earnings won't be as bad as forecast. However, if that is indeed in the cards for this year then the major indices will flip into BULL mode very soon, and I will change my view accordingly. Either way, it confirms my strategy that selectivity as being key this year. Unlike last year, though, I see the potential for more opportunities in different market areas. We have already seen that in the first few weeks of trading. The Week On Wall Street All indices entered the week in an overbought condition. The S&amp;P posted gains in four of the last five weeks, while the NASDAQ was coming off a 5-week winning streak. On Monday, the dollar continued its counter-trend run higher and so did interest rates with the 10-tear moving back above 3.6%. That helped keep the selling pressure elevated. The DJIA was the best-performing index with a modest loss of 0.10%. While the NASDAQ lost 1% and the Russell gave back 1.4%. That reflected a move away from growth and back to value and defensive sectors as the only groups posting gains were Utilities (XLU), and Consumer Staples (XLP). More choppy action on Tuesday that was resolved to the upside and the trading patterns seen on Monday all reversed. Growth came back as the semiconductor ETF gained 3.2%. That rally was short-lived and it was back to sell mode on Wednesday. Almost all of the 52-point S&amp;P gain on Tuesday was given back as the index fell 47 points. One day the BEAR market is declared over. The next, it's deemed nothing more than a Bear market rally. That notion was reinforced on Thursday when the S&amp;P and every other index sold off again. Stocks posted a modest rebound on Friday, but enough damage was done to end the S&amp;Ps two week winning streak. All of the other major indices followed suit by posting weekly losses. The Economy It was an extremely light week in economic reports with no meaningful data hitting the headlines. Consumer Sentiment was essentially unchanged at 1.5 index points above January. Recent developments in the economy, both positive and negative, have led to mixed attitudes among consumers with little net change in February.   Michigan Sentiment (www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) After three consecutive months of increases, sentiment is now 6% above a year ago but still 14% below two years ago, before the current inflationary episode. Overall, high prices continue to weigh on consumers despite the recent moderation in inflation, and sentiment remains more than 22% below its historical average since 1978, and amazingly still below pandemic levels. The Global Scene German Factory Orders: December factory orders data in Germany beat estimates as a 15% surge in intermediate goods orders drove the headline beat (+3.2%); that included massive surges in order volumes for electrical equipment and batteries, two important categories to watch for decarbonization spending. Eurozone Retail Sales: Consumer spending volumes continue to trail off (-2.7%) amidst high inflation in December, creating a downward revision risk for Eurozone Q4 GDP figures. The Fed and The Yield Curve The 10-year treasury closed this Friday at 3.74%, which is quite a gain from the close on February 1st at 3.39%. It's one of the ""issues"" that has slowed the recent rally in stocks. The ""2-10 spread"" is at its steepest inversion in four decades. US 2-year yields are now 76 basis points above rates on 10-year notes. In the meantime, the Fed's preferred method to measure recession risk is the 3M/10Yr spread. This inversion remains very steep with the 3-month at 4.79%, it is now 105 points above the ten-year. It has been as high as 122 basis points. ""Nuclear Power"" and the Transition to ""Green"" - A case for Uranium Global CO2 emissions are not on track to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement: net zero (carbon neutrality) for industrialized economies by 2050, followed by emerging markets shortly thereafter, and there are reasons why that is occurring. Trillions have been poured into the transition with negligible results. Never mind that the targets are unreasonable, the strategy to reduce emissions is deeply flawed. The ""transition to ""electric"" requires the use of fossil fuels more than ever. Without a ramp in carbon-related energy use, there can be no transition. That isn't an ""opinion"", it's fact. Until the BULK of power generation is done without carbon-based fuels that FACT remains the obstacle to carbon neutrality. Until this ""issue"" is FIRST, recognized, and SECOND dealt with, carbon neutrality is a pipe dream. So far step one has not been addressed. In addition, the optimal approach is an √¢¬Ä¬úall of the above√¢¬Ä¬ù strategy. (i.e., using the widest possible range of solutions to accelerate decarbonization). One such solution is nuclear power, and it is as controversial as things get. So much so that the environmental community driving the transition is divided on the question of whether nuclear has a place in a sustainable energy mix. I'm not going to take sides in yet another, ideological/philosophical debate. If anyone is serious about zero carbon at ANY time in the future, given the technology we have today, it is THE solution. Yet because of ""controversy"", Nuclear is the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs only significant source of electricity that had zero growth, in absolute terms, since 2010.   Power Generation (www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html) As shown above, global nuclear generation in 2021 was essentially unchanged from the level in 2010. Bearing in mind that total electricity consumption increased 32% over the past decade, the nuclear portion of the global electricity mix declined from 13% to 10%. The plateau in nuclear generation reflects, quite simply, the fact that the global count of reactors in operation remains relatively flat √¢¬Ä¬î not just since 2010, but going back to the late 20th century. The count as of year-end 2022 √¢¬Ä¬î 437 √¢¬Ä¬î is virtually unchanged from 435 in 2010, and up only slightly from 416 in 1990. There is no secret as to why this has played out over time. The drawbacks to Nuclear Power have been presented by environmentalists for decades. They make valid points. Here again, I'm not here to debate that. What we know is by their nature, nuclear reactors have zero CO2 emissions. No other electricity source can match nuclear√¢¬Ä¬ôs level of operational reliability. Reactors in the U.S., for example, have achieved an average capacity factor of at least 90% every year since 2012, including 93% in 2021. Given existing technology, renewables are last on the reliability list, and therefore until that changes they cannot be a major reliable source of power generation. That leads us back to the original premise. Until the BULK of power generation is done without carbon-based fuels that FACT remains the obstacle to carbon neutrality."" Finally, nuclear ""wins"" on energy density (i.e., the amount of output per unit of area). The Department of Energy notes that all of the used nuclear fuel produced by U.S. reactors over the past 60 years could fit on a football field at a depth of fewer than 10 meters. Energy density is less crucial in the U.S. and China, where space for wind and solar farms is plentiful, but that too will eventually become an issue. Solar and wind farms are not practical nor achievable in densely populated parts of the world. This helps explain nuclear√¢¬Ä¬ôs high share in France, Japan, and South Korea. Japan and South Korea both have plans to restart reactors (17 by this summer). Where are nuclear reactors currently being built? The answer is overwhelmingly emerging markets, particularly those where governments do not typically obsess over public opinion. China plans to accelerate new nuclear projects to combat future electricity shortages, indicating that it could raise the number of new reactor construction approvals to ten or more per year. In 2022, there were ten approvals. It is clear some have received the right message, and are doing something about it. There is also some uncertainty about the pace of retirements that were originally announced as part of the ""Green"" movement in the U.K., Germany, and Canada. Perhaps common sense will enter the ""green"" equation over there. Small module reactors are the next generation in Nuclear, but there are no plans for any until 2028. So at the moment, it's NIMBY (not in my backyard) and it's zero carbon by 2050. Sorry, there is no cake for those with that flawed mindset. The green transition strategy has been flawed from the outset because it refuses to deal with realities. At some point, the environmentally obsessed have to fold their cards and deal with reality. Something they have shunned since the start of this movement. The ""Plays"" There are limited options to play the nuclear revival, but one way is through the shares of uranium suppliers, as uranium is the main commodity used in nuclear reactors. The uranium market is different from many other commodity markets. Like any commodity, it is impacted by supply/ demand fundamentals as well as funds flows, but given the size of the market, the concentration of uranium supply, and the political nature of uranium, large unexpected price moves can occur. Given that the majority of uranium (U3O8) is used in nuclear reactors, consumption is a function of how many reactors are operating and their output at any given time as the uranium required is an empirical function. The one exception, however, is when a new reactor enters production there is additional consumption required as √¢¬Ä¬úthe first core√¢¬Ä¬ù needs more uranium to start the process. Demand will depend not only on consumption but also on the inventory practices of utilities as many utilities keep an inventory of uranium as the security of supply is critical to the operation of reactors. Utilities may also potentially have a strategic supply of uranium which is partly dependent on their view of future uranium prices. If uranium is plentiful, and they perceive prices will fall, then they are more likely to keep a small strategic inventory. However, as in the past, if there is an unexpected supply shock (e.g., operating issues at a major mine or political changes) utilities get concerned about supply and not only want to buy uranium to ensure they can operate their reactors, but they may want to build up their strategic inventory given security of supply concerns. At the same time, holders of excess inventory may become less willing to sell if they also become concerned about the security of supply so there is less supply available. This psychological process adds to the volatility of uranium demand/supply. I've recently published a research report for members that includes investment ideas to follow the nuclear revival theme. From a ""technical"" perspective, all of the ""ideas"" reside in a short, Intermediate, and long-term BULL trend. That fits nicely with the strategy I continue to employ in this difficult backdrop. The Daily chart of the S&amp;P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) The BULLS look at the DAILY chart of the S&amp;P and will say that this week was a pause in the rally. They will point to the positive and mention the fact that the index held above a very short-term support level. That suggests this mini-rally isn't dead.   S&amp;P 500 (www.freeStockCharts.com) In the meantime, the BEARS will tell everyone to step back and take a real good look at that picture. For those that may not see it, they will cleverly point out that the series of lower highs seen since the BEAR market started is still in place. Another weekend where we can conclude that it's a 50/50 proposition on whether this rally continues. INVESTMENT BACKDROP From Stansberry Research The S&amp;P 500 just hit a triple bullish indicator (a positive return during the Santa Claus rally, the first five trading days of January, and the entire month of January) that's led to positive returns for the rest of the year 90% of the time throughout history. . ."" If you play probabilities that√¢¬Ä¬ôs a pretty good setup for higher prices. Whether that happens remains to be seen, but I think the probabilities and the ""charts"" suggest that this short-term mini-rally is the ""bullish"" path that I outlined for members a couple of weeks ago. There is a lot of attention on √¢¬Ä¬úgolden crosses√¢¬Ä¬ù right now but I don't rely on them to make decisions. A √¢¬Ä¬úgolden cross√¢¬Ä¬ù is simply when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. In other words, it means the average price over the most recent 50 sessions is higher than the average price over the past 200 sessions. You can go back to the DAILY chart of the S&amp;P 500 posted earlier and see what I am referring to. The analyst community and talking heads love referencing them, but in reality, they aren't telling me anything new, and they guarantee nothing. It's also a fallacy that all 'major bottoms"" have a √¢¬Ä¬úgolden cross√¢¬Ä¬ù but not all golden crosses mark a major bottom. The Russell 2000 is a great example. The index posted a golden cross in September 2008 but then went on to fall around 50% from that point before making its ultimate low in March 2009. Interestingly, the Russell 2000 also has recently formed a golden cross thanks to the latest market strength. So while I'm not basing my strategy on this ""event"", I'm not dismissing it either. The charts speak for themselves now and this near-term price action has to be recognized for what it is. We'll have to wait and see if this is the beginning of a change in trend. In the meantime that leaves both BULLS and BEARS wondering how to play this waiting game. U.S. Dollar The dollar's decline is a key reason for the strength in stocks with heavy international revenue exposure. US Dollar (www.bespokepremium.com) As shown, Bloomberg's trade-weighted dollar index peaked back in the fall and has been on a one-way trip lower, erasing much of the past year's gains in the process. Over the past few days, the dollar has rebounded, but the steep downtrend is still alive and internationally focused companies may continue to have some fuel. Add this data point to declines seen in rates and the stock market has built its near-term bullish case. Sectors Consumer Discretionary The Consumer Discretionary sector (XLY) was decimated last year. It's the leading sector (+17%) so far this year. The group remains in a long-term deep BEAR trend but the shorter term is looking better. I will, however, remind everyone that this price action is typical in BEAR markets. The problem is we don't know if this is just a classic rebound after a large selloff or the start of something more meaningful. If it is the start of a new uptrend it's sending a signal there are better times ahead for the economy. That dovetails with the message being sent by the Transport index as well. Consumer Staples Perhaps a ""tell"" on this potential change in the market's trend can be found in the defensive-minded Consumer Staples sector (XLP). While other sectors are close to breaking into a BULL market trend, Staples have just broken their long-term support line and have taken the first step in moving into a BEAR market. Energy I spoke about the Energy ETF (XLE) once again nearing a tough resistance zone and similar to past attempts the ETF has pulled back. The ETF did find support and is hovering near those levels as the week ended. When I assembled the Outlook for this year I mentioned that Energy would not post the same type of outperformance that we experienced in '22. It's early but so far that has played out. The year has started by continuing the sideways pattern we saw at the end of '22. It will be a year when select energy stocks can be bought during periods of weakness, and I would recommend staying with the dividend payers as the first choice. The Oil services group (IEZ) and the associated stocks do not throw off dividends like the ""majors"" (CVX), (XOM) or explorers (CTRA), (PXD), and (FANG). However, they just might start being recognized as a group that is in transition, and why I added them to the favored list this year. These are companies that will see their services in demand and their balance sheets will improve dramatically. While Energy stocks are having trouble breakout out to a new high, the (IEZ) just recorded one in December. I would look to add to positions during bouts of weakness in this group. Financials I'm always on the lookout for stocks or sectors that are breaking back above resistance and taking the first step in getting back into BULL mode. The Financials (XLF) just passed the first critical test. This continues to be a sector of importance and could indeed be the key to moving the S&amp;P back into BULL mode. We will soon see if this was a ""false"" move. Healthcare The Healthcare group outperformed in '22 and now we see money rotating out of 'winners' into the groups that took the brunt of the heaviest selling last year. The Sector (XLV) is back in the middle of its short-term trading range, and despite the selling, remains in a longer-term BULL trend. I would not be abandoning this sector in '23. Biotech It's not often we see a stock or a sector perform exactly as the chart pattern indicates. But, the price action in this Sub sector of Healthcare (XBI) has worked out perfectly. From a successful test at the bottom last June, to the rally that led to the consolidation pattern. Gold The chart of the Gold miner ETF (GDX) shows the pullback some have been waiting for. The problem is the fullback has broken near-term support levels. If the support range ($30) isn't retaken quickly GDX may have a further fall. Technology The NASDAQ and the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) have jumped out of the gate in '23 and for the moment have left the field behind. Like the rest of the market, its rally has stalled. I've said all along the technology area of the market has the most work to do after it completely fell apart in '22. If this rally turns out to be a false move, then there could be a lot more pain ahead for the group. Semiconductors Sub-Sector Is this another signal that suggests the economy is ready to improve, OR another case where it's a typical rebound after a large selloff? The Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) was wiped out last year losing 35% of its value. It has rallied 20% in the first 6 weeks of trading in '23. Like all of the other examples shown in the charts, it's what comes next that will determine any near-term strategy. ARK Innovation ETF If anyone wanted to know if the speculative areas of the market were involved in this rally, you need to look no further than the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). We've seen and talked about big percentage rallies in the ARKK before, but this time around the rally took on a different look. Considering it has easily vaulted the 200-day moving average in its first attempt, it is a much stronger (+43%) move than we have seen in the past. . That trendline has capped prices since November 2021! However, the good news may be about to end. The ARKK ETF already shed a portion of that move and it's struggling to stay above that 200-day moving average. A quick break below and this move will have to be considered an imposter. Final Thoughts It sure has been an interesting couple of weeks. Fed Day came and went, the market didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt have to think too hard about it and market participants just hit the BUY button. The resulting action broke the S&amp;P 500 out to a five-month high and provided further evidence in support of the √¢¬Ä¬úbull case√¢¬Ä¬ù I√¢¬Ä¬ôve recently outlined to members of my service. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and SBUX all missed EPS estimates and that didn't fluster the BULLS. Can you sense the change? Ironically it was this time last year that I called a turn in the general market. The strategy of ""buy the dip"" was changed to ""sell the rally"" as the BEAR market was born. From there it became a very cautious stance that relied on Energy and Healthcare to get us through the year. As much as I would like to, I won't be convinced and ready to declare an all our BULL market until the indices can overcome the downtrend lines that are still in play. We can see the mixed signals in the charts, and until there is more clarity and see pullbacks contained quickly, it's more ""wait and see"". Despite the losing week, the major averages are still extended. The S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ 100, and Russell 2000 are all well above levels that indicate a pullback can come at any time. Last week was the first step, but IF this near-term bull case remains on track, dips should be well-contained. If an investor is inclined to step on the gas now, they better know where the brake pedal is located.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gapped down‚Ä¶ [+15430 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"Disclaimer: The datasets shared in the following article have been compiled from a set of online resources and do not reflect AMBCrypto‚Äôs own research on the subject. Shiba Inu‚Äôs (SHIB) price rose by 3% amid the expectation that the beta launch of Shiba Inu‚Äôs layer-two network, Shibarium, could happen by the end of the week. This has helped cap a 10% rise for SHIB in the last 30 days.  Read Price Prediction for Shiba Inu [SHIB] for 2023-24  The arrival of Shibarium potentially marked a new era for Shiba Inu, in which it moves from being just a meme cryptocurrency to being a platform that offered genuine utility.      Shiba Inu, a coin that has since grown in popularity, was founded in 2020 by an anonymous techpreneur. Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin, both tech billionaires, have praised the project. Shiba Inu has been successful in attracting people who missed the Dogecoin craze previously. Investors seeking to join the joke have increased the popularity of memecoins, which are not supposed to be taken seriously. Shiba Inu has been known to be a disrupter when it comes to management and operations. The enterprise began with a supply of one quadrillion; its founder Ryoshi first locked 50% in Uniswap and then burned another 50% to Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. We are yet to know why this step was taken. Later in 2021, Buterin burned 90% of his Shiba Inu holdings and donate the rest to charities. He had earlier donated SHIB tokens worth $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund for India, CryptoRelief. He said that this was the only way he could avoid his transactions in Shiba Inu being read as actions. Buterin‚Äôs decision to burn his holdings, nearly 50% of the Shiba Inu coins in circulation, effectively put them outside the purview of the market since these coins are now stored on an inaccessible public address. Ryoshi thanked Buterin for his contribution to creating a decentralized financial system. Buterin has also praised the Shiba Inu community for supporting different initiatives such as the Fellows in AI Existential Safety. Soon, the memecoin will migrate to layer-2 following the Shibarium update. The platform also supports the Shiba Inu Incubator, facilitating a large group of creative digital artists who bring forth an experience of what feels like a decentralized movement. The NFT project gives support to artists in the creation, exhibition, promotion and auction of their artworks, besides providing them with other streams of income. In early August this year, the Shiba Inu Ecosystem announced on Twitter the name of the Shib CCG game, Shiba Eternity. It also revealed that the game would be available on both Google PlayStore and Apple AppStore. On 17 September, the game was launched in Australia and plans to venture into other countries.¬† The community is also involved in rescuing real Shiba Inu dogs through its association with the NGO named Shiba Inu Rescue Association. Skeptics are unsure of the future of cryptocurrency and memecoins in particular. While the mainstream cryptocurrencies projected themselves to be the alternatives to fiat currencies, memestream cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu were only poking fun at the former‚Äôs claims.¬† But as these memecoins got popular, they didn‚Äôt go in the direction of developing use cases of the currency. That wasn‚Äôt the intention either, neither did the community expect such a popularity in the growth of memecoins. There are, however, a number of merchants today in the US accepting Shiba Inu as a payment method. Another factor affecting the growth of the Shiba Inu currency is the huge number of crypto whales selling the memecoins. As per a report, whales at one point of time held $1 billion worth of SHIB coins. However, they keep selling and burning the currency from time to time, and now they hold barely a fraction of that amount.¬† The burgeoning cryptocurrency market proved to be pleasant for SHIB as well. The Shiba Inu community‚Äôs demand to get the coin listed on Robinhood Markets Inc. hitting an ATH of $0.00008845 in late-October 2021.¬† The second quarter of 2022 proved to be a bloodbath, however, with SHIB suffering. At press time, it was valued at $0.00001191.¬† Why these projections matter¬† As is evident, a sense of community is crucial to the growth of SHIB. Whether it is their demand to get it listed on Robinhood or asking McDonald‚Äôs to accept it as a mode of payment, the community has always rallied around the growth of SHIB.   I‚Äôm getting a Shiba Inu #resistanceisfutile ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2021  It has also become a home to a huge community of NFT artists who focus on the Shiba Inu breed of dogs in their artworks.¬† ‚ÄúRather than simply dismissing the hype outright, it‚Äôs important to realize that what we‚Äôre seeing is the mass movement of traders new to crypto moving into the space,‚Äù said Ben Caselin, Head of Research and Strategy at AAX. He added, ‚ÄúSHIB coin is a meme coin and embraces that.‚Äù As it runs on an Ethereum platform, it currently employs the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism and will transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 transition will also certainly impact the growth of the currency.¬† In this article, we will give an overview of the key performance indicators of SHIB such as price and market cap. We will then share with you what most popular crypto-analysts have to say about the future of this meme coin. This information will be complemented by data charts for a better understanding of the trajectory of SHIB so far and later.¬† Shiba Inu‚Äôs Price, Market Cap and everything in between During the crypto-bloom of 2021, SHIB‚Äôs price continued to soar and hit 0.00003503 in mid-May. Its price further rose by over 34% when it got listed on the crypto-exchange Coinbase in September 2021.¬† When the Shiba Inu community clamoured to get the cryptocurrency listed on Robinhood Markets Inc., its price soared to an ATH of $0.00008845 in late October 2021. The altcoin, however, was not listed on the exchange before April 2022. At that point in time, it even dislodged Dogecoin to become the most-valued meme coin by market capitalization. The surge also led to its mass adoption by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts.¬† As the cryptocurrency market crashed during Q2 of 2022, SHIB‚Äôs market price also continued to fall. From its April 2022 price of 0.000026, it fell to a little below $0.000008 by mid-June 2022. Since then, it hasn‚Äôt performed any better, sitting at $0.00001256 at press time, with a market cap of $6,908,753,147.¬† Source: TradingView However, one cannot disregard the fact that along with DOGE, SHIB has been responsible for a flood of meme-coins in the cryptocurrency market such as Bit Shiba, King Shiba and Baby Doge.¬† Shiba Inu Coin‚Äôs 2025 Predictions¬† Before reading further, we must understand that market predictions of different analysts widely vary. A good number of times, these predictions will prove to be wrong as analysts cannot always foresee events such as political or environmental crises. It is wise that an investor conducts their own research before investing in a cryptocurrency, especially in something as volatile as SHIB.¬† For instance, a Changelly blogpost claimed that after studying SHIB prices and market fluctuations, experts predict that SHIB could go as high as $0.00005048 and as low as $0.00004183. Its potential ROI for the said year is predicted to be 322%, with its average price remaining $0.00004335.¬† Telegaon concurred, finding that according to some crypto-experts, Shiba Inu Coin‚Äôs price can hit a new ATH in 2025. On the contrary, even though they expect enough tokens being burnt this year, they are not so hopeful about its price rise in 2022. They predict the maximum and minimum prices of SHIB to be $0.0001928 and $0.00009839, respectively. Its average price was predicted to be around $0.0001152.¬† Shiba Inu Coin‚Äôs 2030 Predictions¬† The aforementioned Changelly blogpost also mentioned that in 2030, SHIB will be traded at an average price of $0.00030921. Its maximum and minimum prices will be $0.00035649 and $0.00029857, respectively. The potential ROI for SHIB in 2030 is predicted to be 2,878%.¬† Now, there‚Äôs good reason to believe why SHIB‚Äôs price might hike on the charts. For instance, according to many, if users burn enough tokens, a cryptocurrency‚Äôs acceptance is bound to increase. That being said, the meme coin must cultivate a host of different use cases too.¬† And, not everyone agrees with whatever utility meme-coins like DOGE and SHIB might have either. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, for instance, believes that this asset class isn‚Äôt good for the market at large. In fact, it has often been speculated that these assets are part of a bubble.  Are your SHIB holdings flashing green? Check the profit calculator  Back in April, Finder surveyed a panel of 26 experts who predicted a rather gloomy picture for the future of Shiba Inu coin. They predicted that the average price of SHIB in 2030 will be as low as $0.000000325.¬† Speaking for a majority of the panelists, Dimitrios Salampasis claimed,  ‚ÄúI am of the opinion that all these joke-type coins will disappear and leave space for actual innovation and crypto-assets that can serve proper use cases.‚Äù¬† Source: Finder Fear & Greed Index  ¬† Source: CFGI.io At the time of writing, SHIB‚Äôs Fear and Greed Index was at the ‚Äòneutral‚Äô position. Conclusion¬† Shiba Inu Coin has continued to grow, hand in hand with the token burns. However, as its supply decreases and demand increases, its price should rise. Ideally. In fact, many investors have become millionaires by investing in this meme coin.¬† Shiba Inu has a lot of promising possibilities that will keep pushing the market. What also works in its favor is its extremely low price, which is why a lot of people keep buying it.¬† This July, Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama informed the users about further developments in a¬†blogpost. Progress on Shibarium, the platform‚Äôs Layer 2 protocol, is on track. The update will allow users to move assets with minor gas fees, facilitating micro transactions over Shiba Inu-based dApps. The team has deployed a host of new and innovative developers to build the UX/UI of its platform and web portals as a part of the same process. The post also informed that the developers are yet to determine the launch date of its beta version. SHI, a stablecoin, is also expected to be released this year. Kusama acknowledges that its development is a cause of concern now that other stablecoins have collapsed, creating losses worth millions of dollars. The team of developers, the post adds, is working to build such a coin that will avoid the problems associated with other moonshots. This will allow SHI to be used for transactions that need to be done without market fluctuations. An experimental protocol, more details in its regard will be shared once it is finalized. A new token, TREAT, is also upcoming that will be used as a reward token on Shiba Inu-based metaverse and games such as the Shiba Collectible Card Game. A limited supply of these coins is reserved for its most loyal Breed members who have been working for years to build public confidence in the entity. The post also announced that its metaverse and card game will also be launched in time.¬† In January this year, Shiba Inu Ecosystem announced the arrival of Shiberse, the native metaverse of the Shiba Inu community. As digital coins, games, virtual land and memes populate the Shiberse, it is bound to get popular among an audience that is keen to explore a brave new world beyond the confines of time and space.¬† Only recently, the group tweeted the news about Shiba Eternity, a collectible card game. The game is being developed in close collaboration with the legendary AAA game development studio PlaySide Studios.¬† What the enterprise is certain to face is a challenge in this space from Big Tech metaverse ventures such as Yuga Labs‚Äô Otherside and Zuckerberg‚Äôs Meta. It is difficult for an independent community such as the Shiba Inu Ecosystem to sustain the might of Big Money and Big Tech. The only way it can gain an edge in this segment is by introducing revolutionary ideas in the metaverse, gaming and NFT segments. So far, we haven‚Äôt seen anything new.¬† How the upcoming Ethereum Merge affects the growth of Shiba Inu coins is also to be observed. Among the most anticipated changes are the reduced gas fees and more transactions per second.¬† These are all crucial developments for the SHIB space. And, some would believe that the crypto‚Äôs price would be accordingly affected too. In fact, Finder‚Äôs panel concluded that, ‚ÄúHype is going to continue as the driving force behind the value of SHIB, with 82% of the panel saying memecoin hype will have a significant impact on Shiba Inu‚Äôs price this year. A touch over two-fifths (41%) see its inclusion on major broker platforms like Robinhood helping it to gain steam, with 12% citing the launch of ShibaSwap.‚Äù Source: Finder The trajectory of Shiba Inu is similar to that of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a significant factor that affects the price movement of Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu follows Bitcoin‚Äôs price like all other cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu‚Äôs price increases in value when that of Bitcoin does. As we can see, there is a lot of anticipation associated with the innovations brought forward by Shiba Inu Coin. Even so, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding its future. Investors should therefore conduct their own research before investing in the currency.¬† The recent takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk could prove to be a boon for Shiba Inu and other memecoins. Given Musk‚Äôs interest, it is highly likely that the social media platform is going to be more crypto-centric. Early this month, Google Cloud and Coinbase made an announcement about their relationship for Web 3.0 development initiatives. A select group of clients will also be able to pay for these services using SHIB and other cryptocurrencies. We‚Äôll have to wait and see if the decision is implemented and if other businesses decide to follow suit. Shiba Inu‚Äôs journey is similar to that of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a significant factor influencing Shiba Inu price movement. Shiba Inu, like all other cryptocurrencies, tracks the price of Bitcoin. Last week, Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama recently took to Twitter to ask whether the community desired the memecoin to collaborate with the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Metaverse global policy.  Crypto Twitter expressed doubts that the collaboration would cause the Shibarium, a layer-two blockchain that will play a key role in burning the supply of Shiba Inu tokens, to be delayed.¬† Meanwhile, as per a recent partnership between Binance with the Bahraini payment provider EazyPay, customers of the telecommunication company, stc Bahrain, can now pay their bills through the SHIB coins. Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous SHIB lead developer, hinted around Christmas that¬† there could be a new partnership in the works relating to the Shibarium project. Shibarium is an upcoming Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution that will host the ecosystem‚Äôs metaverse platform, games and a decentralized exchange. This could lead to bullish market sentiment for the coin.¬† Analysts speculate that SHIB cryptocurrency might retrace its recovery path as soon as it gets support from the level. However, volume change can be seen declining and under the influence of sellers. Buyers need to come forward to rescue the SHIB token from the seller‚Äôs grip. The imminent launch of Shibarium will eventually be magnified by SHIB: The Metaverse, a Shiba Inu-themed virtual world in which users can explore and own NFT-based plots of land (and various other items). It‚Äôs due to launch later in the year, and perhaps even more than Shibarium, it will help Shiba Inu become more of a full-fledged platform, rather than just a meme token.

Stellar Lumens (XLM) was trading‚Ä¶ [+18489 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Stellar (XLM): An overviewSource: Stellar.org¬†Stellar is an open-source, peer-to-peer blockchain network that allows easy exchange and conversion of digital currency with any fiat currency and vice versa. The network aims to integrate distributed ledger technology (DLT)¬†into traditional banking systems. Using blockchain technology, it facilitates easy, fast, and affordable cross-border transactions between any currency pair.The network has its own native cryptocurrency‚ÄîStellar Lumens (XLM), which plays an essential role in facilitating transactions. It serves three main purposes:XLM is used as a¬†bridge currency for cross-border transactions, which makes the network capable of exchanging and processing different currency transactions.It is used to pay transaction fees on the network.The coin can be used for¬†staking, and users can earn incentives for validating transactions on the blockchain.At present, the circulating supply of XLM is¬†27.7 billion. The coin is deflationary, with a maximum supply of¬†50 billion. However, the coins cannot be mined, and each time a transaction is made,¬†100 stroops (0.00001 XLM) are burned. In order to use the network, users are required to hold a certain amount of¬†Stellar Lumens. This requirement helps protect the network against spam and avoids accounts with zero balance.Unlike¬†Bitcoin¬†(BTC), which is used as a means to transfer value directly, Stellar was created to perform as an intermediary for easy currency conversions. It does not seek to replace traditional financial institutions but rather to enhance them by providing a single network for everyone to collaborate and work together.¬†How does Stellar function?Source: Stellar.org¬†The Stellar network is comprised of three basic elements:¬†Horizon API: This works like a web service that allows applications, online banking apps, payment services, and mobile wallets to interact with the Stellar network. The API also supports the creation of¬†Stellar Smart Contracts¬†(SSCs).¬†Stellar core: is connected to every Horizon server and maintains a copy of the digital ledger. It is responsible for handling the validation of transactions through the¬†Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which facilitates reaching a consensus on the state of the network.¬†¬†The Stellar core secures the public history of transactions by entering ledgers into permanent external storage and guarantees the non-duplication of blocks within the network.¬†Stellar network: This is the decentralized worldwide network of nodes that run the Stellar core. Each node is run by either an individual or an organization. The network is distributed, which safeguards it from spam and ensures its proper functioning.¬†To validate transactions, the blockchain uses a unique¬†SCP, which is based on the¬†Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm. This allows nodes to interact efficiently with each other to reach a consensus.¬†In order to reduce the transaction time and make the network more scalable, the network employs two important features:¬†Quorum slices: To validate a transaction, a node in the network interacts with other trusted nodes to form a web of trust or a¬†mini network known as a quorum slice. The node or validator collects votes from their slice to determine the validity of a transaction.¬†If the transaction receives approval from every node in the slice, then it is deemed valid. Stellar's network is reported to process up to¬†1,000 network operations per second¬†as a result of¬†the accelerated procedure.¬†Anchors: These are trusted entities within the network that enable the exchange of currencies on the Stellar blockchain. They are responsible for holding deposits and disseminating credit.¬†These features accelerate the transaction processing time and allow users to complete cross-border transactions in a fast, cheap, and secure manner.¬†Stellar's journeySource: Stellar.org¬†The Stellar project was launched in¬†2014 by¬†Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple and founder of crypto exchange¬†Mt. Gox, in collaboration with¬†Joyce Kim. At its launch, the network received¬†$3 million in seed funding from a payment company,¬†Stripe, in exchange for¬†2% (2 billion XLM) of the initial launch.¬†It was launched initially as a hard fork of the¬†Ripple (XRP) code but has since evolved into its own blockchain network. While the main customer base for Ripple comprises financial institutions, Stellar's focus lies in developing markets and being the currency for individuals.¬†Along with the network, the¬†Stellar Development Foundation¬†(SDF)¬†was also launched. It's a non-profit organization that supports the technical and commercial communities for the network, looks after the code, and publishes regular updates on the Stellar network.¬†When the network launched in 2014,¬†100 billion XLM were created.¬†5% of the supply was set aside to fund operations like spending or employee compensation, etc. The remaining¬†95% was set to be dispersed among various entities:50% was set to be distributed to people who signed up for an account.25% was allocated to non-profit organizations focused on financial inclusion.20% was to be distributed among Bitcoin and Ripple holders.The foundation also sought to raise the supply by¬†1% annually over the following five years. However, in¬†2019, the Stellar community voted to end this yearly supply increase. The current supply was also halved by 50%, which led to the maximum supply being capped at¬†50 billion.¬†Following a¬†ledger fork in 2014 that wiped back hours of transactions, Stellar revised its consensus protocol in¬†April 2015 and adopted the SCP. SCP was developed by¬†David Mazi√®res, chief scientist of the SDF.¬†Major developments¬†Source: Stellar.org¬†Some of the major developments/milestones of Stellar are as follows:March 2015: SDF held a¬†public auction for Stellars via¬†Poloniex and¬†Kraken.Nov 2015: Stellar upgraded its network, which introduced safety properties that secured the network against forking and reduced the codebase size.Apr 2016:¬†3 billion¬†Lumens were distributed among¬†Bitcoin holdersMay 2017: The network introduced¬†Lightyear.io, which focused on the creation of products and services on top of the Stellar network.June 2017: Another¬†16 billion Lumens were airdropped to¬†Bitcoin holders¬†November 2018: SDF distributed up to¬†500 million¬†XLM among users of the leading digital asset wallet provider,¬†Blockchain.¬†June 2019: The network upgraded to¬†Protocol 11,¬†which introduced improvements in transaction fees and network capacity.September 2019: Stellar partnered with¬†Keybase for a major airdrop, giving away up to¬†2 billion¬†XLM over the next 20 months to Keybase users.December 2021:¬†Starlight, a¬†Layer 2 protocol, was launched.February 2021: Stellar launched the stablecoin¬†USDC on its blockchain.

LBank‚Äôs CEO, Allen Wei, expressed his deep concern and sadness over the situation, stating: ‚ÄúOur thoughts are with the people of Turkey during this difficult time. We hope that our small contribution will help ease their pain and provide some comfort in their time of need.‚Äù ‚ÄúLBank is proud to have played a small role in this humanitarian effort, and we encourage others to lend their support in any way possible,‚Äù Wei added. As of February 8th, 2023, the death toll of the earthquake surpassed 12,000, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history. The situation is still dire, with many individuals remaining trapped beneath the rubble and rescue efforts being hampered by supply and logistical challenges. The earthquake, thought to have originated from the East Anatolian fault system, had its epicenter near Gaziantep in southern Turkey and was recorded as a 7.8-magnitude quake.  This was followed by a series of powerful aftershocks, with the largest registering a 7.5 magnitude and occurring 60 miles from the original epicenter. Some seismologists even consider this as a separate earthquake. While rescue efforts continue, LBank announced that it will continue to support those affected by providing necessary relief materials and medical supplies. The trading platform says it is working closely with local authorities and relief organizations to ensure that these resources reach the hardest hit areas and provide much-needed aid to those who have lost everything. LBank also noted its gratitude to the two non-governmental organizations for their support in coordinating and delivering aid to those who need it most. This donation is just one of many initiatives that LBank is involved in, aimed at making a positive impact in the lives of people and communities.

Solana (SOL) traded within a ran‚Ä¶ [+13481 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Solana (SOL): An overviewSource: Solana.com¬†At its core,¬†Solana (SOL)¬†is a blockchain built for mass adoption. The platform prides itself in claiming to be fast, composable, green, and globally distributed.¬†Its blockchain architecture is designed to accommodate smart contracts and¬†decentralized applications (dApps) creation. The platform serves the needs of an array of¬†decentralized finance (DeFi)¬†platforms and¬†non-fungible token (NFT)¬†marketplaces.¬†Solana offers a robust platform with impressive metrics. Here's an overview of its statistics:Active accounts:¬†Solana boasts over¬†11.5 million active accounts.NFTs minted: The platform has seen the minting of¬†21.9 million NFTs.Transaction speed: Solana ensures a seamless user experience with block times of just¬†400 milliseconds. As technology advances, the network speed will further accelerate.Decentralization: Solana's security is rooted in its decentralization, with thousands of nodes operating autonomously. This ensures data integrity and resistance to censorship. Currently, the network is fortified by around¬†1,964¬†validator nodes.Scalability: Designed for growth, Solana can handle around¬†4,000¬†transactions per second in practice. Remarkably, fees for both developers and users typically stay below¬†$0.0025.¬†Environmental impact: Each transaction on Solana consumes energy equivalent to just a few Google searches, resulting in a net carbon impact of¬†0%.¬†SOLSource: Solana.com¬†SOL, the intrinsic cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, plays multiple vital roles within its ecosystem. Here's an overview of its functionalities and significance:Staking:¬†SOL tokens can be¬†staked by validators and delegators to engage in the blockchain's consensus process. This act of staking fortifies the network's security, and as a token of appreciation, those who stake are rewarded for their contributions.Transaction fees:¬†Transactions executed on the Solana network incur fees, which are settled using SOL. Solana's optimized efficiency ensures these transaction costs remain competitively low.Rent mechanism: Solana has implemented a¬†rent¬†system for data storage. Accounts must uphold a certain minimum¬†SOL balance; failing to do so might lead to their data being temporarily removed from storage. However, these accounts can be revived later. This model ensures efficient use of storage space, reserving it primarily for active accounts.Upon its launch, SOL debuted with an initial supply of¬†500 million tokens. Interestingly, there isn't a set cap on SOL's maximum supply. The token's inflation dynamics started at an¬†8% rate.¬†¬†This inflation rate is set to undergo a¬†15% reduction each year, and over time, it will stabilize, settling at a consistent long-term inflation rate of¬†1.5%.¬†¬†Additionally, the protocol has been designed such that half of each transaction fee gets¬†burned. Consequently, as the transaction volume surges, it will naturally slow the expansion of the circulating supply. As of October 2023, the total supply of SOL is¬†558,983,589, and the circulating supply is¬†413,438,407.¬†How does Solana work?Source: Solana/Twitter¬†The network combines¬†Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with¬†Proof-of-History (PoH), creating a unique hybrid consensus mechanism. Its innovative approach to technology has gained significant traction in the market.¬†¬†Here's a deeper dive into how Solana works, focusing on its groundbreaking innovations:¬†PoH: Unlike other blockchains that rely on traditional¬†timestamps, Solana's PoH is a cryptographic way to verify the passage of time between events. This eliminates the need for every node to communicate with each other to determine the sequence of events.¬†Parallelization:¬†This refers to Solana's capability to process¬†multiple transactions simultaneously. Instead of transactions being processed one after the other, they can be executed concurrently, leading to increased throughput and efficiency.¬†Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): While the concept of BFT is not new, Solana's version is optimized using PoH. This ensures that the consensus achieved is both secure and fast.¬†Turbine: This is Solana's solution for the efficient broadcasting of information (like blocks) to the network. Instead of sending the entire data to all nodes, it breaks the data into smaller packets, making it easier and faster for nodes to receive and process them.¬†Gulf Stream:¬†Traditional blockchains have a¬†mempool where pending transactions wait. Gulf Stream, however, allows validators to execute transactions ahead of time, removing the need for a mempool and speeding up transaction confirmations.¬†Sealevel:¬†On many blockchains,¬†smart contracts are processed one at a time. Sealevel, however, allows for parallel processing of smart contracts, ensuring multiple contracts can run simultaneously without bottlenecking the system.¬†Pipelining:¬†Think of this as an assembly line for transaction processing. Solana's pipelining technique assigns specific duties to hardware, like¬†signature verification, to optimize the transaction validation process.¬†Cloudbreak: Databases often become a bottleneck in decentralized systems. Cloudbreak is Solana's way to¬†horizontally scale its accounts database, ensuring that as the database grows, its performance doesn't degrade.¬†Archivers: In Solana, not all nodes store the complete history due to the sheer volume of data. Instead, specific nodes called archivers take on the role of data storage, ensuring that the historical record is maintained without burdening every node in the system.¬†History of SolanaSource: Solana.com¬†In late 2017, Anatoly Yakovenko introduced the foundational concept for Solana by releasing a draft¬†white paper. This whitepaper detailed a unique timekeeping method for distributed systems, termed PoH.¬†Yakovenko teamed up with Greg Fitzgerald, a former colleague from Qualcomm. Their collaboration led to the creation of a PoH blockchain testnet.¬†By February 2018, they had released the project's official paper alongside the internal testnet. 2018 also marked the formation of¬†Solana Labs, which began its fundraising activities during the same year.¬†The team successfully raised over¬†$20 million in a private Series A funding round that extended into 2019. Solana's¬†mainnet was officially launched in March 2020.¬†Subsequent to this launch, Solana secured an additional¬†$1.76 million through a public token sale. This sale was facilitated by the cryptocurrency auction platform‚ÄîCoinList.¬†While¬†Solana Labs¬†remains the primary contributor to the network, there is also the¬†Solana Foundation. This non-profit organization, based in Zug, Switzerland, provides financial support for ongoing development. Moreover, it plays a pivotal role in fostering community-building activities for the blockchain.",2023-02-11

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 281,000 YouTube subscribers that while Bitcoin could drop further from current levels, it is likely to form a higher low rather than go below the 2022 low of around $15,500.         ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not completely away from the $10,000. But as the market progresses and we potentially start to form a higher low, even though this market could fall, come back and test $18,000, $19,000, $20,000 that could be the higher low that we‚Äôre all waiting for. For that sign of strength. The higher low is a sign of strength.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading for $21,643 at time of writing. According to Pizzino, hopes of Bitcoin falling to $10,000 will gradually disappear once the flagship crypto asset breaks above the August 2022 high of slightly over $25,000. ‚ÄúGoing back to these points here ‚Äì ‚ÄòBitcoin will go to $10,000‚Äô ‚Äì we‚Äôre still hearing that. But that will possibly and probably eventually fade if over the next month or two we do get this higher low and the market breaks away. Once these highs are broken [$25,000], the show‚Äôs over. There is going to be a lot of pain to investors who are still waiting for any sort of $10,000 or $12,000 or $14,000 Bitcoin, maybe even a retest of $15,000. Those possibilities begin to fade a hell of a lot as we start to see some more of these signals come in.‚Äù The crypto analyst says his bullish thesis for Bitcoin will be invalidated if the flagship digital asset drops below the $18,000 support level. ‚ÄúI like Bitcoin between this level of $18,000 and $22,000. I am losing hope for the retest of $15,000. Therefore, I don‚Äôt want to get greedy and wait for $15,000. So I will ladder back into the market in more of a pyramid fashion‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm looking at dropping more in on the way down. I think these levels are pretty good, between the sort of $18,000 and $22,000 because if Bitcoin drops underneath $18,000 then the structure changes. We‚Äôre dropping back below these previous support levels here ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs around $18,500 and then down to $18,000, there are those previous bottoms. If it starts to drop underneath these levels, then we are left with a different structure. It can spike under there, but we don‚Äôt want to see Bitcoin re-accumulate or start its price action back under these levels of $18,000. We definitely want to see it hold at least at $18,000 and start to work its way higher.‚Äù  I Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox   Check Price Action  Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram  Surf The Daily Hodl Mix           Check Latest News Headlines  ¬†        Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a spot of good news, unlike o‚Ä¶ [+18233 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Polkadot (DOT): An overviewSource: Polkadot.network¬†Polkadot (DOT)¬†is a multi-chain blockchain platform designed for¬†interoperability in the Web 3.0 era. Its core function is to bridge disparate blockchains, whether private, public, or permissionless, into a cohesive network.¬†By allowing data transfer across any blockchain, Polkadot introduces scalability and security and broadens real-world applications. The platform envisions a¬†decentralized internet¬†where blockchains communicate trustlessly, encompassing not only existing networks but also future technologies.¬†The¬†DOT token is the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network. It serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem, playing a central role in both the operation and governance of the platform. Here are the primary uses and functionalities of the DOT token:¬†Staking: Polkadot operates on a¬†Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism. Token holders can stake their DOT to support the network's operation.¬†Bonding: To secure a parachain slot on the¬†Relay Chain, projects must participate in parachain¬†slot auctions by locking up (or ""bonding"") a certain amount of DOT. If they win the auction, their DOT is bonded for the duration of the¬†parachain lease, after which it's returned. If they don't win, the DOT is returned.¬†Governance:¬†DOT holders have a say in the governance of the Polkadot network. This includes voting on protocol upgrades, changes, and various proposals. The DOT token allows its holders to influence the direction of the network's development, ensuring that decisions are decentralized and representative of the community's wishes.¬†The supply of DOT varies with each era. It has an¬†inflationary nature, featuring a set¬†10% yearly inflation rate, and there's no upper limit to its supply. This inflation rate can be modified via a referendum. The current circulating supply of DOT is¬†1,230,119,743.¬†The Polkadot ecosystemSource: Polkadot.network¬†Below is a detailed breakdown of the network structure and how everything functions:¬†TechnologySubstrate:¬†This is a modular blockchain-building framework developed by¬†Parity Technologies. With Substrate, developers can create their own¬†blockchains tailored to their use cases without having to code everything from scratch.¬†WebAssembly (WASM):¬†WASM is a binary instruction format designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web and other environments.¬†Polkadot utilizes¬†WASM¬†for its state machine, meaning that the logic that defines its blockchain (like how transactions are processed) is compiled into WASM. This allows for easy upgrades and flexibility, as new runtime versions can be deployed without requiring a¬†fork.¬†libp2p: Developed by Protocol Labs (the same team behind¬†IPFS), libp2p is a modular network protocol stack that allows building your own peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.¬†Polkadot employs libp2p for its networking layer, facilitating peer discovery and communications. It's a significant part of the decentralized nature of the platform.¬†ArchitectureRelay chain:¬†At the heart of Polkadot is the Relay chain, which is the central chain that provides security for the entire system. It handles consensus and finality and ensures that transactions across¬†parachains are consistently ordered.¬†Parachains: Parachains are distinct blockchains that plug into the Relay chain and benefit from its security. Each parachain is optimized for its own specific use case, which means it can have different structures and governance models. The Relay chain coordinates all the parachains and ensures smooth interoperability between them.¬†Parathreads:¬†Similar to parachains,¬†parathreads also benefit from the Relay chain‚Äôs security and interoperability. The main difference is how they are connected to the Relay chain. Instead of having a continuous, dedicated slot like parachains, parathreads rent slots on a¬†per-block basis, making them a cost-effective option for projects that don't require continuous connectivity.¬†Bridges:¬†These are specialized blockchains (or modules on existing blockchains) that connect Polkadot with external blockchains, such as¬†Ethereum (ETH) or¬†Bitcoin (BTC). They enable communication and value transfer between Polkadot and these networks, facilitating cross-chain compatibility.¬†Polkadot employs a unique consensus approach that's a blend of different concepts and mechanisms.¬†NPoSProof-of-Stake (PoS)¬†is a consensus mechanism where participants ""stake"" their tokens to become validators, which allows them to produce blocks and confirm transactions. The more tokens staked, the higher the chance to be chosen as a validator.¬†In Polkadot's NPoS, there's an additional layer. Token holders can become ""nominators"" rather than validators. These¬†nominators can select a set of validator candidates they trust. The role of the nominator is to back certain validators with their own stakes as a sign of trust.¬†This mechanism ensures that a broader community is involved in the validator selection process, making it more decentralized and secure.¬†Hybrid consensusBlind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE):¬†BABE is the block production mechanism in Polkadot. Validators are randomly selected to produce blocks in a rotating manner.¬†The ""blind assignment"" means that the selection of validators is unpredictable, ensuring that no single validator can monopolize block production. This randomness makes it difficult for malicious actors to predict and attack the network.¬†GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA):¬†While BABE is about producing blocks quickly, GRANDPA is about ensuring their¬†finality.¬†GRANDPA achieves this by allowing validators to vote on chains and then finalizing entire chains at once instead of one block at a time. This mechanism provides high levels of security and ensures that once a transaction is finalized, it is¬†immutable.¬†Roles within the ecosystemValidators: Responsible for validating and finalizing blocks on the Relay chain. They assess¬†collator proofs and produce and finalize blocks using staked DOT tokens.Nominators:¬†Back validators by staking DOT tokens. They enhance network security, support trustworthy validators, and earn a portion of¬†block rewards.Collators: Maintain parachains, collect transactions, and produce proofs for Relay chain validators. They facilitate accurate block validation.Fishermen:¬†Network¬†watchdogs who monitor for malicious activities. They report dishonest actions, serving as the last line of defense in security.¬†Interchain communicationPolkadot's¬†Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) protocol facilitates inter-chain communication, allowing diverse blockchains to share messages and value. By using XCM, chains within the Polkadot ecosystem can seamlessly interact without relying on central trust.¬†It underpins interoperability, supporting innovative cross-chain applications and over 600 projects in the¬†Web 3.0 ecosystem.¬†Governance¬†Polkadot employs an advanced¬†on-chain governance model designed to be adaptable and upgradable without forking.Token holders who possess DOTs play a central role in governance. They can propose changes, vote on referenda, and even elect members to the Council.The Council is a specialized group of DOT holders responsible for representing passive stakeholders, proposing referenda, and guiding the platform's direction.There's also a¬†Technical Committee, composed of teams actively building Polkadot, which can propose emergency upgrades or changes.Together, these entities ensure that Polkadot evolves seamlessly with the community's collective preferences and needs.¬†KusamaKusama is often described as a ""canary network"" for Polkadot, serving as an experimental, unrefined release of the Polkadot code. Its primary purpose is to provide a platform where developers can test new features and innovations in a real-world environment before they are introduced to the Polkadot network.¬†While it shares many similarities with Polkadot, Kusama has¬†faster governance parameters and lower barriers to entry, making it ideal for startups and developers looking to launch parachains or try out new concepts.¬†History of PolkadotSource: Polkadot.network¬†Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and author of its yellow paper, envisioned a multi-chain framework, proposing the idea for¬†Polkadot in a white paper in 2016. His vision centered around creating a web of blockchains that could operate interdependently yet seamlessly.¬†In 2017, the¬†Web3 Foundation was founded by Wood, Ashley Tyson, and Peter Czaban. This institution was instrumental in driving the research, development, and popularization of decentralized web technologies, with Polkadot being a focal project.¬†The following October, the foundation organized Polkadot's initial coin offering (ICO), which was highly successful, raising¬†$145 million in less than two weeks.¬†A major hurdle arose when a notable portion of the raised funds was locked and rendered inaccessible due to a¬†Parity wallet bug. This unfortunate incident delayed the development timeline for Polkadot. However, the team remained undeterred.¬†In the wake of the Parity bug, the Web3 Foundation orchestrated a¬†private sale, successfully raising the necessary funds to continue with Polkadot's development milestones.¬†In 2019, the¬†Kusama network was launched, followed by the launch of the¬†Rococo testnet in 2020.¬†Polkadot's mainnet was progressively rolled out, starting with a¬†Proof-of-Authority (PoA) mode where operations were overseen by the Web3 Foundation.¬†This was a preliminary phase before transitioning to a more decentralized¬†PoS mode, which hands control over to the network validators. In May 2020, it finally went live.",2023-02-11

In an emailed statement, a PayPal representative said: ‚ÄúWe are exploring a stablecoin; if and when we seek to move forward, we will of course, work closely with relevant regulators.‚Äù¬† The Popularity And Use Cases Of Stablecoins Stablecoins are digital currencies developed to keep a consistent value relative to another asset, often a fiat currency such as the dollar or euro. In recent years, they have grown in popularity due to their ability to combine the benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as swift and inexpensive cross-border transactions, with the stability of traditional fiat currencies. Image: Investopedia This makes them an appealing alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the fast expanding world of cryptocurrencies, the rising popularity of stablecoins has been driven by the demand for a more stable and dependable method of transaction. Meanwhile, the recent failure of several of the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs top participants, particularly FTX, has eroded investor trust in what was once considered the next big thing in finance. A halt in the creation of PayPal‚Äôs stablecoin follows a slew of recent regulatory actions against crypto businesses. According to an unidentified source who spoke with Bloomberg, the action forced the payments company to cease its pursuit of its own coin.

The price of Terra Luna Classic ‚Ä¶ [+10181 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Terra Luna Classic (LUNC): An overviewSource: LUNC classic community/Twitter¬†Terra, now known as¬†Terra Luna Classic¬†(LUNC), is an open-source blockchain protocol for hosting a dynamic ecosystem of¬†decentralized applications (dApps) and top-tier development tools. It is built on the¬†Cosmos SDK. The blockchain carves a path for the next-gen¬†decentralized finance¬†(DeFi) experience by harnessing a¬†proof-of-stake¬†(PoS) consensus mechanism called¬†Tendermint.¬†The network‚Äôs native token,¬†LUNC, is mainly used for staking. Apart from this, it can also be used for governance that allows users to make changes to the Terra protocol.¬†¬†It is also a payment platform for an¬†algorithmic stablecoin, and its chief role was to serve the purpose of a ‚Äúcounterpart‚Äù in absorbing price fluctuations of¬†terraUSD (UST), which is now known as¬†Terra Classic USD (USTC).¬†The attack that changed it allPost an attack that exploited a loophole in the blockchain's protocol, UST failed to aptly mint and burn its tokens to create a balance of its demand and supply at the¬†$1 peg. Subsequent to losing its dollar peg, UST witnessed a¬†catastrophic [almost 99%] loss of value, one that has gone down the history of major crypto collapses.¬†¬†The resultant events led Do Kwon to rev up the revival efforts. In doing so, he proposed a¬†hard fork for which the majority of the community members voted in favor.Thus, two Terra blockchains now function parallelly:The original Terra blockchain with the token rebranded to¬†‚ÄúLuna Classic (LUNC).‚Äù¬†A newly launched blockchain protocol called¬†Terra 2.0¬† with its native token called¬†‚ÄúLUNA.‚ÄùThe aim of¬†Terra 2.0¬†was to inherit all the protocols and applications of the former network. There was also a significant update related to the network's stablecoins.¬†¬†All of the original network stablecoins, including¬†UST,¬†KRT, and¬†EUT, underwent a renaming process. They were then known as¬†Terra Classic stablecoins, designated as¬†USTC,¬†KRTC, and¬†EUTC, respectively.¬†¬†Notably, the new blockchain iteration did not feature any¬†""Terra"" branded stablecoins. This distinction further differentiated the original from the new chain, reinforcing the legacy of the former while setting the stage for the innovations and offerings of the latter.¬†What does LUNC's road ahead look like?Source: LUNC classic community/Twitter¬†Community sentimentDespite the crumbling of its network, LUNC's community exhibited promising signs of revival as¬†‚Äú#LUNCcommunity‚Äù¬†was trending on Twitter.¬†¬†The community aided the coin's recovery by passing critical proposals on¬† LUNC's burn in the hope of recouping the losses of the previous meltdown.¬†While Kwon and his team focused on the developmental aspects of¬†Terra 2.0, Luna Classic was handed over and is now run by its community.¬†Effects of LUNC's burn taxIn an effort to redress the damages from over-minting, the community initiated a token burn mechanism. This initiative began with a burn rate of¬†1.2% for every LUNC transaction, aiming to reduce the supply from¬†6.8 trillion to¬†10 billion. The intention was not just to limit supply but to bolster its demand and value, especially in the aftermath of a substantial market crash.¬†Validators took a front seat in orchestrating this reduction, and their efforts didn't go unnoticed. A surge in social mentions and engagement, particularly on platforms like¬†LunarCrush, indicated a positive response from the community.¬†Major exchanges, namely¬†Binance and¬†KuCoin, stepped up, backing the burn mechanism, which, in turn, sent encouraging signals to other platforms to support LUNC's recovery. This amalgamation of social traction and exchange support set the stage for the cryptocurrency's potential growth.¬†Since May 2022, around¬†74.91 billion LUNC have been burned. While the initial burn rate was¬†1.2% per transaction, an adjustment saw it drop to¬†0.2%, aiming to invigorate blockchain activity.¬†¬†However, this rate wasn't impactful enough on the circulating supply. Recognizing this, a proposal was made in March 2023, and by May of the same year, the burn rate was elevated to¬†0.5%. As of September 2023, 5.82 trillion LUNC are in circulation.¬†What‚Äôs happening with USTC?The¬†Terra LUNA Classic community recently voted in favor of¬†suspending the minting of USTC. The primary concern was the¬†USTC-LUNA swap mechanism, which allowed users to easily exchange¬†UST and¬†LUNA. However, this method became problematic during financial crises.¬†¬†To safeguard investor interests, a proposal was made to discontinue this swapping mechanism. This proposal is essentially an attempt to restore the coin‚Äôs peg to the¬†U.S. dollar.¬†History of TerraSource: Terra.money¬†The Terra blockchain was developed by¬†Terraform Labs.¬†The company was founded by Daniel Shin and Kwon and debuted in¬†January 2018. Following its introduction, an¬†Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for its native token, LUNA, was conducted in early 2019. Terra's exceptional performance in the subsequent years propelled it into the¬†top 10 largest cryptocurrencies globally based on market capitalization.¬†Terra's white paper elucidates the vision of its founders: they aspired to actualize¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs¬†(BTC) initial ambition ‚Äì a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system. In their pursuit of this vision, they devised a unique approach using stablecoins.¬†¬†Before co-founding Terra, Shin's entrepreneurial journey included launching¬†Ticket Monster (TMON), a prominent e-commerce entity in South Korea.

The price of Terra Luna (LUNA) ‚Ä¶ [+15809 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Terra Luna Classic (LUNC): An overviewSource: LUNC classic community/Twitter¬†Terra, now known as¬†Terra Luna Classic¬†(LUNC), is an open-source blockchain protocol for hosting a dynamic ecosystem of¬†decentralized applications (dApps) and top-tier development tools. It is built on the¬†Cosmos SDK. The blockchain carves a path for the next-gen¬†decentralized finance¬†(DeFi) experience by harnessing a¬†proof-of-stake¬†(PoS) consensus mechanism called¬†Tendermint.¬†The network‚Äôs native token,¬†LUNC, is mainly used for staking. Apart from this, it can also be used for governance that allows users to make changes to the Terra protocol.¬†¬†It is also a payment platform for an¬†algorithmic stablecoin, and its chief role was to serve the purpose of a ‚Äúcounterpart‚Äù in absorbing price fluctuations of¬†terraUSD (UST), which is now known as¬†Terra Classic USD (USTC).¬†The attack that changed it allPost an attack that exploited a loophole in the blockchain's protocol, UST failed to aptly mint and burn its tokens to create a balance of its demand and supply at the¬†$1 peg. Subsequent to losing its dollar peg, UST witnessed a¬†catastrophic [almost 99%] loss of value, one that has gone down the history of major crypto collapses.¬†¬†The resultant events led Do Kwon to rev up the revival efforts. In doing so, he proposed a¬†hard fork for which the majority of the community members voted in favor.Thus, two Terra blockchains now function parallelly:The original Terra blockchain with the token rebranded to¬†‚ÄúLuna Classic (LUNC).‚Äù¬†A newly launched blockchain protocol called¬†Terra 2.0¬† with its native token called¬†‚ÄúLUNA.‚ÄùThe aim of¬†Terra 2.0¬†was to inherit all the protocols and applications of the former network. There was also a significant update related to the network's stablecoins.¬†¬†All of the original network stablecoins, including¬†UST,¬†KRT, and¬†EUT, underwent a renaming process. They were then known as¬†Terra Classic stablecoins, designated as¬†USTC,¬†KRTC, and¬†EUTC, respectively.¬†¬†Notably, the new blockchain iteration did not feature any¬†""Terra"" branded stablecoins. This distinction further differentiated the original from the new chain, reinforcing the legacy of the former while setting the stage for the innovations and offerings of the latter.¬†What does LUNC's road ahead look like?Source: LUNC classic community/Twitter¬†Community sentimentDespite the crumbling of its network, LUNC's community exhibited promising signs of revival as¬†‚Äú#LUNCcommunity‚Äù¬†was trending on Twitter.¬†¬†The community aided the coin's recovery by passing critical proposals on¬† LUNC's burn in the hope of recouping the losses of the previous meltdown.¬†While Kwon and his team focused on the developmental aspects of¬†Terra 2.0, Luna Classic was handed over and is now run by its community.¬†Effects of LUNC's burn taxIn an effort to redress the damages from over-minting, the community initiated a token burn mechanism. This initiative began with a burn rate of¬†1.2% for every LUNC transaction, aiming to reduce the supply from¬†6.8 trillion to¬†10 billion. The intention was not just to limit supply but to bolster its demand and value, especially in the aftermath of a substantial market crash.¬†Validators took a front seat in orchestrating this reduction, and their efforts didn't go unnoticed. A surge in social mentions and engagement, particularly on platforms like¬†LunarCrush, indicated a positive response from the community.¬†Major exchanges, namely¬†Binance and¬†KuCoin, stepped up, backing the burn mechanism, which, in turn, sent encouraging signals to other platforms to support LUNC's recovery. This amalgamation of social traction and exchange support set the stage for the cryptocurrency's potential growth.¬†Since May 2022, around¬†74.91 billion LUNC have been burned. While the initial burn rate was¬†1.2% per transaction, an adjustment saw it drop to¬†0.2%, aiming to invigorate blockchain activity.¬†¬†However, this rate wasn't impactful enough on the circulating supply. Recognizing this, a proposal was made in March 2023, and by May of the same year, the burn rate was elevated to¬†0.5%. As of September 2023, 5.82 trillion LUNC are in circulation.¬†What‚Äôs happening with USTC?The¬†Terra LUNA Classic community recently voted in favor of¬†suspending the minting of USTC. The primary concern was the¬†USTC-LUNA swap mechanism, which allowed users to easily exchange¬†UST and¬†LUNA. However, this method became problematic during financial crises.¬†¬†To safeguard investor interests, a proposal was made to discontinue this swapping mechanism. This proposal is essentially an attempt to restore the coin‚Äôs peg to the¬†U.S. dollar.¬†History of TerraSource: Terra.money¬†The Terra blockchain was developed by¬†Terraform Labs.¬†The company was founded by Daniel Shin and Kwon and debuted in¬†January 2018. Following its introduction, an¬†Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for its native token, LUNA, was conducted in early 2019. Terra's exceptional performance in the subsequent years propelled it into the¬†top 10 largest cryptocurrencies globally based on market capitalization.¬†Terra's white paper elucidates the vision of its founders: they aspired to actualize¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs¬†(BTC) initial ambition ‚Äì a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system. In their pursuit of this vision, they devised a unique approach using stablecoins.¬†¬†Before co-founding Terra, Shin's entrepreneurial journey included launching¬†Ticket Monster (TMON), a prominent e-commerce entity in South Korea. He later co-initiated Fast Track Asia, an incubator assisting entrepreneurs in sculpting their fledgling companies into robust enterprises.¬†On the other hand, Kwon's resume boasts the founding of Anyfi, a startup dedicated to decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions.

Since reaching an all-time high ‚Ä¶ [+15244 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Algorand (ALGO): An overviewSource: Algorand/Twitter¬†Algorand (ALGO) is a decentralized, public blockchain platform designed to address some of the main challenges faced by legacy blockchain systems, particularly in terms of scalability, security, and decentralization.¬†The blockchain platform aims to create a¬†borderless economy where everyone can participate equitably and transparently. To achieve this, Algorand offers a plethora of features:¬†Scalability: Algorand is built to handle a high throughput of transactions, rivaling major global payment gateways. This scalability ensures that as adoption grows, the network remains efficient.¬†¬†On Algorand, every¬†3.3 seconds, a block is generated, accommodating up to 25,000 transactions. This leads to a transaction capacity of approximately¬†7,500 transactions per second (TPS).¬†Smart contracts: While also offering smart contract functionality, Algorand opens doorways for¬†decentralized applications¬†(dApps). This function makes the blockchain useful for financial services,¬†decentralized finance (DeFi), institutions, and ultimately for the users.¬†Atomic swaps: Additionally, atomic swaps allow for instantaneous cross-chain exchanges, increasing interoperability.¬†Two-tiered structure:¬†Algorand employs a dual-layer¬†blockchain architecture to balance rapid performance with the demands of complex applications. The foundational layer,¬†Layer 1, facilitates the creation of¬†Algorand Standard Assets (ASA), which can represent novel or pre-existing tokens on the chain, as well as enable atomic swaps and basic smart contracts on Algorand.¬†On the other hand, the advanced¬†Layer 2 is tailored for intricate smart contracts and¬†dApps that operate off-chain.¬†Developer tools: For developers, Algorand offers the flexibility to author smart contracts using Python. Additionally, to integrate with on-chain assets or applications, they can choose from one of the four available SDKs:¬†Python,¬†JavaScript,¬†Golang, or¬†Java.¬†Open-source nature: The Algorand protocol is entirely¬†open-source. This transparency fosters innovation and community collaboration and ensures the platform's trustworthiness and adaptability for future technological advancements.¬†ALGOSource: Algorand/Twitter¬†ALGO is the native coin of Algorand's blockchain. As a versatile coin within the crypto space, it has several use cases:Transaction fees:¬†The coin is used to pay transaction fees on the Algorand network.On-chain purchases: ALGO is used for buying on-chain items, including¬†non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Goods and services: It is used as a form of payment for various goods and services.DeFi: ALGO holders can participate in various¬†DeFi activities, both as users and investors.Governance participation: Holders of ALGO can participate in the governance of the Algorand network, making decisions about its future direction.Consensus mechanism:¬†ALGO is also essential for securing consensus among participation nodes.The maximum supply for ALGO is fixed at¬†10 billion. Even though all coins were pre-minted¬†at the network's inception, the circulating supply will gradually increase as these pre-minted coins are unlocked and distributed over time. As of September 2023,¬†7,832,296,592 ALGOs are in circulation.¬†Q1 2023 signified the¬†Algorand Governance Period 6. During this period, governors decided on the allocation of¬†68.2 million ALGO, split as follows:General governance:¬†53.2 million ALGOGeneral DeFi rewards:¬†15.0 million ALGOTo ensure sustainable growth and a transparent future, the¬†Algorand Foundation introduced a revised long-term¬†Algo Dynamics model. This model is intended to guide the platform's progress over a period extending beyond a decade, potentially up to the year¬†2030.¬†How does Algorand work?Source: Algorand.com¬†Algorand operates using a unique approach that stands out in the blockchain space, primarily leveraging its¬†Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism and its dual-node structure comprising relay and participation nodes.¬†PPoS¬†Unlike¬†Proof-of-Work (PoW), which involves computational puzzles, Algorand uses the unique PPoS algorithm.¬†For each round of block generation, a committee of token holders is randomly selected to propose and validate a block. The likelihood of being chosen relates to the number of ALGOs¬†they hold. This selection process is secretive, minimizing the risk of attacks.¬†Once a block is added to the chain in Algorand, it's final. This eliminates¬†forks and provides certainty about transactions.¬†Relay nodesRelay nodes serve as the primary¬†communication infrastructure¬†for the network. They are responsible for transferring data (like transactions and blocks) efficiently across the network.¬†Relay nodes connect to multiple other nodes, both relay and participation, ensuring data propagates rapidly and reliably.¬†Participation nodesThese nodes actively participate in the PPoS consensus process. They can be chosen to¬†propose a block or to be part of the committee that¬†validates and¬†votes on a block.¬†Participation nodes predominantly communicate with the network through relay nodes, acting as a second layer that engages directly in the consensus process.¬†Algorand‚Äôs journeySource: Algorand.foundation¬†The primary inventor behind Algorand is Silvio Micali, a Turing Award-winning cryptographer and a professor at MIT. Micali co-authored the Algorand¬†white paper with Jing Chen in 2017.¬†The¬†Algorand Foundation, based in Singapore, has been the primary force in supporting and funding the research and advancement of the Algorand protocol. In 2019, Algorand's¬†mainnet¬†was launched, and its first auction took place, marking the beginning of its public existence.¬†In September 2021, the blockchain announced the launch of its Layer 1 protocol:¬†Algorand Virtual Machine.¬†In the following November, the momentum continued as the network witnessed the introduction of¬†Algomint, the next-generation DeFi infrastructure. This project bridged popular assets to and from other blockchains to the Algorand blockchain.",2023-02-11

Using¬†distributed ledger technology (DLT),¬†VeChain aims to enhance business processes and promote the mass adoption of blockchain technology. The VET tokens serve as the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain.¬†Like many other cryptocurrencies, the maximum supply of VET coins is capped at¬†86.71 billion VET. Currently, there are¬†72.71 billion VET in circulation. These coins are used for transactions, executing smart contracts, and other functions on the blockchain.¬†Even after being a significant technological advancement,¬†Ethereum (ETH) still remains incapable of running¬†large-scale commercial decentralized applications (dApps). Also, the lack of a suitable economic model proves to be a barrier for companies looking to operate their dApps at a controlled and predictable cost.¬†To address these issues,¬†VeChain uses an on-chain governance mechanism, meta-transaction features, a¬†proof-of-authority¬†(PoA)¬†consensus mechanism, and a unique two-token system.The community-elected¬†steering committee supports the on-chain governance process by facilitating decision-making and execution. Nodeholders vote openly to choose the committee.Meta-transaction features include multi-party payment, multi-task transaction, controllable transaction lifecycle, and transaction dependency.PoA solves the numerous problems with energy waste and inefficient renovations that businesses encounter. It helps process large transaction volumes rapidly and can avoid hard forks if they are not upgraded by¬†authority masternodes.¬†There are¬†101 masternodes on the blockchain.The unique two-token system (VET+VTHO) significantly helps to isolate the price volatility and separate the cost of using blockchain from market speculation. Value is stored and transferred using VET, while blockchain transactions are made using VTHO.The blockchain is also highly scalable and sustainable.¬†VeChain Thor allows a transaction to carry out multiple tasks or clauses to promote scalability and facilitate complex transactions. The energy consumption is also equal to¬†0.04% of other blockchains.¬†VeChain's journeySource: Vechain.org¬†Sunny Lu, a former chief information officer for Louis Vuitton China, and Jay Zhang co-founded VeChain in¬†2015. It was founded as a subsidiary of¬†Bitse, one of the biggest blockchain businesses in China, and is one of the few blockchains having a significant base of established businesses as customers.¬†Initially, the VEN token operated on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2017, the VeChain team held a crowd sale in which it sold¬†1 billion¬†coins and raised $20 million, distributing its cryptocurrency,¬†VEN, for the first time.¬†The VeChain protocol, which was initially only intended to address supply chain management, was rebranded to¬†VeChain Thor‚Äîa blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform in¬†2018. This rebranding expanded the range of dApps to cover more general data solutions.¬†When the rebranded blockchain was introduced, the tokens were later replaced with¬†VET coins. The coming developments were called the¬†Apotheosis by the¬†VeChain Foundation, during which they expected VeChain to reach new highs.¬†The blockchain platform's objectives are outlined in its white paper. Its primary goal was to upend the supply chain sector by making data transparent and usable. It also intends to be a pioneer in VeChain-based dApps and initial coin offerings (ICOs), as well as an¬†Internet of Things (IoT) intermediary.In February 2023, VeChain announced the launch of its new fully¬†decentralized crypto wallet: VeWorld. This wallet allows users to carry out a number of crypto-related tasks, including maintaining crypto portfolios, transferring and receiving crypto assets, securely transacting on decentralized applications, and managing crypto in conjunction with a Ledger hardware device.¬†How does VeChain function?With the use of¬†RFID (radio frequency identification),¬†QR Codes,¬†or NFC, VeChain enables the identification of physical items with a unique identity. Sensors gather information, which is then collected and linked to the product identity at every stage of the supply chain. These sensors are produced by companies like¬†Bosch¬†and¬†Qualcomm.¬†Since it employs blockchain technology, the data becomes immutable. The blockchain record also identifies the precise location of any errors with regard to the location, authenticity, etc. Information on the product can be viewed on VeChain by both the company and the customer.¬†These features are crucial for combating fraud. The sensors or chips are assigned unique IDs or QR codes. They are then inserted inside products, which can be scanned to access all the information from production to delivery. Even after a certain item is sold, the chip remains and enables reselling and verification of authentic items.¬†The blockchain uses a two-token system. Both of these coins are crucial for it to operate:VET is the native cryptocurrency and serves as a value-transfer medium. By keeping VET coins in their wallets, holders can also earn VTHO. The amount of VTHO received depends on the quantity of VET retained and the length of the holding period. When it comes to leveraging the resources of the blockchain, the more VET a person or business possesses the greater priority.VTHO is a secondary token that is used to cover the cost of executing transactions and smart contracts. In the VeChainThor blockchain, VTHO is used to pay transaction fees and is burnt when the transaction is completed.¬†Other developments¬†Source: Vechain.org¬†Some of the important developments/milestones of VeChain are as follows:April 2019: The platform launched¬†Toolchain, a blockchain-based platform for businesses to develop their own supply chain solutions.July 2021: With¬†VIP-193 completely operational, the VeChain Foundation launched its brand-new public testnet.

Giv‚Ä¶ [+1020 chars]",Investing.com,"By Nikunj Ohri (Reuters) - The Group of 20 (G20) big economies is exploring whether the group could collectively regulate cryptocurrencies, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday. Given the sophisticated technologies involved with these virtual assets, countries must discuss whether a given regulation is needed, said Sitharaman, whose country is this year's G20 president. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has for several years debated drafting a law to regulate or even ban cryptocurrencies but has not made a final decision. ""We are talking to all nations, that if it requires regulation, then one country alone cannot do anything,"" Sitharaman told reporters after meeting the central bank's directors in New Delhi. ""We are talking with all nations, if we can make some standard operating procedure which is followed by everyone to make a regulatory framework, and if it can be effective.  India will host G20 finance ministers and central bank governors this month. Last year, Modi has said a collective global effort is needed to deal with problems posed by cryptocurrencies. The Reserve Bank of India has said that cryptocurrencies should be banned as they are akin to a Ponzi scheme.    ",2023-02-11

The anonymous host of the InvestAnswers channel tells his 441,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that the blockchain data indexing protocol, The Graph (GRT), is the massively dominant search engine of decentralized networks.         ‚ÄúNow [The] Graph got my attention over two years ago because it is the Google of blockchain and Web3 needs transparency.‚Äù According to the InvestAnswers‚Äô host, The Graph could surge by around 521% from current levels during the next bull season. ‚ÄúI believe The Graph could go over $1 for the next bull run. And remember, that could start six months from now, 14 months from now, or a year and a half from now.  But I do believe it will go over $1 which is a 7X from the current price, which is kind of crazy to think. It‚Äôs risky, but the rewards are there.‚Äù The Graph is worth $0.161 at time of writing. The host of InvestAnswers, however, says that investors should avoid putting their money on the blockchain data indexing protocol based on a fear of missing out (FOMO). The Graph is up by over 200% since November of 2022 when it hit an all-time low of $0.052. ‚Äú[The Graph] took a huge run. It‚Äôs gone up to 3x in a very short window of time. It‚Äôs coming back off of that euphoria as with all the other names going up 800%, 900%. So not financial advice, but sit tight.

Some of the emerging roles of the text-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool include offering specific crypto price predictions and writing songs with lyrics covering diverse themes and genres.¬† Indeed, Finbold tasked ChatGPT with the role of explaining Bitcoin (BTC) in the form of rap music. As it stands, the tool did not disappoint by compressing all information about Bitcoin to align with the features of rap music.¬† In its explanation, ChatGPT incorporated elements such as rhyme schemes, repetition to emphasize certain points, and storytelling to creative wordplay.¬† Rapping about Bitcoin      At the start, the AI tool made it clear it was about to tell a story about Bitcoin, stressing that the asset is a real deal and not just a ‚Äògame‚Äô:  ‚ÄúListen up, y‚Äôall I got a story to tell About a currency that‚Äôs making waves doing well It‚Äôs called Bitcoin, and it‚Äôs changing the game A decentralized system with no one to blame‚Äù  For the chorus, ChatGPT summed up Bitcoin as secure, with no possibility of third-party interference, while noting that the maiden crypto is the ‚Äòfuture of gains‚Äô. ChatGPT Bitcoin rap lyrics. Source: ChatGPT Under the second verse, the AI tool opted to offer a history lesson on the emergence of Bitcoin, highlighting the year of creation and the anonymity around the asset‚Äôs innovator:  ‚ÄúIt started in 2009, with a mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the name of the innovator¬† The idea was simple, create a new coin A digital currency that can easily be joined‚Äù  Furthemore, ChatGPT used its lyrical prowess to give a word of caution for investors hoping to get rich quickly by buying Bitcoin. The tool warned that crypto markets remain highly volatile and caution should be observed:  ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not all sunshine, it‚Äôs a volatile ride It can go up and down, you gotta hold on tight But it‚Äôs a long-term play, not a get-rich-quick scheme Invest wisely, and you can make your dreams come true, it seems‚Äù  Finally, for the outro, ChatGPTs‚Äô Bitcoin rap sums up everything by advising on investing in the crypto and joining the revolution:¬†  ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the story of Bitcoin, a currency of the future, Join the revolution, don‚Äôt be a loser, Invest wisely, and see your wealth grow, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, it‚Äôs the way to go‚Äù  Conclusion Although ChatGPT rap lyrics appear entertaining, the tool does not miss the opportunity to educate about Bitcoin. From the lyrics, it‚Äôs clear that the AI tool understands the potential benefits to risks associated with Bitcoin.¬† These attributes also play out when the tool is tasked with describing Bitcoin in other forms. For example, ChatGPT remained educational and comical when we asked to explain Bitcoin like a 1920s monster.  ",2023-02-11

Are 10-year CD rates worth it?¬†                                Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.       When choosing a CD term, you'll want to consider the timeline of your goal. That said, not many financial institutions offer 10-year CDs, and the rates for short-term CDs are actually better than long-term CDs right now. You could build a CD ladder if you want to diversify your CDs and open multiple terms for more flexibility.                                     What is a CD?                                Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.       A CD is a time-sensitive savings account that holds your money at a fixed interest rate for a specified period of time. You can open one at almost any bank or credit union.                                     Are CDs safe?                                Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.       CDs are safer than investing your money in the stock market. Money in a CD is federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA for up $250,000 for up to $250,000. CDs are a good place to store and grow money that you will need at a predetermined future date. While your money doesn't have the potential to earn as much as it would in the stock market, there is no risk. CDs may be less liquid than a savings account, though.                                     Are CDs a good investment?                                Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.       Timing matters. CDs can be a good investment if interest rates are currently high and/or expected to fall. The biggest benefit of a CD is your ability to lock in a fixed interest rate. If interest rates fall during the term of your CD, the APY on your CD will not be affected. Conversely, if rates are expected to rise, then it may not be a good time to put money in a CD.                                     Can you lose money in CDs?                                Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.       You cannot lose money in a CD if you leave it untouched for the full term length. It is like a locked savings account and the only way you can lose money is if you make an early withdrawal for which you are penalized.                                     Are CD rates going up?                                Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.       Yes, CD rates have been going up. Interest rates on CDs follow the federal funds rate, which is determined by the Federal Reserve. Thus far, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates several times in 2023.

However, its CD rates are just short of the rates on our list.¬†Delta Community Credit Union: Delta Community Credit Union has a high rate on a 2-year term, but our top picks pay even higher rates right now.¬†America First Credit Union: America First Credit Union pays great interest rates on short-term CDs, but its just top rates are just a bit lower than our top picks.¬†CIT Bank: CIT Bank has a great interest rate on a 6-month term, but it's just short of the top rates we've included.Alliant Credit Union: Alliant Credit Union has high interest rates, but our top picks offer even more competitive rates.Bask Bank: Bask Bank has great interest rates for short-term CDs, but there are banks with even higher rates right now.¬†American Express National Bank (Member FDIC): American Express lets you open a CD with $0, but its rates aren't as high as those from other national brands included in our list.¬†Vio Bank: Vio Bank has good CD rates for terms between 6 months and 120 months, but our top picks have even more competitive rates right now.Consumers Credit Union: Consumers pays some solid rates, and it's a good choice if you're looking for a 10-month term.Salem Five Direct High-Yield: Salem Five Direct has competitive interest rates on short-term CDs, but they aren't quite as high as what you'll earn with our top picks.Chase: Chase offers solid interest rates on a 3-month and 12-month term if you qualify for relationship rates by having a Chase checking account.

But unlike most CDs, NBKC CDs pay variable rates, so rates can go up or down after you've opened the account.Bethpage Federal Credit Union: Bethpage CDs have a low minimum opening deposit but our top picks offer more competitive interest rates.Charles Schwab Bank: Charles Schwab has brokered CDs, meaning Charles Schwab doesn't actually own the CD. Instead, Charles Schwab acts as the middleman for you and the bank that owns the CD.

You can read their insights at the bottom of this post.                                                           Insider                                                        Here's what they had to say about CDs. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)What makes a CD good or not good?Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,¬†BoujieBudgets.com:""You always want to look at how much money you need to start up. And then if you can continuously add money in. Also, check not just what the interest rate is, but how often they pay out interest, whether it's monthly or quarterly.""How should someone choose a CD term length?Roger Ma, certified financial planner with¬†lifelaidout¬Æ¬†and author of¬†""Work Your Money, Not Your Life"":""I would think about when you need the money and then compare that with what the prevailing CD rates are, and then what makes sense from a financial perspective, but also from your own personal timing perspective.""Mykail James, CFEI: ""I believe in having a plan for whatever the funds are. If it's supposed to be a house fund, and you want to wait for another two years to buy a house, that's what you should be thinking of when you want to have this money.""How should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?Tania Brown, certified financial planner at¬†SaverLife:""So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.""Sophia Acevedo, certified educator in personal finance, banking reporter,¬†Personal Finance Insider:""Generally, I think a high-yield savings account or money market account could be good options for an emergency fund or short-term savings goals. A high-yield savings account offers a higher interest rate than traditional savings accounts at brick-and-mortar banks. Meanwhile, money market accounts might be worth considering if you want more account accessibility ‚Äî several offer paper checks, ATM cards, or debit cards. CDs could be worthwhile if you don't need access to some of your money, since they have a fixed interest rate for a specific term.""Methodology: How We Selected the Best CDs¬†Personal Finance Insider's mission is to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We understand that ""best"" is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account ‚Äî a high Annual Percentage Yield (APY), for example ‚Äî we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don't have to.We reviewed CD offerings from around a dozen national banks using our CD methodology. All banks included on our list are FDIC-insured and do not impose monthly maintenance fees on CDs.In the event two banks offered the same APY on a CD product, we considered minimum deposit requirements and penalties for early withdrawals.                                  window.addEventListener('message', onGoBankingResize, false); function                               onGoBankingResize(e) { { if (e.origin ===                               'https://products.gobankingrates.com' && e.data) { if (e.data.source &&                               e.data.id && undefined !== e.data.height) { var id = 'iframe[data-ident=""' +                               e.data.id + '""]'; var chosenFrame = document.querySelector(id); if                               (chosenFrame) { var height = e.data.height + 'px'; chosenFrame.style.height =                               height; } } } } }                                       Sophia Acevedo, CEPF  Banking Reporter     Sophia Acevedo is a banking reporter at Insider.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.Corporate earnings season is coming down the other side of the mountain after a hectic couple weeks.But even in the absence of a Fed meeting, or jobs report, or earrings reports from the market‚Äôs biggest companies, the past week offered plenty to investors on the biggest themes in markets and the corporate world that have featured so far in 2023.Fed bump fadesThis past week, the stock market saw the major indexes cap off their worst week of 2023.All three major indexes rallied to start 2023, with the Nasdaq enjoying its best January since 2001 after gaining more than 11% in the year‚Äôs first month.The early-year rally was punctuated on Wednesday, Feb. 1, when the Nasdaq gained some 2% after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said ‚Äúdisinflation‚Äù had become a feature of the U.S. economy in a press conference. In an interview with financier David Rubenstein this week, Powell reiterated his view that disinflationary pressures are reaching the U.S. economy ‚Äì primarily in the goods sector.The second time around, Powell‚Äôs words didn‚Äôt excite investors much.And as economic data shows the economy gained momentum in January, hopes for an imminent Fed pivot appear to be fading among some investors.Outside of any Fed-related influence on the market‚Äôs day-to-day action, the volatility we continue to see is not suggestive of a healthy market. Even with a rally to start the year that washed some of the stink of 2022‚Äôs losses for some investors.As strategists at Bespoke Investment Group wrote Friday in a note to clients, ‚ÄúVolatility is usually a characteristic of a weak stock market rather than a strong one.‚Äù And this year‚Äôs market has been notably volatile.Story continuesThrough the first 27 trading days of 2023 ‚Äì or the year‚Äôs trading through Thursday ‚Äì the Nasdaq has moved 1% in either direction 15 times, according to Bespoke‚Äôs data. In the prior nine instances this volatility was seen, the market was down six times and the largest rally had been 7.2%, which pales in comparison to the ~12% gain seen in the index this year.Perhaps more troubling for the bulls right now are the other three years the Nasdaq saw this level of volatility through the first six weeks of the year ‚Äì 1999, 2000, and 2001. The heart of the tech bubble bursting.U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell responds to a question from David Rubenstein (not pictured) during an on-stage discussion at a meeting of The Economic Club of Washington, at the Renaissance Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S, February 7, 2023. REUTERS/Amanda Andrade-RhoadesCuts continueIn the Corporate World, the dominant theme of the last few months has been the raft of companies announcing job cuts. This week was no exception.Cuts at Disney (DIS) were the headliner, with the company announcing Wednesday it would trim 7,000 jobs as newly returned CEO Bob Iger looks to cut $5.5 billion out of the business.In addition to these cuts, Iger also announced another restructuring of the company‚Äôs business lines, telling investors on the company‚Äôs earnings call these moves ""will result in a more cost-effective coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations, and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment.""Alongside these cost cuts, Iger also said he would reinstate Disney‚Äôs dividend. His reward for this latest act of corporate wizardry? The end of a proxy fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz.And while job cuts have spread from the tech sector out into the worlds of media, conglomerates, and beyond, the tech sector remains the center of pressure for the white collar workforce right now.Zoom (ZM), one of the stock market‚Äôs first and biggest pandemic-related winners, announced this week it would cut 15% of its workforce, or around 1,300 workers. CEO Eric Yuan will also take a 98% reduction in base pay for this year while the balance of the company‚Äôs executive staff will see a 20% pay cut.Yuan said the company‚Äôs trajectory was ‚Äúforever changed‚Äù during the pandemic, but said Zoom ‚Äúalso made mistakes‚Äù as it staffed up to meet these challenges.‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities,‚Äù Yuan wrote in an email to employees. ‚Äú[The] uncertainty of the global economy, and its effect on our customers, means we need to take a hard‚Äîyet important‚Äîlook inward to reset ourselves so we can weather the economic environment, deliver for our customers and achieve Zoom‚Äôs long-term vision.‚ÄùDell (DELL), eBay (EBAY), and JPMorgan (JPM) were also among the major public companies that saw some level of staff reductions over the last week.SHANGHAI, CHINA - FEBRUARY 27, 2022 - (FILE) Customers shop at the first Disney flagship store in China in Shanghai, China, February 27, 2022. February 9, 2023 - Disney CEO Bob Iger says the company will cut 7,000 jobs to cut $5.5 billion in costs. That's about 3 percent of the global workforce. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Crypto pressures riseAs markets rallied to start the year, crypto was front and center with bitcoin enjoying its best January performance since 2013, gaining nearly 40% in the year‚Äôs first month.But the early part of February has served as another reminder for the industry that crypto winter is here, even if the price for some blue chip crypto assets has firmed of late.BNPL giant Affirm ‚Äì which also announced a 19% cut to its staff ‚Äì said this week it would shutter its Affirm Crypto initiative. Like most companies cutting back, Affirm said in a shareholder letter due to economic uncertainty, ‚Äúwe are doubling down on our core businesses.‚ÄùEvidently buying stuff now and paying for it later with crypto was not core to the business.Elsewhere in corporate crypto maneuvers, Robinhood said it would take a $12 million charge and had backed out of a deal to buy crypto company Ziglu, a deal initially announced back in April 2022.On the regulatory side, a busy year remained that way with the SEC announcing on Thursday a settlement with exchange Kraken over its staking business. As part of the settlement, Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine and shut down its crypto staking offering for U.S. users.Ahead of Thursday‚Äôs announcement, shares of Coinbase (COIN) fell 13% after CEO Brian Armstrong cryptically tweeted about talk of the SEC trying to shut down all staking for U.S. retail investors. The stock fell another 4% on Friday.Whether Armstrong‚Äôs fears turn out to be founded or not, Thursday‚Äôs action from the SEC against Kraken was the agency‚Äôs fourth this year against crypto firms as the regulator continues to tighten its control of the industry.As SEC Chair Gensler told Yahoo Finance in December: ""We are enforcing [existing securities laws]. We have publicly been saying to these crypto intermediaries‚Ä¶to come into compliance with the law.‚ÄùGensler told Yahoo Finance he had one goal when it came to regulating crypto in 2023: make crypto exchanges and lending platforms come into compliance.""They can do that appropriately, working with the SEC, or we can continue on a course with more enforcement actions, and I would have to say that the runway's getting shorter,"" he said.‚ÄîClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube",2023-02-11

According to a¬†report, the Chinese central bank launched about 200 activities for e-CNY across the country during the holiday period. These activities aimed to promote consumption. During this exercise, many cities in Chain rolled out 180 million yuan ($26.5) worth of CBDC in subsidies and consumption coupon programs. Global Times, a Chinese English-based news outlet, cited cities like Shenzhen‚Äôs local government gave out more than $14.7 million worth of e-CNY to subsidize the catering industry. China has made several efforts, including setting targets for different cities to boost its CBDC usage. Another¬†report noted that Hangzhou city issued 80 yuan worth of e-CNY vouchers to each resident on January 16. The city gave away a total of 4 million yuan ($590,000) worth of e-CNY.

Earlier in January, the app also received an update to allow users to carry out wireless payments using Android phones. China has been a world-renowned technology hub over the years.

Will this continue, or are they about to bounce? Bitcoin bounce? Bitcoin fell from $24,300 down to $21,500 in around 9 days, which equates to an 11.5% fall in value. Many are calling for the cryptocurrency king to fall a lot further and even for it to come down and find new lows. When everyone starts planning for such a scenario we all know how that ends. The market will probably do the opposite. As it stands, bitcoin has fallen to the midpoint of the range between $25,225 and $17,600. It‚Äôs still too early to call, but a little bounce has already happened. A golden cross has just taken place on the daily for bitcoin and even though this is a lagging indicator, it is likely to be seen by the market as a promising sign. Looking at the short term, things also look quite good. The Stochastic RSI is an indicator that signals momentum, and this is at the bottom for practically all the short term time frames from 2-day, down to 4-hourly. A cross up has the potential to force price higher. Altcoins also A similar scenario can be seen with altcoins. Even though the total market cap of altcoins was forced back into the downward sloping channel, price has seen a bounce off of the 200-day moving average. It might be expected that the Total 3 at least moves back to retest the top of the channel, and with the daily Stochastic short term indicators also at the bottom, upwards movement could be forthcoming. Latest narrative Following on from the frenzied AI narrative that lasted quite some time, zero knowledge projects are the latest to run. Mina Protocol is one of the highest market caps in this category, and is riding high recently.¬† After a drop Mina has rebounded strongly and has recorded a 39% rise in only the last two days. Mina has arrived at the $1 resistance and a break through this could see it reach as high as the next resistance at $1.61. Dusk Network is another of the zk high-flyers. The privacy project put on 84% for a price of 26 cents on Friday alone. It did pull back to close the day on 18 cents, but has continued its rise today and has reached over 21 cents at time of going to press. 28 cents beckons.

The attackers ""use several highly obfuscated and under-development custom loaders in order to infect those involved in the cryptocurrency industry with Enigma stealer,"" Trend Micro researchers Aliakbar Zahravi and Peter Girnus said in a report this week. Enigma is said to be an altered version of Stealerium, an open source C#-based malware that acts as a stealer, clipper, and keylogger. The intricate infection journey starts with a rogue RAR archive file that's distributed via phishing or social media platforms. It contains two documents, one of which is a .TXT file that includes a set of sample interview questions related to cryptocurrency. The second file is a Microsoft Word document that, while serving as a decoy, is tasked with launching the first-stage Enigma loader, which, in turn, downloads and executes an obfuscated secondary-stage payload through Telegram. ""To download the next stage payload, the malware first sends a request to the attacker-controlled Telegram channel [...] to obtain the file path,"" the researchers said. ""This approach allows the attacker to continuously update and eliminates reliance on fixed file names."" The second-stage downloader, which is executed with elevated privileges, is designed to disable Microsoft Defender and install a third-stage by deploying a legitimately signed kernel mode Intel driver that's vulnerable to CVE-2015-2291 in a technique called Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).  It's worth noting that the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild. The third-stage payload ultimately paves the way for downloading Enigma Stealer from an actor-controlled Telegram channel. The malware, like other stealers, comes with features to harvest sensitive information, record keystrokes, and capture screenshots, all of which is exfiltrated back by means of Telegram.  Bogus job offers are a tried-and-tested tactic employed by North Korea-backed Lazarus Group in its attacks targeting the crypto sector. The adoption of this modus operandi by Russian threat actors ""demonstrates a persistent and lucrative attack vector."" The findings come as Uptycs released details of an attack campaign that leverages the Stealerium malware to siphon personal data, including credentials for cryptocurrency wallets such as Armory, Atomic Wallet, Coinomi, Electrum, Exodus, Guarda, Jaxx Liberty, and Zcash, among others.  Joining Enigma Stealer and Stealerium in targeting cryptocurrency wallets is yet another malware dubbed Vector Stealer that also comes with capabilities to steal .RDP files, enabling the threat actors to carry out RDP hijacking for remote access, Cyble said in a technical write-up. Attack chains documented by the cybersecurity firms show that the malware families are delivered through Microsoft Office attachments containing malicious macros, suggesting that miscreants are still relying on the method despite Microsoft's attempts to close the loophole. A similar method has also been put to use to deploy a Monero crypto miner against the backdrop of a cryptojacking and phishing campaign aimed at Spanish users, according to Fortinet FortiGuard Labs.  The development is also the latest in a long list of attacks that are aimed at stealing victims' cryptocurrency assets across platforms. This comprises a ""rapidly evolving"" Android banking trojan referred to as TgToxic, which plunders credentials and funds from crypto wallets as well as bank and finance apps. The ongoing malware campaign, active since July 2022, is directed against mobile users in Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia. ""When the victim downloads the fake app from the website given by the threat actor, or if victim tries to send a direct message to the threat actor through messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Viber, the cybercriminal deceives the user into registering, installing the malware, and enabling the permissions it needs,"" Trend Micro said. The rogue apps, besides abusing Android's accessibility services to carry out the unauthorized fund transfers, is also notable for taking advantage of legitimate automation frameworks like Easyclick and Auto.js to perform clicks and gestures, making it the second Android malware after PixPirate to incorporate such workflow IDEs.  But social engineering campaigns have also gone beyond social media phishing and smishing by setting up convincing landing pages that imitate popular crypto services with the goal of transferring Ethereum and NFTs from the hacked wallets. This, according to Recorded Future, is achieved by injecting a crypto drainer script into the phishing page which lures victims into connecting their wallets with lucrative offers to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Such ready-made phishing pages are being sold on darknet forums as part of what's called a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) scheme, permitting other actors to rent out these packages and swiftly enact malicious operations at scale. ""'Crypto drainers' are malicious scripts that function like e-skimmers and are deployed with phishing techniques to steal victims' crypto assets,"" the company said in a report published last week, describing the scams as effective and growing in popularity. ""The use of legitimate services on crypto drainer phishing pages may increase the likelihood that the phishing page will pass an otherwise savvy user's 'scam litmus test.' Once crypto wallets have been compromised, no safeguards exist to prevent the illicit transfer of assets to attackers' wallets."" The assaults come at a time when criminal groups have stolen a record-breaking $3.8 billion from crypto businesses in 2022, with much of the spike attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hacking crews.

However, the yearly advertising spectacu‚Ä¶ [+4154 chars]",Business Today,"Following their appearance in last year's Super Bowl broadcast, cryptocurrency companies are anticipated to sit out the 2023 event, reported news agency AFP.  However, the yearly advertising spectacular ‚Äî a kind of marketing battle that runs parallel to the American football championship ‚Äî features a variety of beer and car firms, as well as other well-known brands such as M&M's chocolates, which has been teasing its spot since last month.  The ""Breaking Bad"" ensemble reunites to promote PopCorners chips in this year's commercial lineup, which also includes a collaboration between General Motors and Netflix that features an electric car navigating ""Squid Games"" and other settings from popular streaming shows.  The advertisements are highly profitable, frequently earning $6 or $7 million for 30 seconds of airtime. That is nearly ten times the price of an advertisement during the United States vs. Britain World Cup game in 2022.  According to Kantar, a data analytics and brand consultant, last year's game produced $578 million in advertising revenue for NBC, an increase of $143.8 million over the previous year's telecast.  Fox Sports will broadcast the event this year.  ""It's a lot of money for a media spot,"" said Derek Rucker, a Northwestern University marketing professor. ""However, where else can you get 100 million people to see an advertisement at the same time?""  The advertisements have become such an important part of the game in the United States that ""a vast amount of people"" actively watch and discuss the commercials during gatherings, according to Rucker.  Every year in the middle of winter, ""Super Bowl Sunday"" brings together families and friends for several hours of competition, revelry, and entertainment.  The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles in this year's game. As is customary, the show features A-list half-time entertainment, this time led by Rihanna. Over-the-top advertisements have a lengthy history, including such landmarks as Ridley Scott's minute-long commercial for Apple launching the Macintosh computer in 1984.  The commercial, which portrays a female athlete breaking a screen depicting a ""Big Brother"" figure, parodies George Orwell's famous novel, finishing with a vow that the introduction of the computer will demonstrate ""why 1984 won't be like '1984.'""  This years most anticipated commercial may be for M&M's, which only recently entered the US cultural battlefield.  M&M's, which is owned by Mars, announced on January 24 that it was suspending a publicity campaign featuring cartoon mascots of the coloured candies after the campaign was criticised as ""woke"" by US conservatives due to stylistic changes, such as the introduction of a purple character, a colour associated with the LGBTQ community.  M&M's declared an ""indefinite stop"" of the ""spokescandies"" and introduced a new brand ambassador, popular comedian Maya Rudolph, in a move ideally timed to capture public attention ahead of a splashy Super Bowl ad.  Gartner analyst Andrew Frank does not anticipate politically charged advertisements this year, expecting that corporations will tread carefully in a divided country where strong messages can backfire.  ""The antidote to backlash is humour, keeping it light,"" Frank said. ""I think they would like to deescalate all of the toxicity around culture wars and things like that.""  Last year's tournament featured numerous significant participants from the developing cryptocurrency sector, led by then-titan FTX and its founder Samuel Bankman-Fried. Since then, FTX has gone bankrupt, and Bankman-Fried has been charged with fraud.  The collapse of FTX and Bankman-Fried has produced ""a suitable opportunity for them to pause,"" according to Frank.  To compensate for the loss of advertising, Fox can now expect money from a broader range of beer firms, following the termination of a long-standing exclusivity agreement with Anheuser-Busch, the owner of the Budweiser brand.  Frank anticipates that most spots would target ""leisure spending with lighter messaging of escapist enjoyment,"" as he put it.  The goal is to ""create the impression that everything is well and that you don't need to be so frugal with your discretionary spending.""

At its core, it is a decentralized blockchain that accommodates¬†smart contract¬†functionality.¬†Today, it's the¬†blockchain of choice for most developers and enterprises because its infrastructure has attracted global attention. It enables the programmability of smart contracts and ultimately serves as a backbone for a host of¬†decentralized apps (dApps), especially in the¬†decentralized finance (DeFi) space.¬†The popularity of Ethereum is clearly depicted through the following:Over¬†4,000 projects have been built on Ethereum.Ethereum has more than¬†96 million accounts (wallets) with an ETH balance.There are over 53.3 million smart contracts on Ethereum.Ethereum secures a value of¬†$410 billion.Creators earned¬†$3.5 billion on Ethereum in 2021.¬†What's Ether (ETH)?ETH essentially lets you be your bank. Herein, you can control the funds in your wallet without the intervention of any third party.¬†¬†¬†Apart from being globally digitized, ETH is the native token of the Ethereum Blockchain, which makes it the currency for all Ethereum apps. Thus, ETH is used to¬†pay gas (transaction) fees to use the Ethereum network.¬†ETH is also used for¬†staking. When you stake your ETH, you'll be able to help secure Ethereum and earn rewards in return.¬†What's more? You can use ETH as¬†collateral to yield different crypto tokens on Ethereum. Also, you can borrow, lend, and earn interest on ETH and other ETH-backed tokens.¬†Moreover, it offers significant flexibility due to its¬†divisibility up to 18 decimal places. This means you're not limited to purchasing a full ETH; you can acquire even minuscule fractions, as little as¬†0.000000000000000001 ETH.¬†One should consider that with increasing programmability, ETH could see multiple use cases in the coming times.¬†Ethereum doesn't impose a cap on the total amount of Ether that can be created. Instead, ether's supply is set to grow by¬†0.52% annually.¬† Additionally, during a transaction, the base fee is burned, thereby removing it from circulation. As of October 2023,¬†120,240,108 ETH are in circulation.¬†How does Ethereum work?Source: Ethereum.org¬†Consensus mechanismEthereum uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where validators create blocks based on the tokens they stake as collateral. This is different from the¬†Proof-of-Work (PoW)¬†model, which uses mining for validation.¬†¬†To participate, individuals lock up a minimum of¬†32 ETH to validate transactions, protect the network, and earn rewards.¬†Staking options on Ethereum include:Solo home staking: Users with a minimum of¬†32 ETH can stake directly, enjoying full rewards and control over their funds. This promotes network decentralization but demands technical knowledge and a stable internet connection.Staking as a service: With the same 32 ETH minimum, users can rely on¬†third-party¬†services for validator operations. This approach simplifies the process but requires trust, as staking keys are given to the service provider.Pooled staking: Designed for those with less than 32 ETH or seeking a hassle-free method, users can pool resources. This typically involves ""liquid staking"" via¬†ERC-20 tokens representing the staked ETH, offering flexibility.¬†Centralized exchanges:¬†The easiest way to stake ETH is through exchanges, but this centralization can introduce vulnerabilities to the Ethereum network due to the consolidation of large ETH pools.Given below are the core components of the Ethereum ecosystem.¬†Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)The EVM is a Turing-complete virtual machine that executes the¬†EVM Byte Code and serves as the runtime for all smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Every Ethereum node runs an EVM to maintain network consensus.¬†¬†Although separate from the primary Ethereum network to prevent smart contract manipulation, every EVM operation requires ""gas."" Users compensate for this gas using Ether, which deters spam and promotes code efficiency.¬†Ethereum tokensEthereum provides a platform for creating dApps and custom tokens. Most of these tokens follow standard patterns, the most common being¬†ERC-20¬†and¬†ERC-721.ERC-20 tokens:¬†Represent¬†fungible assets, meaning each token is the same as every other token. They're used for a variety of applications, from simple transfer of value to more complex dApps.ERC-721 tokens: Represent¬†non-fungible assets, meaning each token is unique. This uniqueness is often used for digital collectibles, artwork, and other unique digital assets.¬†Programming languagesSmart contracts on Ethereum are most commonly written in a high-level programming language called¬†Solidity. Once written, the Solidity code is then compiled down to Ethereum bytecode, which can be run on the EVM.¬†While Solidity is the most popular and widely used, there are other languages like¬†Vyper (which is more Pythonic) that can also be used to write smart contracts for Ethereum. These are less commonly used compared to Solidity but offer some different features and design philosophies.¬†GovernanceEthereum governance is a broad topic. The protocol doesn‚Äôt have a built-in governance¬†mechanism, so changes are proposed through¬†Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).¬†¬†EIPs are suggested enhancements to the Ethereum platform. They detail standards for protocols, contract interfaces, and best practices, guiding the Ethereum community's development and evolution. EIPs ensure consistent and collaborative progression of the network.¬†Ethereum governance involves numerous stakeholders. The various stakeholders, starting from those furthest from the protocol to the closest, are:Ether holdersApplication usersApplication/tooling developersNode operatorsEIP authorsValidatorsProtocol developers¬†¬†Ethereum‚Äôs evolutionSource: Ethereum.org¬†Ethereum was¬†proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer from Canada.

The biggest resistance for Bitco‚Ä¶ [+20746 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Bitcoin (BTC): An overviewSource: Bitcoin.org¬†The rationale behind¬†Bitcoin (BTC) sprung from the need for an electronic payment system based on¬†cryptographic proof instead of trust. This transition would allow any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.¬†Unlike traditional currencies,¬†BTC is neither issued by a central bank nor backed by any government. Thus making the king coin independent and away from plausible manipulations from the authorities.¬†In essence, it's a virtual currency developed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity.¬†¬†¬†How does Bitcoin work?Source: Bitcoin.org¬†At its core, Bitcoin uses a decentralized ledger called a¬†blockchain to record all transactions. Let's break down how it works:¬†BlockchainA¬†blockchain is basically a chain of blocks, where each block contains or holds a list of transactions. Once a block is added to the blockchain, it's nearly impossible to change. This ensures that once a transaction is confirmed, it can't easily be reversed or¬†altered.¬†Bitcoin uses the¬†SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a¬†256-bit hexadecimal number. That number contains all of the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.¬†Consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Work)For transactions to be added to the blockchain, they need to be confirmed by the network. This is done by miners through a process called mining.¬†PoW requires participants, called¬†miners, to solve intricate mathematical challenges to confirm and log transactions on the blockchain. These problems require significant computational power to solve but are easy for others to verify.¬†When a miner successfully solves the problem, they present the solution to the rest of the network. If accepted, a new block is added to the blockchain.¬†¬†PoW ensures security and prevents¬†double-spending by making it computationally costly to attack the network. Over time, the difficulty of these problems adjusts, ensuring consistent block generation times.¬†Supply and block rewardsTo incentivize mining, miners receive a reward in the form of newly generated (""minted"") bitcoins whenever they successfully append a block to the blockchain. This compensation is known as the¬†block reward. When Bitcoin was introduced in the year 2009, the reward was set at¬†50 BTC.¬†However, Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of¬†21 million coins. To ensure that these coins aren't all minted too quickly, the block reward is periodically reduced. As of September 2023,¬†19.49 million Bitcoins are in circulation.¬†Halving cycleThe mechanism that reduces the block reward is called ""halving."" Every¬†210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, the block reward is cut in half.1st halving (2012): 50 BTC -> 25 BTC2nd halving (2016): 25 BTC -> 12.5 BTC3rd halving (2020): 12.5 BTC -> 6.25 BTC... and so on, until the block reward approaches zero. The next halving is expected to happen between March and May 2024, around block 840,000.¬†Once all 21 million bitcoins have been mined (expected around the year¬†2140), miners will no longer receive block rewards and will only earn from¬†transaction fees.¬†The halving events are significant because they reduce the rate at which new BTCs are introduced into the economy. This built-in scarcity mechanism is one of the reasons why many people consider Bitcoin to be a store of value, similar to¬†gold.¬†DivisibilityBitcoin's divisibility is one of its key features, enabling its use in microtransactions and ensuring its usability even if its value rises dramatically. A single Bitcoin can be subdivided into 100,000,000 smaller units, referred to as ""satoshis,"" named after its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.¬†Here's a breakdown of Bitcoin's divisibility:1 Bitcoin (BTC) = 100,000,000 satoshis1 mBTC (milliBitcoin) = 100,000 satoshis = 0.001 BTC1 ŒºBTC (microBitcoin or ""bit"") = 100 satoshis = 0.000001 BTC1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC¬†Bitcoin's journeySource: Bitcoin.org¬†Bitcoin's journey is a fascinating tale of technological innovation, financial disruption, and societal evolution. Since its inception, it has experienced meteoric rises, notable declines, regulatory challenges, and significant technological developments.¬†¬†It has become the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. Even so, the coin's characteristics had set the foundation for the development of many other cryptos. Today, BTC's benefits are well-regarded in some countries, so much so that they've declared it as the official currency.¬†Here's a brief overview of Bitcoin's journey:¬†2008: The story begins with the release of a¬†whitepaper named ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" by an entity or individuals going by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. This paper introduced the concept of a decentralized digital currency that doesn't require a central authority or intermediaries.¬†2009:¬†On January 3, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the inaugural block of the Bitcoin blockchain, termed the ""genesis block."" By January 12, the first-ever Bitcoin transaction occurred when Satoshi transferred¬†10 BTC to Hal Finney.¬†2010: The first recorded purchase using Bitcoin was made by Laszlo Hanyecz, who bought two pizzas for¬†10,000 BTC. This event is commemorated annually as ""Bitcoin Pizza Day."" Later this year, Bitcoin exchanges started to emerge.¬†2011: As Bitcoin's popularity grew, the first alternative cryptocurrencies (often termed ""altcoins"") began to emerge, with Litecoin (LTC) being one of the most notable.¬†2013: Bitcoin surpassed the¬†$1,000 mark for the¬†first time. However, this was also a period of volatility, partly because of regulatory concerns and high-profile incidents like the Mt. Gox exchange hack.¬†2014: Formerly the world's leading Bitcoin exchange,¬†Mt. Gox, declared¬†bankruptcy following multiple security breaches and purported misappropriation of funds. This event caused a significant drop in Bitcoin's price.¬†2017: Bitcoin began the year under¬†$1,000 and finished around¬†$20,000, drawing significant mainstream attention. This year also saw the rise of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a fundraising mechanism. By the end of the year, the CME Group and the CBOE started offering Bitcoin futures.¬†2018: After the exhilarating highs of 2017, Bitcoin faced a stark downturn, ushering in the ""crypto winter"" of 2018-2019. During this phase, BTC's value dipped by approximately¬†84%.¬†¬†This decline, shaped by regulatory challenges and shifts in market sentiment, wiped out substantial gains. It sowed widespread skepticism, testing the previously buoyant optimism about the future of cryptocurrencies.¬†2020:¬†Companies like¬†MicroStrategy began investing significant portions of their treasuries in Bitcoin. The currency again began to garner attention and regained its 2017 highs by December.¬†2021: Bitcoin reached new all-time highs in 2021, crossing¬†$60,000. However, with increased attention came increased regulatory scrutiny.2022:¬†In 2022, the cryptocurrency market faced another pronounced¬†bear market, marked by steep declines in Bitcoin's value from its record highs. This downturn was precipitated by growing environmental apprehensions about Bitcoin's energy use, notably amplified by influencers like¬†Elon Musk.¬†",2023-02-11

A bizarre artefact of the current cultural moment, these machines have flooded U.S. cities over the past several years, but boom times for the little bitcoin dispensers may soon be at an end. One of their biggest U.S. operators is broke. Cash Cloud ‚Äî which supplies some 7.9 per cent of the bitcoin ATM machines in  the U.S. ‚Äî filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Nevada bankruptcy court on Tuesday, Cointelegraph reports. The company‚Äôs bankruptcy comes mere weeks after Cash Cloud‚Äôs biggest financial supporter, the crypto lender Genesis Global, also filed for bankruptcy, yet another victim of cryptocurrency‚Äôs massive downturn over the past nine months. The Las Vegas-based ATM vendor, which sells its line of Coin Cloud crypto machines in both the U.S. and Brazil, has only $US50 ($69) million to $US100 ($139) million in assets but has  liabilities between $US100 ($139) million to $US500 ($694) million, according to its bankruptcy filing. The filing also says that the company has between 5,001 and 10,000 creditors. I‚Äôm no Goldman Sachs intern, but I‚Äôd say that seems bad.  Gizmodo reached out to Coin Cloud for comment  and will update this story if it responds. In a statement provided to Cointelegraph, Chris McAlary, the founder and CEO of Coin Cloud, said that the bankruptcy would allow the company to ‚Äúrework our debt, protect the interests of our creditors, and emerge as a stronger, more financially stable company.‚Äù McAlary added that he was still ‚Äúoptimistic about the future of the cryptocurrency industry.‚Äù  Over the past several years, crypto ATMs crept into America‚Äôs less glamorous places, popping up in cities‚Äô truck stops, gas stations, and convenience stores, as crypto‚Äôs brief national glowup proceeded in earnest. That glowup is decidedly over. Axios writes that, between September 2020 and September 2022, the number of machines in the U.S. more than tripled, driving the total number up to at least 63,000 machines, according to one online estimate. Of that number, Coin Cloud played an important role, representing a 7.9% share of the nation‚Äôs bitcoin ATM market overall, Axios writes.

Ripple (XRP) is a cryptocurrency‚Ä¶ [+14681 chars]",Ambcrypto.com,"¬†Ripple (XRP): An overviewSource: Ripple.com¬†Ripple (XRP) is a digital payment protocol that operates on an open-source, peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized platform. It allows seamless transfers of any form of money, whether fiat or crypto. Ripple seeks to streamline¬†cross-border bank transfers, offering a faster alternative to traditional methods.¬†¬†Essentially, it aims to make global transactions as straightforward and cost-effective as sending an email.¬†XRP is the inherent digital currency of the Ripple system, operating on the¬†XRP Ledger (XRPL). Within the Ripple framework, it acts as a digital¬†representation for transferring value across the network.¬†Unlike many other digital currencies, XRP was pre-mined and has a cap of¬†100 billion. The distribution of its entire supply is as follows:80 billion¬†XRP was initially allocated to Ripple Labs, the overseeing company.20 billion¬†XRP was distributed among Ripple's co-founders and the primary team.As of September 2023,¬†53.2 billion XRP are circulating in the market.¬†Let‚Äôs take a look at its role in the Ripple ecosystem.¬†Bridge currency:¬†XRP can act as a bridge between two fiat currencies, ensuring that liquidity is always available without the need for parties to hold large reserves of any particular currency. This facilitates smooth and efficient cross-border transactions.¬†Anti-spam mechanism:¬†The small amount of XRP that's¬†burned¬†as the transaction cost acts as a deterrent against spamming the network. By attaching a minor cost to transactions, malicious actors are dissuaded from overloading the system.¬†Settlement: Transactions using XRP can settle in just a few seconds, making it much faster than many traditional banking systems or even other cryptocurrencies. This rapid settlement time is one of the features that makes XRP attractive to financial institutions.¬†How does Ripple work?Source: Ripple/Facebook¬†Here are the two main components of the Ripple ecosystem:¬†XRPLXRPL functions as an open-source, decentralized blockchain responsible for executing and validating transactions within the network. It uses the¬†XRPL consensus protocol:Consensus, not mining: Unlike¬†Bitcoin's (BTC) Proof of Work (PoW), XRPL achieves consensus without competitive computational work, allowing for faster and less energy-consuming transactions.Validators: These are nodes that validate and propose transactions for the ledger. They ensure the network's decentralization and that any entity can run a validator.Unique node list (UNL):¬†A list of trusted validators chosen by each server on the network. A transaction is validated when there's at least¬†80% agreement among the validators in a server's UNL.Consensus rounds: Validators propose versions of the next ledger. If a supermajority agrees on a transaction set, it's validated. This typically occurs in seconds.Fork prevention:¬†The consensus mechanism ensures the network doesn't split into multiple chains. Disagreements are resolved in subsequent consensus rounds.Safety and security: Prioritizing safety, the protocol can stall the network during disruptions but won't validate incorrect transactions.Listed below are the numbers:Transactions settle on the XRPL in¬†3-5 seconds.¬†XRP transaction fees average¬†$0.0002 per transaction.¬†XRPL technology can handle 3,400 transactions per second.¬†There have been¬†80 million closed ledgers since 2012.¬†XRPL is¬†61,000 times¬†more energy-efficient than PoW blockchains.¬†It has a global network of over¬†100 validators.¬†RippleNetRippleNet is essentially a network of institutional payment providers, such as banks and other financial organizations. These entities utilize RippleNet to offer a frictionless experience to send money globally.¬†¬†An essential component of RippleNet is¬†On-demand liquidity (ODL). Traditional cross-border transfers often require banks to have¬†""nostro"" accounts in the recipient country, pre-funded with the local currency. ODL negates this need.¬†¬†When a financial institution wants to make a cross-border transfer, they can use ODL to convert their currency to XRP and then immediately convert that XRP to the destination currency. This two-step conversion happens almost instantly, making the transfer process much faster.¬†The transaction processHere's a breakdown of how a transaction on the Ripple network is completed:¬†¬†Gateway setup and participation:¬†Within the Ripple network, gateways act as the intermediary link between two parties wanting to make a transaction. A gateway acts as a middleman for credit, facilitating the receipt and transmission of currencies to public addresses on the Ripple network.¬†When you deposit money into a gateway's account, you receive an IOU (I Owe You), which can be sent, received, traded, or redeemed.¬† The gateway will handle fiat deposits and withdrawals, ensuring the IOUs it issues are backed by real assets.¬†Establishing trustlines:¬†Before you can receive an IOU from a gateway, you have to set up a trustline. This indicates how much you are willing to trust the gateway with IOUs (essentially, IOU credit limits).¬†Trustlines are critical for ensuring the security of the Ripple system. They ensure that IOUs are only issued by parties that users have explicitly trusted.¬†Initiating a transaction:¬†A user who wishes to send a payment using Ripple will create a transaction specifying the amount, the recipient, and possibly the currency they wish the recipient to receive. Ripple's protocol will then begin pathfinding.¬†Pathfinding:¬†One of Ripple's unique features is its ability to find the most efficient path for a transaction. When making a transaction, the protocol searches for the shortest and quickest path between the sender and the receiver, even if it involves multiple currencies and intermediaries. This ensures that transactions are not only fast but also efficient in terms of costs.¬†Transaction settlement: Once the best path is found, the transaction is executed. If IOUs are involved, they will be transferred between parties accordingly. If conversion is required, it will be carried out through market-making activities within the Ripple network.¬†The evolution of RippleSource: Ripple/Facebook¬†Ripple‚Äôs history and evolution can be traced back to the early days of the cryptocurrency movement. Here's an overview:¬†Pre-Ripple era: Conception and early days (2004-2012)Before Ripple and XRP, there was a system called Ripplepay, introduced by Ryan Fugger in 2004.¬† Ripplepay was a forerunner to Ripple. It was designed as a decentralized platform, but the idea of a consistent cryptocurrency like XRP wasn't part of this early system. Fugger sold the business to Jed McCaleb.¬†The birth of Ripple (2012-2015)In 2012, McCaleb invited Chris Larsen to co-found¬†OpenCoin. They aimed to develop a new digital payment protocol based on a concept by Ryan Fugger.¬†Following this,¬†XRPL and XRP were introduced in 2012 as the digital currency for the Ripple payment protocol. In 2013, OpenCoin changed its name to¬†Ripple Labs, Inc. This was later changed to just¬†Ripple in 2015.¬†XRPL Foundation (2020)The¬†XRPL Foundation was founded in September as an independent, nonprofit entity. Its mission is to boost the development and widespread adoption of the decentralized XRPL.¬†¬†Major blockchain entities like Coil, Ripple, and Gatehub provided initial donations exceeding¬†$6.5 million to fund the foundation‚Äôs endeavors, showcasing their commitment to nurturing the XRPL‚Äôs ecosystem.¬†The SEC-Ripple sagaOn December 22, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The lawsuit stated that Ripple had raised¬†$1.3 billion¬†through the sale of XRPs being unregistered securities.¬†To sum it all up, the SEC argument implied that XRP should be considered a¬†security rather than a cryptocurrency and hence would come under their ambit to charge tax on the sale as a security.¬†After almost two years in court, Ripple secured a partial victory against the SEC. On July 13, 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple's sale of XRP on public exchanges did not breach federal securities regulations.¬†Judge Torres also determined that the¬†$728.9 million in XRP transactions conducted by the company with hedge funds and other institutional clients were unregistered securities sales, granting the SEC a partial win.¬†However, in early September, the SEC officially challenged the ruling, suggesting that the battle is not yet over.",2023-02-11

But regardless of these perspectives, the events of the past few days have served as a reminder of the increased inspection of the cryptocurrency industry. As the sector continues to grow and gain mainstream adoption, companies like Bitzlato will need to maintain a high level of transparency and compliance to build and maintain public trust. Other Arrests Around Bitzlato The Hong Kong-certified crypto exchange, Bitzlato, has been functioning since 2016. However, in January 2023, its operations ceased following the founder‚Äôs arrest, Anatoly Legkodymov. The Department of Justice, in collaboration with FinCEN, charged him with transmitting unlicensed funds. Simultaneously, four additional people connected to the Europe-based Bitzlato came under the custody of Europol. The law enforcement agency reported these individuals guilty of money laundering. According to Shkurenko, the four persons stole about 18 million Euros worth of digital assets from 35% of Bitzlato‚Äôs users. The European authorities also realized additional assets worth about 32 million Euros when it froze more than 100 accounts connected to the crypto exchange, Bitzlato. Bitcoin set to rise after plunging on the daily candle l BTCUSDT on Tradingview.com According to an interview with a Russian-based digital asset YouTube channel, Satoshkin, on January 31, Shkurenko revealed the identity of the four perpetrators. He said the individuals arrested were a marketing director, Alexander Goncharenko, CEO Mikhail Luven, dev-ops engineer Konstantin, and contractor Pavel Lerner. Out of these four individuals, only Konstantin, who currently lives in Cyprus, was released, while the rest remain in detention. Feature Image from Pixabay, Alexas_Fotos chart from TradingView.

For some, the FTX collapse w‚Ä¶ [+5813 chars]",CryptoSlate,"The Wild West of crypto has had no shortage of scandals in its short history, but the recent collapse of FTX ranks highly among the worst to have afflicted the industry.For some, the FTX collapse was a disaster from which they will not financially recover. Those who fall into this camp may find it difficult to accept it as an experience to learn from. Nonetheless, for the industry to move forward, we still have to consider the advantages gained from this unmitigated disaster.This calls for the pain to be absorbed with the resolve never to repeat what happened. From now on, we should all strive to carry out appropriate due diligence, avoid centralized platforms wherever possible, and sharpen our bullsh*t detectors. From this adversity, a more astute crypto investor will emerge.WTF FTXAs the scandal broke, social media was flooded with numerous reports on the inner workings of the business. This included details on the bizarre sexual, drug-fueled company culture and the inexperience of key personnel who were unqualified to handle the vast sums that flowed into the exchange.Even stranger was the post-resignation period when mainstream media (MSM) rallied behind SBF in a vain attempt to convince their readership that 2 + 2 = 5.Within a short period, SBF‚Äôs character arc had flipped from quirky billionaire philanthropist to the devil sporting an afro. That fall from grace had associates, including celebrities and crypto influencers, scrambling hard to put distance between themselves and the brand.However, what stings more is the reputational damage against an industry that was already viewed with deep suspicion by outsiders. The good work done to propel crypto forward as a viable and credible TradFi alternative has been set back temporarily.Blockchain and cryptocurrency were supposed to be the great equalizer, solving financial inequality and corruption. Yet, ironically, with SBF at the helm, this technology became the vehicle with which to carry out fraud and manipulation.Authorities swarmingMaking matters worse, authorities now have the excuse needed to justify heavy-handed policies and far-reaching regulations.Speculation that this was always the end goal is rampant. While this claim is unverified, it is difficult to dismiss the link entirely, considering SBF‚Äôs political pull and MSM support.For the sake of credible stewardship, the World Economic Forum said JPMorgan and other such ‚Äúresponsible actors‚Äù should be handed control of cryptocurrency. Similarly, Senator Elizabeth Warren recently called on regulators to get tough with the industry to protect consumers.On Feb. 9, the SEC said it had reached a settlement with Kraken over its staking program. The outcome would see the exchange end its staking service to U.S. customers and pay a $30 million fine.This action did not specifically target areas such as exchange tokens or financial reporting/auditing, which were ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù that enabled SBF to carry out his alleged crimes.Crypto Investor Adam Cochran pointed out the unusual¬† ‚Äúbuddy-buddy‚Äù relationship between the SEC and FTX is all the more suspicious following the Kraken action. Cochran asserts that the SEC, under Chair Gensler, has ulterior motives to crush the industry.‚ÄúGensler is not a regulator. He is an agent of an anti-crypto agenda, who only aims to wield his power as cudgel for those he doesn‚Äôt agree with. So the big question then, is why didn‚Äôt FTX get this treatment? Whose pocket is he in?‚ÄùSBF‚Äôs belated extradition to the U.S. to face charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering does give a degree of closure. However, it seems the SEC will continue milking the ‚Äúconsumer protection‚Äù line until their agenda is complete.Societal sicknessDiscussing the collapse on the Bankless Podcast recently, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees called people‚Äôs dependency on the system to protect them a ‚Äúsickness in society.‚Äù He said no one is happy with the slimy politicians or their actions, yet many continue hoping the political process will bring change for the better.‚ÄúFor many, many years, I‚Äôve lamented that people seek protection from the state in principle. I think this is a sickness in society. It‚Äôs like a new form of religion in which people see problems that are real, and they have this appeal to this thing called democracy or government.‚ÄùVoorhees said SBF is ‚Äúan advocate of that world‚Äù and often drew praise for engaging with the system. In contrast, Voorhees sees himself as a genuine capitalist who believes free markets solve problems better than coercive governments.‚ÄúMost people looking at this would have praised Sam, that he‚Äôs working within the system, that he‚Äôs the upstanding citizen here. And Erik is this radical extremist.‚ÄùThe biggest favor SBF did was to shine a light on the fallacy that governments and ‚Äúhigher authorities,‚Äù including the SEC, know what‚Äôs best for us. As Voorhees said, ‚Äúour salvation is in open source immutable code, period,‚Äù not in ‚Äúany blessing or anointment from D.C.‚ÄùRecent events demonstrate ‚Äúthe system‚Äù does not stand for freedom, democracy, and personal sovereignty. Instead, these words have become bastardized to the point they are meaningless when uttered by agents of the system.Ultimately, SBF demonstrated that only we know what is best for us ‚Äî not slimy politicians or ‚Äúeffective altruists.‚Äù It‚Äôs a shame that billions of dollars had to be stolen to figure this out.Posted In: Op-Ed  Author      Samuel Wan     Analyst at CryptoSlateSamuel Wan, a finance professional turned full-time crypto content creator, values individual autonomy and personal freedom in his pursuits.

In its latest Blockchain Letter on Feb. 8, the asset management fi‚Ä¶ [+3358 chars]",Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning its ‚Äúseventh bull cycle,‚Äù and investors should not be scared of crypto post-FTX, Pantera Capital believes.In its latest ‚ÄúBlockchain Letter‚Äù on Feb. 8, the asset management firm‚Äôs CEO, Dan Morehead, predicted that 2023 would be a ‚Äúyear for rebuilding trust.‚ÄùMorehead: Crypto assets have ‚Äúseen the lows‚Äù this cycleWith BTC price action retracing slightly after gaining 40% in January, some market participants still insist that new macro lows are due across crypto assets.While the timing for such a scenario varies, consensus remains absent when it comes to how the market will rebound.For Morehead, however, the time to flip bullish on crypto is already here.‚ÄúPantera has been through ten years of Bitcoin cycles and I‚Äôve traded through 35 years of similar cycles,‚Äù he noted.‚ÄúI believe that blockchain assets have seen the lows and that we‚Äôre in the next bull market cycle ‚Äì regardless of what happens in the interest-rate-sensitive asset classes.‚ÄùThat perspective differs from the majority in casting aside the debate over crypto price correlation with risk assets such as equities. As Cointelegraph continues to report, this forms the backbone of some other prognoses for 2023.Morehead argued that the drawdown from Bitcoin‚Äôs latest all-time highs had placed the market well within the historical context, despite dipping below its previous bull market all-time high after the FTX debacle in November 2022.‚ÄúThe decline from November 2021 to November 2022 was the median of the typical cycle. This is the only bear market to more than completely wipe out the previous bull market. In this case, giving back 136% of the previous rally,‚Äù he wrote, alongside accompanying data. ‚ÄúThe median downdraft has been 307 days and the previous bear market was 376. The median drawdown has been a -73% downdraft and the latest bear market ended at -77%.‚ÄùGoing forward, a trend change will ensue, with Bitcoin on its way to fresh record highs.‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre done with that and beginning to grind higher,‚Äù Morehead added.

In the span of a few months, the world saw Three Arrows Capital collapse, Do Kwon‚Äôs LUNA disintegrate, Voyager Digital go bankrupt, and Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs (SBF) FTX empire shatter,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWhat did all these events have in common? The headlines like to suggest that it was crypto or Web3 that failed. But, in fact, it was a combination of bad actors skirting lines in jurisdictions without clear regulations. If 2022 was the year of breaking rules and failing, I believe 2023 is the year that entities instead follow the rules and enjoy the rewards of doing so.‚ÄùWhile the letter did not mention the current regulatory battle involving the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, it foresaw CeFi reclaiming its clout worldwide ‚Äúon a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction level.‚ÄùThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors‚Äô alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.

Filan üá∫üá∏üáÆüá™ (@FilanLaw) February 10, 2023 As stated, the plaintiff opposes the XRP holders' request to file an amicus brief, while the defendant (Ripple) consents.       Ads        Ads     Deaton argues that the plaintiff's opposition demonstrates that the interests of over 75,000 XRP holders will not be pursued, or protected unless the court grants leave to file the proposed amicus brief. RelatedRipple Pro Lawyer John Deaton's Crypto Prediction Sparks Concern Deaton makes a compelling case that XRP holders have a unique viewpoint that differs significantly from the parties. He adds that the lead plaintiff purchased XRP between Jan. 1 and 16, 2018, and sold that XRP between Jan. 9 and 17, 2018. This implied that he only owned XRP for about two weeks more than five years ago. Deaton continued, ""The proposed amici and the other 75,890 XRP holders presently own XRP."" He further explains that, given the technological advancements related to¬†XRPL and the use cases for XRP, 2018's XRP is not the same as that of 2023. Also, many different XRP holders acquired XRP for many different reasons ‚Äî reasons unknown (or ignored) by the plaintiff. Deaton cited the fact that several XRP holders use XRP as a substitute for fiat and as a form of currency to buy everyday items at various locations. He gives a good reason why the court will benefit from XRP holders' participation ‚Äî to clear up some misconceptions by the plaintiff. ""Because Plaintiff only owned XRP for two weeks five years ago, he wrongly asserts that XRP is not decentralized like Bitcoin,"" Deaton stated. What happened In the Zakinov v. Ripple case, the plaintiffs allege that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security and are now requesting the court certify a class of all XRP holders who purchased the token, including those who hold XRP and those who sold at a loss. The proposed class would include XRP holders worldwide, including the 75,890 XRP holders who disagree with the plaintiffs in the Zakinov case and say XRP is not a security. ¬† John Deaton argues that the court should not certify the class because the majority of XRP holders globally disagree with the claim that the cryptocurrency is an unregistered security, as opposed to the small number in the Zakinov case.

Most people have hardly wrappe‚Ä¶ [+5806 chars]",CNBC,"Not six months ago, ether led a recovery in cryptocurrency prices ahead of a big tech upgrade that would make something called ""staking"" available to crypto investors.Most people have hardly wrapped their heads around the concept, but now, the price of ether is falling amid mounting fears that the Securities and Exchange Commission could crack down on it.On Thursday, Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, closed its staking program in a $30 million settlement with the SEC, which said the company failed to register the offer and sale of its crypto staking-as-a-service program.The night before, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned his Twitter followers that the securities regulator may want more broadly to end staking for U.S. retail customers.""This should put everyone on notice in this marketplace,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Friday morning. ""Whether you call it lend, earn, yield, whether you offer an annual percentage yield ‚Äì that doesn't matter. If someone is taking [customer] tokens and transferring to their platform, the platform controls it.""Staking has widely been seen as a¬†catalyst for mainstream adoption¬†of crypto and a big revenue opportunity for exchanges like Coinbase. A clampdown on staking, and staking services, could have damaging consequences not just for those exchanges, but also Ethereum and other proof-of-stake blockchain networks. To understand why, it helps to have a basic understanding of the activity in question.Here's what you need to know:What is staking?Staking is a way for investors to earn passive yield on their cryptocurrency holdings by locking tokens up on the network for a period of time. For example, if you decide you want to stake your ether holdings, you would do so on the Ethereum network. The bottom line is it allows investors to put their crypto to work if they're not planning to sell it anytime soon.How does staking work?Staking is sometimes referred to as the crypto version of a high-interest savings account, but there's a major flaw in that comparison: crypto networks are decentralized, and banking institutions are not.Earning interest through staking is not the same thing as earning interest from a high annual percentage yield offered by a centralized platform like those that ran into trouble last year, like BlockFi and Celsius, or Gemini just last month. Those offerings really were more akin to a savings account: people would deposit their crypto with centralized entities that lent those funds out and promised rewards to the depositors in interest (of up to 20% in some cases). Rewards vary by network but generally, the more you stake, the more you earn.By contrast, when you stake your crypto, you are contributing to the proof-of-stake system that keeps decentralized networks like Ethereum running and secure; you become a ""validator"" on the blockchain, meaning you verify and process the transactions as they come through, if chosen by the algorithm. The selection is semi-random ‚Äì the more crypto you stake, the more likely you'll be chosen as a validator.The lock-up of your funds serves as a sort of collateral that can be destroyed if you as a validator act dishonestly or insincerely.This is true only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network like Bitcoin uses a different process to confirm transactions.Staking as a serviceIn most cases, investors won't be staking themselves ‚Äì the process of validating network transactions is just impractical on both the retail and institutional levels.That's where crypto service providers like Coinbase, and formerly Kraken, come in. Investors can give their crypto to the staking service and the service does the staking on the investors' behalf. When using a staking service, the lock-up period is determined by the networks (like Ethereum or Solana), and not the third party (like Coinbase or Kraken).It's also where it gets a little murky with the SEC, which said Thursday that Kraken should have registered the offer and sale of the crypto asset staking-as-a-service program with the securities regulator.While the SEC hasn't given formal guidance on what crypto assets it deems securities, it generally sees a red flag if someone makes an investment with a reasonable expectation of profits that would be derived from the work or effort of others.Coinbase has about 15% of the market share of Ethereum assets, according to Oppenheimer. The industry's current retail staking participation rate is 13.7% and growing.Proof-of-stake vs. proof-of-workStaking works only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network, like Bitcoin, uses a different process to confirm transactions.The two are simply the protocols used to secure cryptocurrency networks.Proof-of-work requires specialized computing equipment, like high-end graphics cards to validate transactions by solving highly complex math problems. Validators gets rewards for each transaction they confirm. This process requires a ton of energy to complete.Ethereum's big migration to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work improved its energy efficiency almost 100%.Risks involvedThe source of return in staking is different from traditional markets. There aren't humans on the other side promising returns, but rather the protocol itself paying investors to run the computational network.Despite how far crypto has come, it's still a young industry filled with technological risks, and potential bugs in the code is a big one. If the system doesn't work as expected, it's possible investors could lose some of their staked coins.Volatility is and has always been a somewhat attractive feature in crypto but it comes with risks, too. One of the biggest risks investors face in staking is simply a drop in the price. Sometimes a big decline can lead smaller projects to hike their rates to make a potential opportunity more attractive.",2023-02-11

The emergence of the new variant was reported by a system administrator on an online forum, where another participant stated that files larger than 128MB will have 50% of their data encrypted, making the recovery process more challenging. Another notable change is the removal of the Bitcoin address from the ransom note, with the attackers now urging victims to contact them on Tox to obtain the wallet information. The threat actors ""realized that researchers were tracking their payments, and they may have even known before they released the ransomware that the encryption process in the original variant was relatively easy to circumvent,"" Censys said in a write-up. ""In other words: they are watching."" Statistics shared by the crowdsourced platform Ransomwhere reveal that as many as 1,252 servers have been infected by the new version of ESXiArgs as of February 9, 2023, of which 1,168 are reinfections.  Since the start of the ransomware outbreak in early February, over 3,800 unique hosts have been compromised. A majority of the infections are located in France, the U.S., Germany, Canada, the U.K., the Netherlands, Finland, Turkey, Poland, and Taiwan. ESXiArgs, like Cheerscrypt and PrideLocker, is based on the Babuk locker, which had its source code leaked in September 2021. But a crucial aspect that differentiates it from other ransomware families is the absence of a data leak site, indicating that it's not running on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model.  ""Ransoms are set at just over two bitcoins (US $47,000), and victims are given three days to pay,"" cybersecurity company Intel471 said. While it was initially suspected that the intrusions involved the abuse of a two-year-old, now-patched OpenSLP bug in VMware ESXi (CVE-2021-21974), compromises have been reported in devices that have had the network discovery protocol disabled. VMware has since said that it has found no evidence to suggest that a zero-day vulnerability in its software is being used to propagate the ransomware.  This indicates that the threat actors behind the activity may be leveraging several known vulnerabilities in ESXi to their advantage, making it imperative that users move quickly to update to the latest version. The attacks have yet to be attributed to a known threat actor or group.  ""Based on the ransom note, the campaign is linked to a sole threat actor or group,"" Arctic Wolf pointed out. ""More established ransomware groups typically conduct OSINT on potential victims before conducting an intrusion and set the ransom payment based on perceived value."" Cybersecurity company Rapid7 said it found 18,581 internet-facing ESXi servers that are vulnerable to CVE-2021-21974, adding it further observed RansomExx2 actors opportunistically targeting susceptible ESXi servers. ""While the dollar impact of this particular breach may seem low, cyber attackers continue to plague organizations via death by a thousand cuts,"" Tony Lauro, director of security technology and strategy at Akamai, said. ""The ESXiArgs ransomware is a prime example of why system administrators need to implement patches quickly after they are released, as well as the lengths that attackers will go to in order to make their attacks successful. However, patching is just one line of defense to rely on.""   Found this article interesting? Follow us on Twitter ÔÇô and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post. ",2023-02-11

The pre-installed operating systems on Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Oppo Realme devices are collecting people‚Äôs locations, call history, and profile information before sending it on to third parties, according to a¬†study from academics at the University of Edinburgh and Trinity College Dublin. The researchers conducted the research on phones bought in China and measured the network traffic the devices generate. In many instances, they write, people aren‚Äôt notified about the data that‚Äôs collected or given any choices to opt out. The study reiterates how different privacy rules are in China compared to many other parts of the world and the myriad ways people can be tracked. ‚ÄúThe data shared by the global version of the firmware is mostly limited to device-specific information,‚Äù the researchers conclude.Phishing Attack on Reddit Exposes Source Code, Some Employee DataReddit said on Thursday that hackers had accessed its source code after a successful phishing attack compromised an employee‚Äôs system credentials. The incident also exposed the contract information of hundreds of current and former Reddit employees and contacts. Reddit, which is owned by WIRED‚Äôs parent company Advance Publications, said that the incident did not impact user passwords or production systems, but suggested that users reset their passwords and ensure they have two-factor authentication turned on for their accounts. The company also said that the lessons it learned after suffering a data breach five years ago were protective and helpful in dealing with the recent incident.Most PopularCultureTaylor Swift and Beyonc√© Are Resurrecting the American Movie TheaterAngela WatercutterBusinessSam Bankman-Fried Built a Crypto Paradise in the Bahamas‚ÄîNow He's a Bad MemoryJoel KhaliliScienceHere‚Äôs the Truth Behind the Biggest (and Dumbest) Battery MythsGrace BrowneGearThe Best iPhone 15 Cases and AccessoriesJulian Chokkattu",2023-02-11

Now,¬†OnePlus, a Chinese manufacturer known for its speedy, solid smartphones, is throwing its own Android tablet onto the table. The company announced the OnePlus Pad this week, along with the second generation of its¬†Buds Pro bluetooth earbuds, and an all new¬†mechanical keyboard.The aluminum-bodied tablet looks to be a sleek addition to the often clunky world of Android tablets. Most notable is its 11.6-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 7:5. That‚Äôs odd for a tablet; most iPad screens are 4:3, which is the same as a classic television set. When you hold the OnePlus Pad in landscape mode, the tablet‚Äôs screen should be a little taller than you might be used to on a tablet.¬†There's a 13-megapixel camera on the back of the tablet (and an 8-megapixel selfie cam on the front). Photograph: OnePlusAlso notable is the matching keyboard that attaches magnetically, and the stylus for pen input. Both are sold separately. OnePlus claims the battery life is good for over 12 hours of continuous video playback; you can watch Seven Samurai three times plus a couple episodes of The Office before recharging.¬†It is available in one color (green) and will be available for preorder in April for an undetermined price. Hovering ominously in the background here is the notion that Google is expected to debut its newest Android tablet later this year, possibly in May.Here are some other stories from the world of consumer tech.NotflixLast week, Netflix accidentally leaked the news that it will crack down on password sharing. Then it hastily walked that back after a public outcry. But now Netflix has¬†officially announced it is implementing rules that prevent people who don‚Äôt live in the same home from sharing a single Netflix account. The unlucky first victims of this policy are subscribers in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal.In its announcement, Netflix detailed its plans for limiting account sharing. Now, anyone not living in the same household as the account holder will be prompted to transfer their profiles to a new paid account or be cut off. Netflix says the restrictions will roll out more broadly within months. It also said the service would ‚Äúrefine these new features based on member feedback.‚Äù As you might imagine, that feedback has been not great.The streaming service has been¬†building to this for a while now, testing out these restrictions in countries with a smaller customer base. The crackdown¬†hasn‚Äôt come for the US yet, but that it will seems about as likely as Netflix canceling one of its shows after a single season. (Which is to say,¬†very likely.)Apple Tests Buy Now, Pay LaterBuy-now, pay-later plans are all the rage, allowing customers to pay for stuff in interest-free installments rather than one bank-breaking chunk. Financial services like Klarna and Affirm have become very popular among cash-strapped consumers, who have even used them to buy food and holiday gifts. Of course, they‚Äôve got¬†some problems. (Who doesn‚Äôt love the idea of not paying full price and then potentially getting wracked by debt months later?)Apple is eager to get in on the BNPL game under its¬†own proprietary system, of course. Apple first announced the feature at its¬†2022 Worldwide Developers Conference, but it has yet to make its way to the public. Recently, Apple expanded its testing of the plan to¬†employees at its retail stores, a move that has often preceded other Apple service announcements. That seems to indicate that the broader rollout of its BNPL plan is imminent.The Crypto KeeperBack in the day, all the cool kid criminals used crypto. Blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin were hailed as an anonymous, untraceable means of payment. Aspiring lawbreakers could use crypto to buy even the darkest of dark web contraband with impunity, their identities shrouded in the mystery guaranteed by their means of payment. Or so many people thought.Turns out, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in fact entirely traceable. You just have to know where to look. And unfortunately for some crypto-carrying criminals, federal law enforcement officers knew exactly how to track them down.Most PopularGearThe Best iPhone 15 Cases and AccessoriesJulian ChokkattuGearGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office ChairsJulian ChokkattuGearHow to Use Your Phone Addiction to Actually Learn StuffJustin PotGearThe 20 Best Wireless Headphones for EveryoneParker HallThis week on¬†Gadget Lab, WIRED senior writer and author of the book¬†Tracers in the Dark Andy Greenberg digs into the cat-and-mouse game that is uncovering crypto cybercrime, and why even the people who depended on the complexity of crypto the most failed to understand the digital trail that it leaves behind.",2023-02-11

The hacker was able to target the protocol‚Äôs vault on Curve Finance, an automated market maker (AMM) platform operating on the Arbitrum and Optimism blockchains. The hack was brought to light by Twitter user @ZoomerAnon who tweeted that dForce had lost around $1.7 million through a series of flash loan transactions executed on the Optimism Chain. Blockchain security firm PeckShield confirmed the attack and put the damages at around 2300 ETH, worth around $3.65 million. DeForce also confirmed the attack on its official Twitter handle, adding that it had paused all vaults to avoid additional damage.¬†  ‚ÄúOn Feb 10, our wstETH/ETH Curve vaults on Arbitrum & Optimism were exploited, and we immediately paused all vaults. The vulnerability is identified, and the exploit was specific to dForce‚Äôs wstETH/ETH-Curve vault. Users‚Äô funds supplied to dForce Lending, and other vaults are SAFE.‚Äù  Details Of The Attack¬† According to the available details about the attack, the hacker was able to exploit a reentrancy vulnerability that was present in a smart contract function used by dForce to obtain oracle prices from Arbitrum and Optimism. Reentrancy attacks occur when a hacker is able to exploit a bug in a smart contract, allowing them to repeatedly withdraw funds, transferring them to an unauthorized contract. These attacks are known to occur on protocols that are linked to Curve Finance.¬† Blockchain security firm PeckShield explained that in the case of this attack, the hacker was able to manipulate the price of wrapped staked ETH in Curve‚Äôs vault (wstETHCRV-gauge) and liquidate several flash loan positions. So far, the funds are still sitting in the hacker‚Äôs account. DeForce has paused all contracts to prevent additional losses to the protocol and stressed that customer funds remain safe. DeForce also stated that the attacker had created a protocol debt of $2.3 million and also added that they would offer the attacker a bounty if the funds were returned.¬†  ‚ÄúWe have engaged with security firm @SlowMist_team and our ecosystem partners to further investigate the matter and would like to offer a bounty to the exploiter if the funds were returned. Stay tuned for further updates.‚Äù  Is DeFi A Soft Target?¬† The latest attack on dForce occurred two years after the protocol lost $25 million in a major attack on the protocol. However, the attacker returned nearly all of the stolen funds. While the most recent attack saw a significantly smaller amount stolen, it is the latest in a long line of attacks targeting the DeFi ecosystem, which is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in crypto. According to a report published by TRM Labs, over $3.7 billion were lost due to crypto hacks in 2022, with over 80% of that number from DeFi exploits.¬† The spate of hacks and the tremendous losses reported have obviously attracted the attention of regulators, which includes the European Union. Regulators have pledged to work towards introducing new policy changes to help improve DeFi oversight by regulatory bodies.¬† Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.Those hoping for a 2023 Bitcoin bull run will have to keep waiting. Most of the leading cryptocurrencies posted pronounced losses in value over the past week, putting a damper on the near-continuous market gains seen since the start of the new year.¬†ADADBitcoin (BTC) took its biggest intraweek loss of the year so far. The world‚Äôs top cryptocurrency by market cap sank 7.5% over the last seven days to $21,760 at the start of the weekend, according to CoinGecko data. Ethereum, the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap, sank 8.5% this week to change hands at $1,524 at the time of writing.¬†Much of the bearish sentiment this week stemmed from U.S. regulators, who have kept hawkish eyes on crypto in the wake of several high-profile bankruptcies last year from firms like Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX.¬†On Wednesday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that he‚Äôd heard ‚Äúrumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers.‚ÄùArmstrong then defended the practice of Ethereum staking, whereby anyone with 32 ETH (about $50,000) can lock up their coins and start mining Ethereum. The Coinbase CEO argued that this does not make Ethereum a security.¬†By Thursday, the rumors were confirmed when the SEC announced it had hit Kraken with a $30 million fine and ordered it to shut down its staking service. The implications of this enforcement action are far-reaching.As for the rest of the crypto market, one of the biggest drops in value among the top thirty coins this week came from Monero (XMR), a coin that facilitates private transactions. Monero sank 14% to hit $154 at the time of writing.¬†Avalanche (AVAX) similarly dropped by 13.5% and trades at $18.14 as of this writing. Popular memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) also dropped 13% and currently sits at $0.082035.ADADSolana (SOL) faced the stiffest losses among top cryptocurrencies and shaved 17% of its market value to trade at $20.85 on Saturday.¬†Holders of Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), and Toncoin (TON) all saw their bags drop by 8%.The only leading cryptocurrency that posted significant gains this week was the DAO token for crypto‚Äôs largest liquid staking protocol Lido Finance. LDO blew up 11% to $2.55 after the team released details of a major upgrade focusing on unlocking withdrawals on Ethereum and diversifying the network‚Äôs validators.¬†The upgrade still needs to be approved by a DAO vote, so LDO‚Äôs upward price action was likely spurred on by investors wanting to vote, in addition to those concerned about the future of Ethereum staking after the SEC's chilling action against Kraken. That move will likely continue to hang over crypto markets for weeks.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.Your EmailGet it!Get it!Copy link",2023-02-11

A lucrative corner of crypto thats fast becoming the lifeblood of the way many networks operate got a shock to the system this week.
The US Securities and E‚Ä¶ [+6445 chars]",Yahoo Entertainment,"(Bloomberg) --Most Read from BloombergChina Hits Back at US with Sanctions on Lockheed, RaytheonChina Warns of Retaliation Against US Over Balloon SagaASML Stolen Data Came From Technical Repository for Chip MachinesStocks Sink as Fed Officials Talk of Bigger Hikes: Markets WrapEx-JPMorgan Executive‚Äôs Jeffrey Epstein Emails Revealed in Lawsuit Against BankA lucrative corner of crypto that‚Äôs fast becoming the lifeblood of the way many networks operate got a shock to the system this week.The US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday signaled a crackdown on platforms offering rewards to their customers via a process called staking, as it reached a settlement with trading platform Kraken for $30 million and won agreement from the exchange to shut down those offerings domestically. It‚Äôs possible other providers such as larger rival exchange Coinbase Global Inc. may feel the heat and follow suit in discontinuing their own staking services, experts said ‚Äî or move them offshore.Staking allows users to lock up their coins on blockchains and help order the transactions that keep the protocols running, earning yields in return at an average of 7.7%, according to an estimate by data provider Staking Rewards based on 176 tracked assets.The ‚Äúproof-of-stake‚Äù method for running a network became a popular choice for developers in recent years, because it uses much less energy than so-called proof-of-work chains like Bitcoin and potentially allows more people to share in the rewards. Networks including Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, Cosmos and Polygon all rely on some version of staking to operate their chains, with Staking Rewards putting the global value of all staked assets at $91.8 billion as of Friday.Large exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase and Binance are at the heart of the staking-as-a-service industry, taking on the significant upfront cost and technical know-how for customers in return for a fee. Coinbase, one of the biggest providers of staking-as-a-service at $3.3 billion in value locked, was previously forecast to be in line for around $450 million in related revenue this year.Story continuesThe enforcement action against Kraken ‚Äúmay cause all retail-focused and US-based staking-as-a-service businesses to shut down their operations,‚Äù Christine Kim, research associate at Galaxy Digital, wrote in a note Friday, adding that Kraken and Coinbase account for nearly 20% of all staking on Ethereum combined. ‚ÄúIf the recent enforcement action by the SEC is, as it appears, targeted against all staking-as-a-service businesses in the US, this will have wide-reaching impacts‚Äù on proof-of-stake blockchains, she said.Network growthWhile Ethereum is the most well-known proof-of-stake network, it‚Äôs the smaller blockchains like Solana that may be hit the hardest by a sudden exit of big centralized exchanges from the US market. Staking is what makes these networks run smoothly, facilitating millions of transactions and also helping to improve security.The price of SOL, Solana‚Äôs native token, fell as much as 9.15% on Thursday following the SEC‚Äôs announcement.There are other staking providers ‚Äî less centralized services that claim to avoid concentrating oversight under a specific group, person or exchange ‚Äî but their interfaces aren‚Äôt user-friendly enough for many everyday investors.Read: US Staking Crackdown Seen as ‚ÄòGift‚Äô for Decentralized Services‚ÄúIf US crypto exchanges are not able to do custodial staking, we might see much more trend towards decentralization and self-custody,‚Äù added Lex Sokolin, chief crypto economist at Consensys. ‚ÄúHowever, that will also make it more difficult for very small accounts to participate in the security of networks, which is something we want.‚ÄùSuch platforms would need to rapidly improve their onboarding processes in order to keep up without a Coinbase or Kraken around, said Conor Ryder, an analyst at blockchain analytics firm Kaiko.ExchangesThere is a question of whether the SEC will target other exchanges like Coinbase that offer staking to customers. Eagle-eyed analysts, lawyers and policy experts pored over SEC Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs Thursday announcements, and largely came to the conclusion that it‚Äôs more a matter of how Kraken marketed its staking than the practice itself that is at issue.Specifically, the SEC alleged that Kraken‚Äôs terms of service transferred complete control of all staked tokens to the exchange and allowed it to ‚Äúdetermine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols‚Äù at its sole discretion. It also didn‚Äôt allow customers to have any insight into its overall financial health, which would help them make informed decisions about how likely it was that Kraken would pay the market-beating returns it advertised.As a publicly traded company, Coinbase provides such financial disclosures on a quarterly basis, Paul Grewal, its chief legal officer, said in a series of tweets on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt play games,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur customers have a right to their rewards. We can‚Äôt just decide not to pay any rewards at all.‚ÄùGalaxy Digital‚Äôs Alex Thorn, however, doesn‚Äôt see it the same way. ‚ÄúWhile Coinbase‚Äôs CLO refers to some of the specifics of Kraken‚Äôs program and argues that it‚Äôs those specifics that made Kraken‚Äôs product a security and not Coinbase‚Äôs, it appears both from the complaint and the press release that the SEC isn‚Äôt making such a distinction,‚Äù Thorn said.Access to revenue from staking services is vital for exchanges such as Coinbase at the moment, stuck in a bear-market environment where low volumes and increased competition have served to crimp the trading fees earned from general crypto buying and selling. Platforms like Binance have sought to mop up what‚Äôs left of consumer demand by reducing such fees to zero, placing the burden on other revenue streams to fill the gap.‚ÄúAn SEC settlement with Kraken, shuttering its staking operation, puts this entire growth pillar at risk for Coinbase,‚Äù said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Paul Gulberg and Jamie Douglas Coutts in a note Friday. Coinbase shares fell 14% on Thursday, and Gulberg and Douglas Coutts forecast a 35% downside to its predicted staking revenue this year.The unintended result of Gensler‚Äôs crackdown could see some validators move offshore in order to continue servicing non-US customers, a transition that would likely cause increased risk of consumer harm if investors are tempted to access non-regulated products, according to Ryder.‚ÄúThis is only going to hurt US businesses that are involved in crypto, this isn‚Äôt going to do much to protect the average investor,‚Äù he said, adding that he doesn‚Äôt believe staking rewards meet the requirements needed to be categorized as securities. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I don‚Äôt think the SEC has much jurisdiction here, and it‚Äôll just be something that will harm US customers and see the innovation move to Europe and Asia.‚Äù--With assistance from Olga Kharif.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekZantac‚Äôs Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsThe World‚Äôs War Machine Is Running Low on AmmunitionAiming to Be the Next Emirates, Air India Makes Record Jet BuyPutin‚Äôs War Is Crippling Ukraine‚Äôs Economy‚Äîand Russia‚Äôs, TooChina‚Äôs ‚ÄòZero-Dollar‚Äô Tourists Are Getting a Cautious Welcome¬©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",2023-02-11

They discuss China√¢¬Ä¬ôs reopening as a source of growth and consider what it might take to launch the next bull market in global equities. Hugo: Hello, Olga. We√¢¬Ä¬ôve walked together through a tumultuous 2022, and now we√¢¬Ä¬ôre ready to peer into 2023. As you consider all the variables, what are you trying to forecast? What actually matters for investors? Olga: Good question, Hugo. The world of investment has both excited me and humbled me. For global equity investors, what√¢¬Ä¬ôs important is to identify broad trajectories of growth and inflation rates, and then to forecast turning points, or changes in those trajectories. We assess the main factors that we think will affect where earnings growth is likely to head over one year or several years. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm much less interested in precision; I think it√¢¬Ä¬ôs a fool√¢¬Ä¬ôs errand to put too much faith in point estimates. Hugo: I√¢¬Ä¬ôm especially interested in what you said about turning points. What looks different to you this year in terms of where we might find growth? Olga: Well, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs start by identifying a couple of macro variables where I think we√¢¬Ä¬ôre going to have a shift. And hopefully that will lead us nicely to where you and I think growth might be. The first trend reversal we need to talk about is the Fed funds rate. The U.S. central bank is likely to stop tightening in 2023, perhaps in the first quarter, keeping rates stable around, in our view, 4.5% to 5%. Since we√¢¬Ä¬ôve been tightening for most of the past year, that will be a notable change. The second likely big reversal is the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-√É¬†-vis other major currencies. If it materializes, that will be a sharp change in trend from the past several years of massive appreciation of the dollar. Interacting with both of these potential shifts is China√¢¬Ä¬ôs reopening. It looks as though we√¢¬Ä¬ôre going to have another year of asynchronous post-COVID reopening. As a result, we are likely to get not only a boost in production but perhaps also a short-term boost in consumption and growth in and outside of China. China√¢¬Ä¬ôs consumption today is 5-10% below the pre-COVID trend. As global investors, we need to think about the impact of 200 or 300 million Chinese consumers being able to travel again, which reminds me of the reopening frenzy that we saw in 2021 elsewhere in the world. China√¢¬Ä¬ôs reopening is probably going to be the biggest source of growth this year. Hugo: I√¢¬Ä¬ôm thinking about how China√¢¬Ä¬ôs reopening could affect global inflation, and it reminds me of the expression that the ball always bounces more than once. So, over the past couple of years, inflation rose, and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) followed with its series of interest rate hikes. Then inflation rolls over in the United States, if things play out the way we expect, and the Fed likely stops hiking. But now, China reopening probably increases the demand for energy, which was a meaningful contributor to inflation in 2022. Doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt that create, then, a second inflationary pulse? Olga: I agree with you there, in terms of the ball bouncing more than once. Right now, inflation is moderating, and I think the trend in the United States is pretty well set. In Europe, almost all of the inflation was due to bouncing energy prices and, more broadly, commodities. But I would venture that a lot of the run-up in energy prices had less to do with the demand for energy and more to do with an existential risk to Europe that energy wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be available in the quantity that it needs. At that point, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs almost no price that is too high. This, incidentally, is what I think propelled the dollar to the dizzying heights that we saw in 2022. That existential risk is likely off the table, barring some other geopolitical catastrophe. By and large, we have plenty of oil, and we have even more plentiful natural gas. At this point, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs a question of price, not a question of availability. We don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think that China√¢¬Ä¬ôs reopening increases global demand for oil and natural gas beyond 4% to 6% above what was consumed last year. That alone probably wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be a driver of significant price increases in 2023. By √¢¬Ä¬úsignificant√¢¬Ä¬ù I mean commodity price increases large and durable enough to reverse consumer inflation trends in the United States and in Europe. However, I think China√¢¬Ä¬ôs reopening also will create demand outside of China. In Japan, Korea, Thailand, Australia, but even farther afield - so Europe, Canada, the United States - all of these places are likely to see an influx of demand from tourists, from folks visiting their loved ones that they haven√¢¬Ä¬ôt seen in years. I think that travel will buoy domestic demand in these countries, and it also will probably improve the current account positions in a number of these places. Japan and Thailand are most notable here, but probably Europe to a lesser extent, maybe even Canada. That improvement could be the impetus for further weakening of the dollar vis-√É¬†-vis these major currencies. To your point on inflation, what we may end up seeing is stronger underlying demand that shows up in fits and starts and results in still-moderating but more volatile domestic inflation in places such as the United States and Europe. Of course, in real time, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs difficult to disaggregate which part of that demand is coming from domestic residents consuming more because their income is stronger, and which part is coming from tourism. That dynamic will probably complicate monetary policy for the central banks. So that√¢¬Ä¬ôs how we see China√¢¬Ä¬ôs reopening impacting growth around the world - through changes in domestic demand in some of these countries, and through still-decelerating but more volatile inflation. Hugo: The strength of the dollar is one of the dominant themes of the past 10 years, so what you√¢¬Ä¬ôre saying about a weaker dollar is reversing one of the supercycle themes that investors have come to rely upon. You said the point of forecasting is to predict big changes such as this one. What√¢¬Ä¬ôs your model for how to think about investing around a weaker dollar? Is there another period of history that we can look to as an analogue? Olga: That√¢¬Ä¬ôs a really good question, and we have spent a lot of time thinking about this one. I rarely answer your questions directly, but this time I will, so I may score points where I can. The period that we look to be entering in the 2020s is most reminiscent of the last what I would call √¢¬Ä¬únormal√¢¬Ä¬ù expansion that we experienced, which was 2003 to 2007. A lot of the changes that we√¢¬Ä¬ôre highlighting today are exactly the same macroeconomic setup as we experienced then. Back then, the dollar was moderating. It was losing value relative to the euro and the Japanese yen. At the same time, on the policy side, interest rates in the United States were moving up. The Fed funds rate increased from 1% to 5.25%, while the U.S. 10-year note stayed in a relatively narrow band, somewhere in the 3.5-4% range. That period of economic expansion was extremely fruitful for equities. We saw equities markets returning around 15% on average during that entire time period, and virtually all of that performance was driven by earnings growth. Obviously, the types of companies that lead the charge this decade are likely to be different. But the broad macroeconomic environment may very well end up being similar. Hugo: It was put to me that the next bull market will begin when the following conditions are met. The first is that the darlings of the previous bull market - big tech, high growth - are derated sufficiently, such that investors no longer view them as outperformers. The second is that there√¢¬Ä¬ôs some kind of credit event caused by this steep slope of Fed tightening. The third is that the dollar breaks. Are you forecasting that the dollar will break? If so, does that get us to the conditions for the next bull market in global equities? We√¢¬Ä¬ôve had a derating of some of the best-performing equities in the last bull market. We√¢¬Ä¬ôve seen the repricing of credit as well, caused by the yield curve changing. And then, if investors are hiding in a strong dollar, and that breaks, you kind of have the forest fire. You reset to get ready for the next bull market. Do you agree with that? Olga: It√¢¬Ä¬ôs not a bad theory to work with. As you√¢¬Ä¬ôve just identified, we already have at least two of the three conditions, and possibly all three. In terms of a major credit event, these are devilishly difficult to forecast. Obviously, the more the Fed raises rates from here, the greater the probability of such an event. We√¢¬Ä¬ôve had a series of smaller credit events in 2022, so some of the weaker sovereigns have already defaulted and have asked for International Monetary Fund (IMF) help. We√¢¬Ä¬ôve also had the crypto explosion, and there are criminal charges. The value of the bitcoin trade is roughly a third of what it was at the beginning of 2022. So we√¢¬Ä¬ôve had some shakeout already. None of these feels like a whale. But I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt know if we need a credit event of the magnitude that people evoke when they talk about the 2008 global financial crisis. The shakeout in the consumer-facing technology platforms that have been dominant in the past decade is definitely giving way to something. Now, what is that something? Are we on the cusp of another commodity supercycle? Maybe we need a lot more lithium and nickel if we√¢¬Ä¬ôre all to be driving electric vehicles by the end of the decade. U.S. scientists recently announced a major breakthrough in nuclear fusion, a technology that people have been excited about since the √¢¬Ä¬ô50s. Might that be a catalyst for growth? COVID has exposed all sorts of vulnerabilities in the superefficient supply chains. We may see more duplication and production for the domestic markets that are closest to you. We√¢¬Ä¬ôre starting to see companies talk about that. And, of course, what underpins growth in virtually every sector today is semiconductor chips, and the materials and the technologies that go into making ever-better chips for the next level of computing, whether it√¢¬Ä¬ôs quantum computing or something else. The example that I√¢¬Ä¬ôve been thinking about a lot recently is 5G buildout. We all saw what kinds of business models were enabled by the improvement in connectivity from 3G to 4G, such as streaming entertainment on our phones and ride-sharing services. What are we likely to see when we finally move to 5G? Are we going to get that in healthcare? Are we going to get that in industrials? For now, I see no obvious candidates to lead the next bull market, but it almost certainly won√¢¬Ä¬ôt be the winners of the past decade.

Introduction As will be thoroughly demonstrated in this post, Canada has been duped and conned to an unfathomable extent, having become entangled in this folly that is the Russia-Ukraine War. Entire pieces of Canadian legislation have been enacted by our foolish, ignorant, and self-serving politicians on the back of lies and deceptions perpetrated by conniving, war-mongering actors which are currently being weaponised and have already led to devastating consequences for the Ukraine, Europe as a whole, as well as our great nation. Everything surrounding this war is not as it appears, and the masses ‚Äì including our ignorant politicians ‚Äì have been shrewdly duped and fooled into supporting it and further propagating the utter geopolitical mess that has resulted. 2. Canada‚Äôs Sanctions on Russia (Sergei Magnitsky Law) and its implications on private property ownership Though legislation has already been passed (and amended) in Canada which set the legal provisions and means by which foreign officials and entities can be sanctioned, i.e., have their assets seized and forfeited, it will be demonstrated hereunder that these have been established based on lies that were further amplified by Canadian officials, including Chrystia Freeland, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. On February 2nd, 2023, Canada, through its Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Melanie Joly, imposed further sanctions against Russian individuals based merely on the ‚Äúopinion‚Äù that these individuals had direct involvement in the country‚Äôs invasion of the Ukraine. Canada has imposed various sanctions against Russia for what they deem was the country‚Äôs unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. The type of sanctions vary widely and range from ‚Äúpeddling misinformation and propaganda‚Äù, to human rights violations, and for being ‚Äúelites and close associates of the regime‚Äù, though corroborating evidence is almost never provided in their sanction documents. Activist Post is Google-Free Support us for just $1 per month at Patreon or SubscribeStar This month‚Äôs sanctions precede another notable one that occurred in December of last year whereby Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich had his assets seized under the same laws. The key laws in question here include the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA) created in 1992 and the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law) from 2017. Though these laws have been around for a while, they are constantly amended and it is also worth noting that last year, Bill C-19, sponsored by Chrystia Freeland, was passed through both the House of Commons and the Senate which gave significant new powers to the aforementioned key laws. In short, according to Fasken, a business and litigation law firm which has been operating in Canada since 1863, C-19‚Äôs amendments appear to be in direct response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of the Ukraine and aims to work with its allies to take steps to ‚Äúfind, restrain, freeze, seize, and, where appropriate, confiscate or forfeit the assets‚Äù of persons who have been sanctioned in connection with the invasion.‚Äù The dangers, however, are basically twofold. First, it creates a dangerous precedent for asset seizure and forfeiture regardless of the nationality of individuals or entities. In other words, anyone who is placed on a Sanctions List (for whatever reason deemed valid by the Governor in Council upon a government official‚Äôs recommendation) ‚Äì even Canadians ‚Äì could find their assets (cash, property, etc.) seized and forfeited (sold) with little legal recourse and due process. When asked by a reporter about Bill C-19 and seizing and selling Russian assets, Canadian Justice Minister David Lametti stated the following which confirms this current predicament: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have an absolute right to own private property in Canada.‚Äù  ""You don't have an absolute right to own private property in Canada,"" says Liberal Justice Minister David Lametti when asked about seizing and selling off Russian assets. pic.twitter.com/fdlaQ5LtSK ‚Äî Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) June 8, 2022  Secondly, it is poised to act as a strong deterrent to foreign investment into Canada; for, companies may see it as political and economic risks should their home country or even their own corporate positions differ in their political stances than those of Canada and its major allies. This very sentiment was also noted by Fasken: ‚ÄúConsequently, acquiring companies and those seeking to enter joint ventures are on notice to have sanctions clarity on beneficial ownership of corporate targets or partners. Sanctions due diligence and risk arises not only regarding activities abroad, but to wholly domestic transactions involving foreign beneficiaries who have assets in Canada.‚Äù 3. Canada‚Äôs Sergei Magnitsky Law & the United States‚Äô Magnitsky Act are based on lies But perhaps what is most concerning about the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA) and the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law) and related amendments are the lies and deceptions upon which they were devised. More specifically, we need to look at the Sergei Magnitsky Law (Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act) that was passed in 2017. What is most notable and telling is the name of the act itself ‚Äì Sergei Magnitsky [Law]. Who was Sergei Magnitsky? Sergei Magnitsky was a Ukrainian-born Russian tax advisor who was arrested and died in a prison in Russia under allegations of fraud. Magnitsky is mostly remembered due to Bill (William) Browder, an American-born businessman and CEO of Hermitage Capital Management, who had hired him as a tax consultant for managing his business affairs in Russia.     It is important to note that Bill Browder lobbied American officials, including Senator John McCain, to pass the legislation which eventually became the Magnitsky Act of 2012. In Canada, it was a Canadian senator of Ukrainian origin, Raynell Andreychuk, who introduced Senate Public Bill S-226 which eventually became the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law), formally ‚ÄòAn Act to provide for the taking of restrictive measures in respect of foreign nationals responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights and to make related amendments to the Special Economic Measures Act and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act‚Äô.     Bill Browder (2nd from left) and Senator Raynell Andreychuk (far right). Image source: Latvian National Federation in Canada ‚Äì Human Rights and Magnitsky Legislation in Canada, November 3, 2017.    A November 2022 article by Canadian author Matthew Ehret titled The Lies of Bill Browder & the Magnitsky Hoax and accompanying interview with journalist Lucy Komisar provides overwhelming evidence surrounding the events that led to the passing of the Magnitsky laws. The article commences as follows [emphasis and links added]: ‚ÄúIn this Canadian Patriot Podcast, Matt Ehret speaks with renowned award winning journalist Lucy Komisar on her groundbreaking exposure of Bill Browder‚Äôs fraud in Russia and internationally, as well as the truth of the Magnitsky Hoax that underlies the virulent new technique of economic warfare that has been used to target ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù politicians with a focus on taking down Russia‚Äôs leadership.‚Äù To save the reader time from having to listen to the meticulously referenced details from the hour-long interview, here are some key highlights with links added to supporting evidence:  Komisar describes Bill Browder as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most brilliant con man.‚Äù Browder was connected to a scam in which a Russian titanium company, AVISMA, was involved in an illicit transfer-pricing scheme via an Isle of Man shell company. Browder illegally purchased millions of dollars worth of shares in Gazprom (not allowed to foreigners) through shell companies which lead to him and Sergei Magnitsky being investigated for related tax evasion upon which he was supposed to pay $40 million. With the help of his accountant Magnitsky, Browder set up the Hermitage Fund which was involved in many illegal activities, including evading paying billions in taxes. Komisar describes the ‚ÄúBrowder-Magnitsky Hoax‚Äù as a first pillar of Russiagate (an elaborate scheme to discredit and vilify Vladimir Putin and the Russian federation). Both Browder and Magnitsky were charged with tax evasion in Russia. Magnitsky was jailed, but Browder managed to flee the country. Had the due taxes been paid, Magnitsky would have been freed. Komisar refers to the German documentary film The Magnitsky Act Behind the Scenes. Komisar refers to three separate NGOs that observed prison conditions and Magnitysky himself. The first, by the Russian Public Oversight Commission for Human Rights Observance, found no proof of torture; the second, Physicians for Human Rights from Cambridge (Massachusetts) to which Browder had given documents (via Hermitage), issued a report which attested to no claims of beatings or torture; and the third, from the European Court of Human Rights, also didn‚Äôt back up Browder‚Äôs claims that Magnitsky had been tortured and beaten to death.  The above represents a very tiny summary of the wrongdoings and false claims Bill Browder has made on behalf of himself, his corporate interests in Russia, and regarding his Ukrainian-born Russian tax advisor Sergei Magnitsky. Renowned journalist Lucy Komisar has extensively and meticulously investigated and documented Bill Browder‚Äôs countless crimes, lies and deceptions. Here are some key resources for the reader who wishes to assess the materials any further.  Regis Tremblay interview with Lucy is a primer on the Browder hoax, Dec. 12, 2022 Browder hoax as the beginning of Russiagate: interview on The Backstory, April 8, 2022 Archives: The Browder Hoax (many articles) Audio & Video archives  The following brief account by Lucy Komisar also provides a simplified summary about Bill Browder‚Äôs fraud and the purported basis upon which the Magnitsky Act was founded:   Of particular importance and relevance to Canada, Lucy Komisar re-posted an October 2022 letter¬† by investigative journalist Adrian duPlessis, a veteran forensic investigator of corporate fraud and malfeasance, to the Toronto Chartered Financial Analysts Society regarding their guest, Bill Browder, to their 65th Annual Investment Dinner Sponsors. The expert investigator is no amateur, as he outlines his credentials in a preface to his letter: ‚ÄúFor decades, teamed with accountants, lawyers, police, journalists, victims ‚Äì I‚Äôve done my best to track, expose and stop harms to individuals and society. Records of those cases in which I‚Äôve been involved can be found ‚Äôround the globe in court registries and media archives such as those of: Canada Stockwatch, The Vancouver Sun, The Globe and Mail, The Financial Post, Equity, Macleans, BC Business, The Financial Times of Canada, CBC fifth estate, CTV W5, HVG, Time, Forbes, Barron‚Äôs, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, US News & World Report, Businessweek, ABC TV Primetime Live, The Observer (Guardian), The Economist, Channel Four Dispatches, BBC Panorama, ABC Radio Background Briefings and dozens+ more such sources.‚Äù Adrian duPlessis is also an author and the recipient of a National Newspaper Award for his work with David Baines whilst at the Vancouver Sun. The following passage regarding Bill Brower also prefaces his letter [with emphasis added]:           ‚ÄúThe geopolitical racket which Browder and co. are in now can lead to terrible harm. If he was restricting himself to stealing money, evading taxes, and engaging solely in pecuniary crimes, much as I‚Äôd object to the corruption, it‚Äôs so much a feature of our society/culture, I‚Äôd not wade in to the fray. Manipulating our lawmakers, our press, interfering with governments, Interpol, stoking tensions between nuclear powers ‚Äì yup, I‚Äôm back in.‚Äù The outspoken former forensic investigator could not hold back when he heard that Bill Browder would be speaking before the CFA in Toronto. The October 27, 2022 letter, addressed to the CFA Society Toronto brings to the attention of all concerned with the event with the subject ‚ÄòRe: 65th Annual Investment Dinner: ‚ÄúGeopolitical Risk with Acclaimed Author and Investor, Bill Browder‚Äô. Without diving into the specifics of the letter, suffice it to say that duPlessis outlines and links to dozens of court documents and references that confirm the numerous misrepresentations of Bill Browser in his financial dealings in Russia and regarding his claims of torture directed towards his partner Sergei Magnitsky. One such reference is that of Der Spegiel‚Äôs follow-up article retorting all of Browder‚Äôs false assertions. Another resource confirms his corruption with the aforementioned Avisma entity which Lucy Komisar had also outlined. The list seems endless and also includes a resource, jaccuse.news, that outlines six pages packed with documents, videos, witness statements, news articles, and so on which further detail Mr. Browder‚Äôs extensive transgressions. Adrian duPlessis ends the letter by showing the CFA/Toronto event sponsors which include Canadian financial behemoths RBC Global Asset Management, BMO (Bank of Montreal), TMX Group (Toronto Stock Exchange & TSX Venture Exchange), Desjardins, among others, asking ‚ÄúDo CFA members audit these companies?‚Äù The rhetorical question is surely to mock their ignorance regarding having the financial master fraudster Browder as a key spokesperson to their event. Bill Browder‚Äôs critics are certainly not limited to Komisar and duPlessis, either. 4. Politicking our Canadian MPs for war profits It‚Äôs no secret that politicians from all around the world get lobbied, influenced, bribed, coerced, aligned, or else incentivised to cater to whomever will get their attention and support.

The US Treasury Departments Office o‚Ä¶ [+3376 chars]",Activistpost.com,"By The Cradle US officials and Western media have tried to portray sanctions as harmless, despite the impact they have had on humanitarian assistance for Syria. The US Treasury Department‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on 10 February issued a temporary waiver for Caesar Act¬†sanctions¬†imposed on Syria to allow¬†earthquake¬†relief funds to reach the country, following days of hindered humanitarian efforts. The Syria General License (GL) 23, issued by OFAC, authorizes earthquake relief transactions ‚Äì which would typically be restricted under the Syrian Sanctions Regulations (SySR) ‚Äì for a period of 180 days.      ‚ÄúOur deepest condolences go out to the people of T√ºrkiye and Syria for the tragic loss of life and destruction in the wake of devastating earthquakes,‚Äù Deputy Secretary of the US Treasury Department, Wally Adeyemo, said. ‚ÄúAs international allies and humanitarian partners mobilize to help those affected, I want to make very clear that U.S. sanctions in Syria will not stand in the way of life-saving efforts for the Syrian people. While U.S. sanctions programs already contain robust exemptions for humanitarian efforts, today Treasury is issuing a blanket General License to authorize earthquake relief efforts so that those providing assistance can focus on what‚Äôs needed most: saving lives and rebuilding,‚Äù he added. The decision followed a storm of criticism, as many have called out the impact of US sanctions on the¬†humanitarian situation¬†in the country, particularly on¬†relief efforts¬†following the devastating earthquake. Bassam Sabbagh, Syria‚Äôs permanent UN envoy, said on 8 February that international cargo planes have been ‚Äòrefusing‚Äô to land in Syrian airports due to the threat of sanctions. However, others have justified US sanctions and claimed that they do not restrict humanitarian efforts or aid provision in any way, despite repeated UN warnings over the years and in the last few days following the disaster. However, many have pointed out that the sanctions are designed in a way that intimidates countries against dealing with the Syrian government, making it so that even when aid is involved, those who want to assist usually refrain from doing so due to the high risk of US consequences. Senior US officials have said in the last two days that they will continue to refuse coordination with Damascus in any way, even going as far as calling it ‚Äúcounterproductive.‚Äù      Significant new positive initiatives from Washington that demonstrate how the Administration is increasing aid to Syrians in need, no matter where they live, The Treasury has just issued GL 23 to to support earthquake relief efforts in #Syria ====> https://t.co/X6xicNKO9n ‚Äî EHSANI22 (@EHSANI221) February 10, 2023  Washington claims to be working ‚Äòon the ground‚Äô to provide aid through its NGO ‚Äòpartners,‚Äô however, even US-based crowdfunding platform GoFundMe has canceled fundraising campaigns of local Syrians affected by the quake who are attempting to raise money for relief.           The fact that the US Treasury Department decided to officially issue a temporary waiver for the Caesar Act serves as proof that Washington‚Äôs sanctions indeed do pose a threat to humanitarian efforts.

Jump Crypto noted:‚ÄúBugs that allow infinite minting of native assets are some of the most critical vulnerabilities in Web3.

Update (11:25am ET): On Friday, the IRS¬†said¬†filers in 17 states needn‚Äôt report special payments from those states on 2022 tax returns:¬†California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, F‚Ä¶ [+3963 chars]",Activistpost.com,"By Tyler Durden Update (11:25am ET): On Friday, the IRS¬†said¬†filers in 17 states needn‚Äôt report special payments from those states on 2022 tax returns:¬†California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The IRS said special payments received by Alaskans aren‚Äôt federally taxable either, clarifying that this is the case ‚Äúonly for the supplemental Energy Relief Payment received in addition to the annual Permanent Fund Dividend.‚Äù In Georgia, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia, things are more complicated: ‚ÄúState payments will not be included for federal tax purposes if the payment is a refund of state taxes paid¬†and¬†either the recipient claimed the standard deduction or itemized their deductions but did not receive a tax benefit.‚Äù      You really have to hate that 16th Amendment.¬†¬† * * * The IRS has advised millions of Americans in 22 states to delay filing their tax returns, while the agency tries to figure out if certain 2022 payments from those state governments are federally taxable or not. At issue: state rebate checks that some people received from¬†Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia. Easiest way to get your first Bitcoin (Ad) The Tax Foundation‚Äôs Jared Walczak says the IRS should have sorted this out long ago: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfair to taxpayers that we‚Äôre more than a week into February and still don‚Äôt know what millions of them are supposed to put on their federal tax returns. This could have‚Äîand should have‚Äîbeen avoided.‚Äù The IRS‚Äôs overdue homework assignment is complicated by the lack of uniformity in the nature of these one-time payments from nearly two dozen states. Qualifications for the payments varied. For example, Florida‚Äôs and Rhode Island‚Äôs focused on families with kids, and only front-line workers qualified for Minnesota‚Äôs.     Many, like California‚Äôs, were characterized as a ‚Äúmiddle-class tax refund‚Äù to counter inflation. That could put them in a different ‚Äî and thus taxable ‚Äî category, as compared to pandemic relief or welfare payments. Alaska‚Äôs was cast as additional proceeds from the state‚Äôs Permanent Fund Dividend that residents receive annually. ‚ÄúThere are a variety of state programs that distributed these payments in 2022 and the rules surrounding them are complex,‚Äù said the IRS in a statement¬†posted last Friday, Feb. 3. ‚ÄúWe expect to provide additional clarity for as many states and taxpayers as possible next week.‚Äù However, ‚Äúnext week‚Äù is almost over, and the IRS still hadn‚Äôt provided any new guidance as of Thursday evening. ‚ÄúFor taxpayers and tax preparers with questions, the best course of action is to wait for additional clarification on state payments rather than calling the IRS,‚Äù the agency added.¬†The IRS says that if you‚Äôve already filed, you shouldn‚Äôt amend your return.¬† TurboTax apparently thinks it knows the answers ahead of the IRS, with a spokesperson telling The New York Times that based on ‚Äúcurrently available information‚Äù and the firm‚Äôs ‚Äúexpertise,‚Äù it‚Äôs concluded the rebates aren‚Äôt taxable at either the state of federal level, and isn‚Äôt telling users to pump the brakes. By urging delayed filing, the IRS is imposing costs on many people, starting with foregone interest and use of money while Uncle Sam continues holding funds that will eventually be refunded when returns are filed.           Advisors recommend filing earlier in the cycle, to help thwart criminals who may claim a refund using your identity. Alas, rebate recipients in 22 states have to wait for the criminals in Washington to sort out the particulars of their own extortion racket first.¬†¬† Source: ZeroHedge Become a Patron!

Both Thales and Idemia are involved in both EU digital wallets pilots and rumored interest in a lucrative contract in DRC.¬† A FIDO Alliance event forecast a big year ahead for passkeys, just as Socure joined the group. Digital identity evolution in Kenya and the UK also made the most-read articles on Biometric Update. Top biometrics news of the week The UK government has revealed plans to charge private digital ID providers for certification to the trust framework, but largely cover other costs of the system through DCMS‚Äô governance function. The comments came among its response to the 270 comments received in consultation on the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework.      A contract for a biometric ID card will soon be tendered by DR Congo, with an estimated $428 million value. Thales, Idemia and Veridos are rumored to be preparing bids, and Pangea and Dermalog have won multi-million dollar contracts in the country over the past year. The project was put on hold in 2020. Kenya‚Äôs new government has announced plans to clear its backlog of applications for biometric passports, having received 50,000 blank booklets and with 200,000 more on the way. It also advanced plans to speed up citizenship and residence document issuance and develop its UPI as a birth-to-death identity system. The pilots for the EU Digital Identity Wallet include a series of consortia made up of big-name technology providers like Visa, Idemia, and in two different cases, Thales. Aligning the levels of assurance provided across the continent could be a stumbling block, however, as could fragmentation. Easiest way to get your first Bitcoin (Ad) The OpenWallet Foundation is set to launch an open-source engine for building digital wallets, and discussed its plans in a Linux Foundation Europe panel at the World Economic Forum. The OWF has grown from 3 to 350 member organizations, providing some hope that it will be able to meet its goal of ensuring digital identity interoperability. Passkeys were in the spotlight at the Cybersecurity Policy Forum hosted by Better Identity, the FIDO Alliance and ITRC, where panelists suggested they could begin eliminating passwords for users in a range of different environments and applications this year. With MFA bypass attacks on the rise, FIDO ED and CMO Andrew Shikiar sees consumers and businesses like moving towards local biometrics. The newest members of the FIDO Alliance are Socure and AuthenticID, which get a chance to contribute to the passwordless authentication group‚Äôs identity verification standards. Bitwarden, meanwhile, has increased its participation in FIDO to the sponsor level.     The use of facial authentication by Russia‚Äôs financial institutions is explored in a guest post by a trio of authors from Metrica B‚Äôs Inoface brand. Biometrics are being used by over 200 banks in Russia for access control, branch security, payments and loyalty programs, they write. UNICEF Director Cornelius Williams said during the latest ID4Africa livecast that 20 African nations are on track to meet UN SDG 16.9 by issuing universal legal identity for all by 2030. He was speaking during a conversation on civil registration that also included UNECA‚Äôs Oliver Chinganya, who called out the need to put an economic value to civil registration data. The latest annual report from the World Bank‚Äôs ID4D initiative estimates that there were 850 million people remaining without ‚Äúofficial‚Äù identification in the world as of 2021; a little over half of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The totals represent progress since 2018, but it has been uneven. Startup Wink has raised $3 million in seed funding to put facial authentication for passwordless access control not just onto phones, but also POS terminals, IoT devices, and automobile consoles. The company has been rapidly raising money to advance its vision for decentralized biometrics.

Indeed, in recent months, natural gas prices have erased much of last year√¢¬Ä¬ôs exceptional gains buoyed by Russia√¢¬Ä¬ôs war in Ukraine, partly due to an unusually warm winter. That in turn could bode well for bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners because lower energy/electricity prices would boost their profitability, which largely depends on their ability to secure cheap power.  Another major source of miners√¢¬Ä¬ô profitability is the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD), the downward momentum of which over the last year has been unfavorable for the troubled industry. Year-to-date, though, the token has notched notable gains, climbing around 30% as of Friday afternoon.  These dynamics appear to have partly been reflected in many of the nine publicly-traded bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners√¢¬Ä¬ô January statistics analyzed by Seeking Alpha. The average bitcoins mined surged 18.3% from a month ago, while the average hash rate increased 5.0%, as seen in the table below. Note that Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ:HUT), Greenidge Generation Holdings (NASDAQ:GREE) and Sphere 3D (NASDAQ:ANY) have yet to publish their January numbers.  On a less positive note, the so-called difficulty of bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining, a measure of how hard it is to mine a new block for the blockchain, was at an all-time high of 39.35 trillion as of Feb. 6 versus 34.09 trillion in the month-earlier period, according to Blockchain.com data. While a higher difficulty suggests the network is more secure against attacks, it also means that more computing power is required to mine the same number of BTC blocks, in a move that hampers miners√¢¬Ä¬ô profitability. That said, the bitcoin network√¢¬Ä¬ôs estimated hashrate, which measures how much computing power is being used to process transactions on the blockchain, stood at 277.49M terahashes per second (TH/s), down slightly from its 295.09M TH/s record high on Jan. 29 and up from 270.91M Th/s a month ago.  There are, however, some positive developments to look forward to, chiefly the upcoming bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event, in which the reward for mining BTC transactions gets cut by 50%. In theory, the number of new bitcoins entering circulation (token supply) declines while demand stays the same, thus the price of bitcoin should climb. BTC halving occurs every four years (or every 210K blocks) and the next one is estimated to take place some time in 2024. √¢¬Ä¬úIf it√¢¬Ä¬ôs anything like previous cycles, then the √¢¬Ä¬òhalvening√¢¬Ä¬ô should have a positive narrative effect on bitcoin (BTC-USD) demand,√¢¬Ä¬ù Bendiksen pointed out.  √¢¬Ä¬úAfter the halving, we probably need to be moving into the $30K√¢¬Ä¬ôs, at least, for a lot of the miners to be comfortable,√¢¬Ä¬ù he added, while noting miners have different cost bases. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) changed hands at $21.72K at the time of writing.  For bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners, √¢¬Ä¬úthe name of the game is still going to be survival,√¢¬Ä¬ù Bendiksen contended, as some miners like Greenidge (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining (NASDAQ:SDIG) are in the midst of restructuring debt.

In this episode, James, Nick, and Akiba engage in a lively discussion about the current state of Bitcoin nodes and the impact of Taproot. The topic of discussion is a bit concerning as Akiba jokes that James seems to be drifting towards Bitcoin Cash, a topic that the hosts aim to dispel quickly.James shares charts on Twitter that highlight the recent surge in the adoption and utilization of Bitcoin, which has skyrocketed since November 2022. With an all-time high adoption rate of 7.5% and utilization rate of 2.8%, there has also been a significant increase in the use of Taproot scripts, now at almost 3% compared to 1% in mid-January.Nick then explains the purpose of Taproot and its significance in the Bitcoin network. He explains that the reason behind the block size increase and the introduction of Taproot was to allow for more complex scripting and to clean up multisig transactions. Taproot allows for more privacy by generating a spending script that looks like a normal transaction, making it difficult for Chainalysis to identify the multisig transaction. The implementation of Taproot has taken a while due to the time it takes to build more complicated scripts.However, the noise around Taproot has primarily been centered around NFTs. Akiba asks if Taproot is going to be remembered as the implementation of NFTs, and Nick explains that it is due to the recent attention that NFTs have been receiving. Despite the potential challenges that NFTs pose to the Bitcoin blockchain, smart engineers are working on resolving these issues.In conclusion, this episode of BitTalk offers valuable insights into the current state of the Bitcoin network and the impact of Taproot.

Source: SHIB/USDT on TradingView At press time, BTC struggled to reclaim its $22K zone. Similarly, SHIB faced difficulty closing above the 61.8% Fib level of $0.00001269. With a bearish structure, as indicated by the RSI, SHIB could retest the 50% Fib level.¬† Such a move would allow investors to benefit from a short-selling opportunity at $0.00001216.

The Wall Street Journal recently published a letter in which the CEO remarked on the SEC‚Äôs role as well as its impact on the industry. Grayscale CEO Condemns SEC‚Äôs One-Dimensional Approach for Stopping BTC‚Äôs Progress He noted to have acknowledged a claim that the securities regulator was considerably late to prevent FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy and the crypto regulation. He added that this is due to the one-dimensional method of the regulatory agency for the regulation of cryptocurrency. Michael Sonnenshein, on his official Twitter account, remarked on the present operations of the securities regulator.  He is of the view that the SEC should attempt to eradicate the bad actors within the crypto world. However, he added, the regulator should not pose hurdles to the endeavors focused on forming adequate regulation. At present, Grayscale is confronting SEC by suing the regulator for refuting its Bitcoin trust‚Äôs transformation to a spot ETF (or exchange-traded fund). As per Sonnenshein, the enforced regulation by the regulatory agency to prevent malicious actors from invading the crypto market has even stopped the advancement of Bitcoin into the regulatory perimeter of the United States. He said that this has compelled US investors to utilize the crypto businesses which operate offshore. As a result, they are not comprehensively protected and have deficient oversight. Grayscale‚Äôs CEO disclosed that they are witnessing the result of the SEC‚Äôs preferences. The US investors are suffering to pay for the priorities set by the securities regulator. The opinion of Sonnenshein is witnessed at a time when Grayscale is suing the SEC for randomly refuting the strategy of Grayscale to transform its GBTC (or Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) to a spot exchange-traded fund. It was argued by the SEC that the proposal of Grayscale did not adequately shield against manipulation and fraud. While responding to this, the platform stated that the regulator was making an illogical treatment with spot-traded goods as opposed to futures-traded products. The owner of Grayscale is Digital Currency Group (DCG) ‚Äì a prominent crypto conglomerate that is presently experiencing diverse financial difficulties. DCG additionally possesses the bankrupt company Genesis Trading. The SEC accused Genesis on the 12th of January of supposedly offering unregistered securities. A few days back, John Reed Stark (former SEC chairman and a crypto skeptic) criticized the use of word enforcement for the regulatory measures taken by the SEC. He categorized this terminology to be a huge bogus catchphrase utilized by the crypto proponents. In a post published on the 22nd of this month on LinkedIn, Reed noted that this is an ill-advised deflective endeavor structured to support the anti-regulatory mores. In his words, it was completely nonsensical. Reed argued that enforcement and litigation are the components of the operation of securities regulation. Grayscale submitted the lawsuit to confront the SEC back in 2022‚Äôs July.  A Crypto Trader Expresses Apprehensions over Grayscale‚Äôs Potential Collapse Scott Melker ‚Äì a crypto trader as well as the host of the podcast named ‚ÄúThe Wolf of All Streets‚Äù ‚Äì cautioned about Grayscale. He considers that the rare episode of Grayscale‚Äôs collapse would ignite a ripple effect throughout the crypto market. As per Melker, such an event will trigger a huge selling event specifically for the primary crypto asset Bitcoin (BTC).  ",2023-02-11
