On the Saudi side, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stated only recently that he seeks “a good and special relationship with Iran…We do not want Iran’s situation to be difficult, on the contrary, we want Iran to grow… and to push the region and the world towards prosperity.” From the Iran side, a high-level delegation conducted lengthy meetings with Saudi counterparts shortly after that statement was made in a secret summit in Baghdad brokered by Iraq Prime Minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi. Iraq, for its part, is playing a crucial role in this rapprochement announcing in tandem with these recent events that Baghdad will establish a joint US$6 billion with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to invest in various projects in Iraq. This was quickly followed by news that a Saudi oil firm, with significant U.S. intelligence and logistical support – Delta Oil Company – is in talks to develop Iraq’s highly strategic Akkas gas field, alongside U.S. oil services giant, Schlumberger. Whether this series of announcements means that Saudi Arabia is set to decisively join the Iran-China-Russia sphere of influence or that Iraq is set to join the Saudi-U.S. one remains as yet unclear but Iraq announced further enormously significant tie-ups with Saudi Arabia in the past few days. According to a comment from Iraq’s Oil Minister, Ihsan Ismaael, lengthy discussions took place last week between him and Saudi counterpart, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, over how best to allow for much greater involvement by Saudi companies in Iraq’s gas, petrochemical, and clean energy sectors, including substantial investment by the Saudi firms across these areas. The specific companies involved in the discussions were heavyweights in their respective industries. Saudi Aramco, SABIC, and also ACWA Power were all involved, whilst the Iraqi side was compromised of various key government ministries and representatives for the National Investment Commission. According to a senior source who works closely with Iraq’s Oil Ministry spoken to exclusively by OilPrice.com last week, these discussions began with a reiteration of the Saudi interest in developing Iraq’s highly strategic Akkas gas field, which was previously eyed by Russia as a key element of a triangle of such sites strategically running across Iraq and into Syria. Akkas is not only situated in an area controlled by Iraq’s Sunni minority but also is a vital component of Iraq’s move to better optimize its own gas resources in order to minimize its dependence on Iran for gas and electricity supplies. In addition, Saudi Arabia stated that it was extremely interested in developing the Ratawi gas field, as part of a broader plan to utilize the huge volume of associated gas produced in the development of Iraq’s oil resources that is currently flared.    Related: Not All Electric Vehicle Companies Are Created EqualThe use of this flared associated gas either by capturing it for export (and providing a much-needed boost to Iraq’s black hole of a budget) or by utilizing it for power generation (and reducing Iraq’s dependence on neighboring Iran for gas and electricity supplies) has long been a focus of U.S. policy for Iraq. Not only would those developments mean that the U.S. could reduce its financial aid to Iraq but also that it would significantly lessen one of the key levers of influence that Tehran has over Baghdad. As it stands, Iraq still ranks as one of the worst three offenders for flaring associated gas in the world, after Russia, burning off around 16 billion cubic meters of associated gas last year. This practice has cost the economy billions of dollars in lost revenue, has contributed to the frequent power outages in Iraq, particularly during the summer months, and has also run counter to the spirit of the United Nations and World Bank ‘Zero Routine Flaring’ initiative aimed at ending this type of routine flaring by 2030 that Iraq joined in 2017. It is true that Iraq pledged earlier this year to finally develop its associated (and non-associated) gas resources in the next two to three years, with the Oil Ministry looking at projects to develop 1.2 billion standard cubic feet per day (scf/d) of associated gas out of the 2.7 billion scf/d produced as an adjunct to oil excavation. It also said that it planned to develop a number of standalone gas fields, beginning with the combined estimated 700 million scf/d of production of Akkas and Mansouriyah. It is also true, though, that Iraq has been saying these things for at least the last 17 years with the intention of keeping U.S. financial aid flooding in whilst continuing to do nothing, except rely on Iran to keep its lights on.  Despite the inertia of the Iraqi authorities, however, the progress made on utilizing the otherwise flared gas by foreign firms, Royal Dutch Shell and Mitsubishi Corporation, working with Iraq’s South Gas Company, in the US$17 billion 25-year Basra Gas Company (BGC) project would encourage the Saudis. Began in 2013, the BGC currently captures associated gas from the three major oil fields of Rumaila, West Qurna 1, and Zubair, and in December 2018, BGC reached a peak production rate of 1035 mmscf/d. This was the highest in Iraq’s history and sufficient gas to generate approximately 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of electricity - enough to power three million homes. BGC currently supplies 70 percent of Iraq’s LPG, and through expansion of its export capabilities, helped turn Iraq from a net importer to a net exporter of LPG as from 2017. Interestingly, and a sign of what can be achieved in Iraq – given the country’s huge resources but without any of the usual dodgy dealings – BGC and CitiBank signed a first credit agreement in February 2019, the first commercial loan extended by CitiBank to an Iraqi corporate entityRelated: How An Oil Pipeline Hack Sent Bitcoin Prices TumblingSaudi Arabia is also ideally placed to move forward with using associated gas, using part of that massive volume of gas to kick-start Iraq’s equally long-stalled petrochemicals sector. The key project here has always been the Nebras petrochemical complex, with the original design for it formulated between Shell and the Iraq Ministry of Oil and Ministry of Industry and Minerals in 2012 for a project that could produce at least 1.8 million metric tonnes per year (mtpa) of various petrochemicals. This would make it Iraq’s first major petrochemical project since the early 1990s and one of only four major patches complexes across the entire country. The others - Khor al-Zubair in the south, Musayeb near Baghdad, and the Baiji refinery complex in the north – are operated by Iraq’s State Company for Petrochemical Industries.    The major advantage that Saudi would have in advancing the Nebras project – as it said last week that it wanted to do – is that the earliest design plans for it came from the templates used by Russian companies in the early development of Saudi Arabia’s gas and petrochemicals sector, particularly in the creation of the country’s flagship Jubail Industrial City. “Ethane needs to be the initial feedstock for Iraq’s first few plants in the same way that it was in the development of Saudi Arabia’s master gas system that captured associated gas, which was then fractionated and supplied as primary feedstock to the flagship Jubail Industrial City,” the head of petrochemicals projects for a major international oil company operating in Iraq exclusively told OilPrice.com. “The highest concentration of ethane [10 percent plus] is usually found in associated gas streams, which Iraq has a lot of, and processing ethane produces ethylene with few by-products [mainly fuel gas] to process and manage,” he told OilPrice.com. “This reduces the capital required for construction and minimizes the complexity of the logistics and distribution requirements, which will be important factors in Iraq’s early-stage build-out of a viable petchems industry, but as the industry and corresponding infrastructure grows, heavier feed streams can be utilized, as happened with the use of propane, butane, and naphtha in Jubail,” he said. A world-scale facility for ethylene – one of the most in-demand petchems products in the world, especially from China - is in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 million tons of ethylene production and a 1.0 million ton per year ethylene facility would require a supply of roughly 1.3 million tons per year of ethane, he highlighted. “Additionally, this would need to be a sustainable and reliable supply for at least 20 to 25 years and, to build out all of the necessary parts for a functioning world-class petchems sector in Iraq would require around US$40-50 billion,” he concluded. By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.com ADVERTISEMENT      More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Markets Baffled As The IEA Calls For More ProductionGoldman Sachs Doubles Down On $80 Oil PredictionMiddle East Oil Prices Rise As Global Demand Recovers  ",2021-06-15

This includes ECB President Christine Lagarde, who earlier this year blasted Bitcoin’s “funny business” in facilitating money laundering, and U.S Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who pointed out Bitcoin’s limitations as a payment mechanism, and much like Lagarde, its use in illicit financing. “To the extent it is used I fear it’s often for illicit finance. It’s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.” Nonetheless, the Swiss-based international organization for public-private cooperation has signaled its approval of cryptocurrency via its latest guide.

They raise concerns over the WEF’s role in steering the world recovery. Among the WEF’s predictions by 2030 is “you’ll own nothing. And you’ll be happy.” Some have described this future scenario as a centralized system of control and manipulation. Even a throwback to Medieval feudal society, which consisted of a bottom rung of the peasantry who were slaves to the landowners. Reuters have fact-checked this “stated goal” and dismissed it because it was a reference to the trend towards the prevalence of renting over ownership. “False. The World Economic Forum does not have a stated goal to have people ‘own nothing and be happy’ by 2030. Its Agenda 2030 framework outlines an aim to ensure all people have access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property.” Either way, should investors take the WEF’s mention of Algorand, Cardano, Celo, XRPL, Solano, and Stellar as cryptocurrency projects to watch in the future?

So welcome to the next session of the 23rd Annual Credit Suisse Communications Conference. I'm Doug Mitchelson, Credit Suisse analyst covering media and cable, satellite and telecom sectors. For those map into, a little vote going on this month for the sell-side, vote early, vote often. Remember, itâs a team effort here at Credit Suisse. And particularly, I'd like to acknowledge the excellent conference team and who work tirelessly to put all this together. Thrilled to have with us today Bob Chapek, CEO of Walt Disney Company, 28 years now with Walt Disney, and another big kind of long. Format, fireside chat. I have enough questions, run a full session. Bob, thank you so much for spending some time with us today and we'll jump right in. Bob Chapek Thanks, Doug. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Doug Mitchelson So, look, you stepped into the CEO role right in the deep of the pandemic, have had a busy, busy first 16 months, NFL deal, Star launch, much more. You're able to put your initial stamp on the company though with the segment realignment. So thereâs a lot to talk about. Let's start from a high level. As we emerge from the pandemic, what Disneyâs strategy to create value for its various stakeholders and what does the management team have to get right to deliver that value? Bob Chapek So I would start by saying that despite the challenges of the last 18 months or so, we're as optimistic as ever about the future of our business. As you had referenced, we instituted a reorganization to support our more aggressive push into direct-to-consumer. And most importantly, that guaranteed strong, steady content flows into all of our channels of distribution based on our strong brands and our incredible franchises. That's really our biggest competitive advantage. At the same time, I think our more mature channels of distribution are ensuring those strong cash flows. So we want to keep those things healthy, so that we can continue to make the kinds of investments that are necessary to achieve our goals in direct-to-consumer. And then we want to distribute those pieces of content in ways that really embrace both the changing consumer behavior that we're seeing, and obviously, the more short-term, but very important recovery from COVID and do that with a certain flexibility and balance between both short-term operating performance and long-term shareholder return. In terms of our other big piece of our business, our parks and experiences business, we've really used the shutdown in order to fully reconsider, let us say, every aspect of our operation to not only improve our guest experience, but at the same time, manage our yield and accelerate the work that we've been doing in that yield management area for about the last five, six, seven years. And we're happy so far, because we've seen some really encouraging underlying demand as we went into COVID. And we've got the -- I think the ultimate test and the ultimate situation for yield optimization experience, so that we can commercialize that demand, but also at the same time, improve that guest experience without having to necessarily put more people in the park in order to grow our business. So at the same time though, I think we've really continued to invest in our intellectual property, despite COVID in our parks given that strong historical ROIC that you know we've had in our parks investment and the plethora of storytelling opportunities that we have across our business. Doug Mitchelson So before we delve into all that, I did want to ask sort of one more big picture question, which is whether Disney has got the right mix of assets? And I think about, do all these assets have a purpose being together? Do you have the right amount of scale on each of them regardless of what happens around the company in terms of consolidation or deconsolidation as the case maybe? Bob Chapek Yes, we're really happy with our portfolio of assets and then the ecosystem that commercializes those assets. Storytelling, as you know, Doug, is at the heart of everything that we do. And again, we have that enviable group of brands and franchises that I think is really the envy of the entire industry. So let's witness the last couple of weeks, because an example maybe the best way to sort of to talk about this. First, we opened up the Avengers Campus at Disneyland Resort, and that's gone spectacularly well. And then we've premiered Loki on Disney+. And both of those obviously being part of the Marvel ecosystem, and I think that just shows how across different businesses, across times and across geography, we can use the strength of our franchises across these distribution assets and really make the best out of it.  And then we have the opportunity to do that on a global scale more than ever, not only because of the legacy distribution channels that we have, but also because of the newer direct-to-consumer distribution channels that we have across the globe. So we really think that right now we've got sort of -- at least in terms of today's environment, we've got the right balance, the right scale as you say, to really take those brands and franchises, which again, is the framework underneath what supports everything at The Walt Disney Company. That's our foundation. And so we're very happy with our asset mix. Doug Mitchelson Right. That makes sense. And next - sorry, ever since he started the Brand Council at Disney in the late 90s, Bob Iger talked about this as area closer to the consumer, at the time when you had the parks in your time there, but the rest of the company was essentially a wholesaler until streaming launched. And so my question is, you've developed more direct relationships with more and more consumers around the world, that could have meaningfully influenced strategy or revenue, and when would we start to see any impact to The Walt Disney Company? Bob Chapek Well, as you said, our parks businesses have a longstanding direct relationship with our guests. And with our direct-to-consumer business now we have the opportunity not only to grow that audience, but the frequency of engagement and look at the touchpoints that we've got in order to drive, let's call it, new connections between those previously separated businesses. And you have to keep in mind that when Disney+ really launched and started to get traction, we had to shutdown our parks business. So this is really the first time we've ever been able to operate in parallel, both our parks business and our direct-to-consumer business, which is giving us the opportunity really to cross-market and -- those two businesses across lines of businesses. So we think that we've not even begun to scratch the surface, if you will, that cross-collateralization of market data and mining that in a way that's going to benefit our business and our shareholders. Doug Mitchelson You talked about the parks and where you have those direct-to-consumer touchpoints. Next generation might not grow up watching the Disney Channel, it might be wrong to say, but it's hard to get their eyes unglued from their screens when they got more viewing options than ever. How do you capture the attention and the imagination of the next generation, keep the magic of the Disney brand going? I was thinking sort of, relative to the allure of the parks, perhaps this broadens out to all of the company's products and services. Bob Chapek Well, keep in mind, given our new reorganization, the creatives that might make what we would have considered our great Disney Channel content in the past are now making our young family content across the entire ecosystem. So whether or not that content may appear first on Disney Channel or may appear first on Disney+, we still got the same talented people that are in that space that know how to speak to that audience that have had the tremendous legacy of success, making content for that audience through Disney Channel, now are making it regardless of distribution channel for our Disney+ platform. So, we always look at our businesses through two lenses, both obviously the media side and the experience side, and we get to leverage then all that great content that's been made through both of those avenues and leveraging the common brand and the common franchise affinity that we're able to do that. And because of the four-quadrant appeal of our content, it then gives us benefits on Disney+, which is a four-quadrant outlet, even more. It gives us more advantages than going to something like a Disney Channel, which would be -- maybe a little bit more limited in terms of its overall appeal. So, we think that whether it's new content or library content, it really gives us the ability to take that ecosystem that we have, take the skill that we have in terms of those great creative people and apply it in a more broad, more general sense to appeal to a wider audience. Doug Mitchelson That makes sense. And so let's keep going on the park side of that, where you personally led $20 billion of capital investments before becoming CEO. Well, it seems thereâs a lot coming up, your 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World, new cruise chefs, developing Shanghai, which is still sort of relatively young, five years old, building out every park globally. Could you just update us on the experiences that are sort of coming up in the next five years, especially ones that might add to revenue capacity? Bob Chapek Sure. Sure. Well, we've got ambitious plans to expand our business. I had just mentioned Avengers Campus a second ago, and we're encouraged by the great response we have there, but we're not stopping there because as you know, we've been undergoing a massive transformation of our Epcot Park at Walt Disney World in Orlando. And we've got a Ratatouille attraction that we're bringing in, that first premiered in France. We've got a new nighttime show Harmonious that'll be on the water there at Epcot, and it'll be a huge guest pleaser. And then we've got our Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind attraction, our coaster that will give us our ability to bring that whole Marvel franchise into the park. Internationally, we're thrilled to bring Zootopia into Shanghai Disney Resort. You mentioned Shanghai, that's obviously a property that did extraordinarily well in the box office once Zootopia came out, so that'll be a big hit in Shanghai. We've got Frozen installations coming into Hong Kong Disneyland. At Disneyland Paris, we've got the twofer of its own Avengers Campus, taking off from where Anaheim has, just the recent launch Avengers Campus. And we've also got The Art of Marvel Hotel that we're putting in. We're installing Tokyo Disney Resort. We've got the eight themes port over at Tokyo DisneySea. We've got two new hotels and attractions going in for Frozen, Tangled and Peter Pan. And then we've got three new ships and a second island destination.  So we certainly have a plethora of new things coming, and that's really mining all the work that we had done prior to the pandemic and kept working on during the pandemic, so that we would not have any sort of glitch in our supply chain of new attractions and experiences for our guests, so we can keep that growth engine of parks going. Doug Mitchelson Yes. I mean now you've always been so excited about the outlook for parks and you talked a little bit earlier about honing out those yield management skills during the pandemic. You've talked previously about structural changes to operating costs, you also mentioned that earlier. So we have all increased capacity, smarter pricing, lower cost structure, it certainly seems like parks will deliver margins looking out few years well above its prior peak. Is that fair to say? Bob Chapek Yes. I think we're optimistic about our margin story going forward. We expect our admissions per cap to continue to benefit from our, let's call it, database pricing models that we've moved to over last couple of years, and strategically managing our attendance across different ticket types. As you know, Doug, thereâs significantly different outcomes depending on what type of ticket package a guest historically has come into our parks with. And by managing that as a percentage of the whole, we have a significant opportunity to obviously improve our outcomes. And this pandemic is giving us the opportunity to completely reconsider how we do that. On the cost side, we've done things like dramatically in the interest of sort of contactless guest experience during the COVID time. It dramatically improved our mobile ordering opportunities in the park, contactless check-in at our hotels, virtual queues. We're really using those. So it sort of releases the guests more to do things inside the park and enjoy the park, have a better experience, but also have an opportunity to experience more things, and that obviously has a revenue impact for us. And then just to manage the guest flow in the overall experience, so you can have the same number of people or more people in the park, but at the same time, give them a better experience. And these are all things that frankly without the stoppage of COVID, we never would have had a chance to completely reset like we've done. So I think the margins have a chance to have an impactful, if you will, recovery, but long-term we're going realize some margin benefits from sort of being able to implement all these, given the COVID shutdown? Doug Mitchelson All right. So still with the parks. But lastly, are consumers coming back? And how does the demand look overall?  Bob Chapek Yes. Our forward-looking reservations are really strong at our domestic parks, and we're seeing also strong underlying demand at our Disney Cruise Line in terms of what we're seeing from consumers. And that's, by the way, despite the pause, the uncertainty about the cruise industry and the frankly limited marketing that we've done so far. And as you know, we're going to be releasing a new ship next year, called The Disney Wish, and we're seeing strong response to the inaugural season of that. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing across those businesses, as the COVID restrictions get released and the case counts go down and governments release their constraints on us, whether they're local or federal CDC type guidelines. And we want to open it up responsibly and we want to do so in a way that's going to maintain that guest experience. Doug Mitchelson Well, letâs shift over to content, not to leave myself or perhaps you for that matter. When we first met back in sort of 2008, a while ago, your focus was on home entertainment and driving the DVD marketplace. And one thing that really sort of sticks with me to this day, behind your energy was just how intuitive you were with the content being created and how aggressive your reshaping and how that content was being distributed? And so what are the big changes in your first year as CEO? You mentioned earlier, re-segmenting the company, a separate content creation for distribution. So any bumps in the road implementing that new structure and all the new reporting lines on the content side of the house and what's the experience been so far? Bob Chapek   Despite how profound that change was for us relative to how we operate and particularly how the industry operated, it's really gotten very strong by our execs. Obviously, a lot of socialization and collaboration went into that before we did that. But I think everyone appreciates the clarity and accountability and the fact that as we now double down on our content investment going forward as we announced in our December investor conference, everyone appreciates the fact that they've got more time to do what they do best, given this increase in output that we have. We're ramping up scale in this new content, and it really enables on the other end, on the distribution end for let's call it, an objective assessment for what's right for distribution for our company from an enterprise level, given those changing consumer preferences over time.  I've always said that the ultimate asset test for this reorganization would be our first five-year plan, because remember everything we've done up until now has really been a plan that was set years ago, right, before this new organization was contemplated. So we were essentially living with an old plan operating it under a new organizational model. But now with the new five-year plan, we actually get a chance to plan from this point going forward with this new conceit and with this new structure.  And I must tell you, I've been extraordinarily pleased with how well it's gone and how well everything's worked. So I think that bodes well for the future in terms of the impact of this new organizational structure on our goals to dramatically accelerate our DTC business.  Doug Mitchelson I think I said 2008 but I meant 1998. Probably sure stuck with 2008. Can you maintain quality while increasing the pace of content manufacturing? What's your level of confidence in the upcoming slate? You had a record-setting run pre-pandemic.  Bob Chapek Well, we certainly have a strong legacy in the past of great content driving really great business results, but I have to say that I'm encouraged going forward as well. We've always said that we're going to focus on quality over quantity and maintain that high betting average that Disney is known for, extraordinarily high betting average, in fact. And I think what we're seeing is that, is increasing demand is really empowering our creatives to think outside the box from maybe more limited slate and try new different things like we've done, for example like WandaVision or Loki. Really taking a different approach that if you were more constrained to only stay at three or four projects a year, you might not want to give it a shot. And I think that's actually been empowering and liberating for our creatives. So it's actually worked quite well.  Our creative teams are all focused on their franchise now. For example, in the past, the Marvel teams, which arguably are the best and most qualified to create Marvel content, made Marvel movies, but they didn't do Marvel television. Well now Kevin Feige and his team are not only making Marvel movies, but they're making all the episodic Marvel content as well. And this is part of what happened in this recent reorganization, which I think makes all the sense in the world. So, -- and with the expansion of streaming now, people like Kevin get to branch out, not only in terms of the degrees of freedom that they've got in their storytelling to do things that are different, but also different mediums, different timeframes, two-hour movies, two and a half hour movies, but also episodic series that lasts for roughly an hour. So it really is liberating for the creatives. And I think we're seeing the dividends from that.  Doug Mitchelson Now, Iâm not sure if this a question or a statement to bring out. I had an important Marvel fan asking me, if you could please bring Ironman back.  Bob Chapek Well, tell your Marvel fan that we've got a series called Armor Wars coming up, starring Don Cheadle as War Machine. And I think that will probably scratch the itch that our fans have for more Ironman.  Doug Mitchelson How much more of IP is there to mine on the Marvel side, I think recalling Disney acquired Marvel as skeptics thought, Spiderman, Hulk and probably good stuff within licensed. Obviously you created massive new franchises in Guardians and Black Panther and you got Shanghai and Eternals coming, you got new series coming to Disney+. What your creative team is the most excited about? Bob Chapek Well, always learn not to underestimate our creative teams, particularly our Marvel creative teams. We've got 8,000 characters that we have to mine and youâd say, well, 8,000 characters, who knows what these 8,000 characters are? But remember that all of our Avengers, for example, our Avengers characters, where we made the acquisition, weren't exactly household names, take Loki for example, Loki was the most watched season premier, ever on Disney+ during its opening week. And no one knew who Loki was, even when we started -- that started on this journey on Marvel, no one knew who Iron Man was, or Wanda or Vision or Falcon or the Winter Soldiers, Black Widow, Shang-Chi, nobody knew who these characters were. They certainly know them now. And I think that speaks to the fact that our creatives really can take something in this universe, in this mythology and really bring it to life through interconnected tissue and interconnected storytelling.  And not only are these series great, but we've got three feature films in the next six months. So I think proof is being demonstrated that as you increase output and you go deeper, deeper into mining the Marvel mythology, that it doesn't have to sort of tap itself out because as we've been able to demonstrate, we've got great stories to tell and we're telling great stories. And by the way, now with the Fox acquisition, we have things like Fantastic Four to add into that. So I see it's pretty much an endless opportunity for us.  Doug Mitchelson So let's shift over to the distribution part of that content story. And historically you put content out to theaters, retailers like Walmart and then B2B companies. Disney's always enjoyed leverage associated with having the importance of the company's content. Now there's connected TV platforms like Roku and Amazon and Apple and Flex forming. They want to help you get costumers, which is great. How would you contrast this sort of shift in distribution with how it was before? Are you concerned that they might become gatekeepers in the future and start to eat away content economics over time and sort of throwing it all in there? What's your vision for content distribution when you look out 5 or 10 years? Bob Chapek Yes. I think the vision is really getting closer and closer to the consumers. You made a reference to how we started this whole process of when we started our direct-to-consumer initiative earlier? It's really about having a granular understanding of what the consumption patterns are, and then speaking to the consumers in a way that's going to be relevant to the content that they want specifically for themselves. And by doing so we'll drive engagement and consumption.  In terms of actually the relationship that we have with our distribution partners, the key is having a win-win, having a strong symbiotic relationship, and that's what we've got, as they really want Disney content and we bring that value to their platform. So as long as we have a symbiotic relationship where we bring something they need, we get something that we need. It's a healthy relationship. And with the wide variety of content that we have in our machine, I think we'll continue to have that very positive, very productive, very symbiotic relationship.  Doug Mitchelson So let's turn over to the pricing side of that content distribution. So consumers historically paid a premium for Disney's offering, that happens with parks, that happens with cruises, that happens with video. Disney+ was arguably very, very attractive, level of historic initial demand particularly in the United States and the services, subscriber success has been impressive as a result. So how much value do you feel you're delivering at this point in time to consumers with this service? What's the path to rightsizing pricing over time to capture that value? And just to give the U.S. example of where you had a recent price increase of about $1. Does $1 a year get you there in a reasonable amount of timeframe relative to the value of delivery? Bob Chapek Yes. In terms of, I guess, an objective way to look at the price value relationships, the growth rate that we've experienced on Disney+ sort of stands out as the headline there. But you're right, we did launch at a very attractive price value opening point. And the first price point -- or first price increase that you mentioned in first 16 months happened recently, and weâve seen no significantly higher churn as a result of that. And in Europe, as a matter of fact, we took a price increase twice as high as we took domestically more or less. And we -- that was with -- commensurate with the integration of the Star brand as a six-brand tile. But our churn actually improved, right? So we took an even higher price increase and our churn improved, because we added more content.  And I think that investment in the content at attractive price point gets you strong retention and strong retention obviously is one of the key factors towards overall platform growth. But that doesn't mean that in the future, as we continue to add more and more great content, that we wouldn't necessarily reflect that in the value that we add and then price it accordingly. So we think there's some room there as well. Doug Mitchelson Do you see the potential for Disney+ to evolve into a platform that company can sort of leverage beyond its current, call it, offering of video streaming. So for example, do you envision, including consumer products, connections to your parks, gaming et cetera, what does Disney+ look like to consumer in 5 or 10 years?  Bob Chapek Well, our franchise machine is really important to us and we're always evolving it and employing our franchises in the best way possible to benefit our business across line of business, across geography and across time. And we believe, as I mentioned earlier, that our direct-to-consumer business will and now enables sort of new connections if you will. So, what we want to do is start to marry our databases and mine those things. And frankly, we're very ambitious about our thoughts about how we can do that in ways that we've not yet been able to do it, whether it's because of COVID or because we just got through our launch. I mean we're just now getting to the point. Keep in mind, we're still sort of in the launch phase across the world of Disney+ and some of the more refined ways of thinking about this so that we can manage just as an ongoing concern and do what we do best, which is to operate our businesses. So we've had a great launch, but it's been under far less than ideal circumstances. Well, those more normalized circumstances are coming and we're going to get to do what we do best, which is to operate our business in a way that benefits the consumer, our shareholders and we're just getting started.  Doug Mitchelson And I've got as you might imagine, a couple more follow-ups on that. Again, notwithstanding that you still have part of the world about to launch. I'm still sort of curious about the long-term strategy here. And I think from a video streaming standpoint, do you envision Disney+ having an advertising supported entry to your around the world? Certainly audiences around the world are used to seeing the Disney Channel advertisements, which is different than what you have in the United States.  Bob Chapek We're always reevaluating how we go-to-market across the world, but we've got no such plans now to do that. We're happy with the models that we've got. But again, we won't limit ourselves and say no to anything, but right now we have no such plans for that.  Doug Mitchelson And the other part of that was, I wanted to ask about taking the brand tiles that you haven't serviced with more of an a la carte format, because I think Disney is relatively unique in terms of the number of standout brands that you could even do something like that. So, for example, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, instead of as part of just you get all of this with the Disney+ service, have you thought about sort of selling each of those on a la carte basis? And the rationale would be, you could expand consumer choice, you could broaden out the subscriber base and allow Disney to price and sort of resource its product based on the value of each brand, each genre sort of more specifically in that format, And if not, do you still see this as sort of continue to offer in the United States Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu on a standalone basis? Do you think it'll be all one offering at some point in time like Netflix is today?  Bob Chapek I think our more aggregated model right now is serving us well, and I also believe it's serving our guests well. It gives us a very nice price value, which we just talked about being so key to our excel -- ourselves. And also gives us efficiencies versus having to market. Let's say, if we have five brand tiles, five different offerings at the same time, that would get pretty expensive from a marketing standpoint. But again, it also has some benefits with our customers in terms of being able to give them a wide offering. Because there is sort of a large overlap between people that like Marvel versus people that like Star Wars and people that like Disney.  Now, the caveat there is that we already have some different models as you know, across different markets across the world, given customersâ preferences, our own assets that we've got, and different viewing situations and habits that our customers have. So again, we won't say no to anything in the future, but right now we're really happy with our more highly aggregated model that we have, both from a cost standpoint and from a market opportunity standpoint. But again, who knows it could evolve over time as we learn more and more in different regions across the world.  Doug Mitchelson Alright. Understood. So one question we're increasingly getting from investors is, how much each company needs to invest in content to compete in streaming, and particularly Netflix is as the leader. You've talked about how important content is to driving new subscribers. At the same time, the strength of your brands should give you an advantage. What have you learned after 18 months in the marketplace? Bob Chapek Well, Iâll just start with the strength of our brands and those franchise and those -- the promise with content to come. I mean, we've got built in benefit. Once you have a brand, you have a built-in machine, you have built in momentum because, people like Wanda, they know they're going like Falcon, the Winter Soldier, they like Falcon and the Winter Soldier, they're probably going to like Loki and so on and so forth. And you build up a reputation. But if you really, if you really think about it, in addition to that, I think what we've done is reaffirmed our strategy and our strategy is really based on from a content standpoint that we're going to work globally off those five core brands that really do have broad appeal. We're going to emphasize more than ever our general entertainment content, both in the Star, Star+ and Hulu formats. We're going to really focus in on some local content and really double down there in our international markets. And we've got the machines to do that now. And we're going to focus down on Hotstar, both from an entertainment standpoint and a sports standpoint, given its benefits in those regions. So I think what we've learned is that we're going to continue to do more of what we're doing.  Doug Mitchelson And I had a follow ups sort of on this concept, I think it's really intriguing. I mean, how much engagement do you need on the price you charge and how do you decide what the right amount of content is?  Bob Chapek Right. Well, we spend a tremendous amount of time making sure that engagement is high and that's really what our distribution team is charged with. And part of that is about the value of any one piece of content. And if -- you can look at it two different ways, like there's the incremental marginal benefit of a single piece of content and what that does to the service, but then there's really what it adds to the overall portfolio and incrementally to the overall service. So we really tailor our content in terms of the number of active hours that are needed to maintain healthy engagement. So you look at it individually, but you look at it holistically at the same time, and then we don't just do this so overall for the service, we do it overall for specific engagement groups and customer constituents within the service, so that you're building it by constituent, by type of content, both individually for that piece of content and overall for the overall service. And you try to work up in sort of the best overall scenario, if you will.  Doug Mitchelson One of the things I wanted to clarify is, you said on a couple of different occasions that youâll have new content on Disney+ every week soon. Is that a new TV series or movies starting each week, or is that a new episode of a TV series or movie each week? And I'm curious because you still continue to do an episode at a time versus dropping an entire series at once.  Bob Chapek Our plan is to do -- hit that cadence this year in terms of new product every week. And what we mean by that, as a new movie or series, meaning a new production or library add every week. And that's not counting new episodes, if you will, but does count new seasons. So we count new seasons. We don't count new episodes in that. And something new can be a new movie, a new piece of content or something new added to the library. So that's how we're defining that. And that's the plan right now, but just like everything we've talked about, we're going to evaluate and iterate that going forward, but we've got such a -- again, such a great opportunity to mine our content and create new things and have had such success at it, that our plan is to continue with that one per week defined by the way that we just did. Doug Mitchelson And you've emphasized Disney having a significant amount of relative local content for streaming service overseas. Can you provide more details on that aspect as you sort of emphasized a couple of times that you'd be strong there?  Bob Chapek Yes. We spend a tremendous amount of time now with our regional production teams, which have frankly been recently, if you will, internally grown through the help of our Fox acquisition. And they've been ramping up, they are focusing on general entertainment, obviously. That's relevant to the local region, but there's nothing to say that the content that's created say for Latin America or created for Europe or created for Asia can have legs and really travel sort of elsewhere. In some cases, it's looking at sports and the benefit of adding sports in some markets and as we've done that in places like Latin America, but make no mistake, our foundation, there's always going to be those global franchise-oriented businesses that we've been able to make the foundation of our entire company essentially. Doug Mitchelson Yes. I mean youâre sort of taking me right to my next question, which was news and sports. All others are starting to focus on those genres for their streaming services overseas. Would Disney think to invest more in content for streaming to sort of maintain share of engagement over time or the franchise and the brands you're delivering enough to drive your services already? It's almost as if each company is recreating their own mini payTV bundle and we're always struggling with how many can win in this marketplace.  Bob Chapek Well, we're going to look at those opportunities selectively. You look at our Star+ business, which we're locating -- or launching, sorry, in Latin America on 8/31 and thatâs general entertainment and sports. So in that case, yes. And then you look at how deep are we going, when we go into it, we're going big. For example, in Argentina, we're going to have 10,000 live sporting events per year in Argentina. So if we're going to do something, we're going to do it right, we're going to do it big. But it really is a market-by-market evaluation. And that's one of the ways that we're approaching this DTC business, is not to assume that every market is the same, we're going to have more global approach. We're going to customize what we do by market. And if it gives us a slightly different way to go to market or look at what assets we need to get, then so be it. But we're going to do what's right for each market and so it depends.  Doug Mitchelson So continuing on sports, ESPN, a plenty of areas I would say have greatest uncertainty for those not investing in Disney and frankly I understand that you have little incentive, just got -- taking the main ESPN network to a la carte streaming until you complete it, at least canât get additionals and finish up a full cycle since the company just started shifting direct-to-consumer. So I thought we tried it this way. What would you say to those skeptics that ESPN -- regarding the health of ESPN call it sort of 5 years from now? Bob Chapek Well, we're committed to sports because we value live sports, which drives viewers and interest like nothing else. We all know what the statistics say about who turns into what in live sports always leads the way. So sports are important in terms of being able to bring in the viewers. We know ESPN is at the top of their game and the leader in live sports and ESPN can do it across the linear methods of distribution, the digital methods of distribution and the DTC platforms. And that linear also happens to benefit, have the benefit of providing a tremendous amount of cash flow, which is really funding the operation not only in a post COVID standpoint where we're trying to recover from that, but also given the extraordinary investment that we need to make in direct-to-consumer. So it's really providing a very strategic purpose for the organization right now.  That said, that over time, if that were to change or our reliance on that business would become lessened, then we would reevaluate our options. We always say we're going to be in a business that increases our shareholder value and sports is no different. So we'll reevaluate that over time. But right now, it's operating very well for us and doing something that we really need, which is generating a lot of cash for us.  Doug Mitchelson So I imagine, you're not going to want to put a timeframe on as to when ESPN network will shift to a la carte, though we certainly welcome that today if you wanted to. But is there any visibility you can offer for investors in the plan or like a period of time where you know it's highly unlikely and then wouldn't next time? So I mean the math seems challenging next few years, when I think about it in terms of downside risk to linear revenue versus streaming upside, is it fair to say that ESPN a la carte is unlikely in the next two to three years?  Bob Chapek Well, I'm not going to comment on specifically when we believe that timing is going to be, but I would point to the fact that we bought flexibility into every new media rights deal that we've done in terms of sports rights. And I think you recognize that. So the speed of the transition will be dependent on the speed of the evolution of the consumer behavior. Ultimately, we will be guided by our returns to shareholders. And so we believe that's best served by keeping our eye on what the consumer wants. And when full content migration to such a platform makes sense, we'll be prepared to do that. We don't believe that time is right now, but when it is time, we'll be prepared to do that.  Doug Mitchelson So looking then across the linear networks in general, I'll be upfront though -- and what was the sales strategy, volume versus price? We did have Jeff from NBCUniversal earlier saying, the upfront is done for them. Fox said, well, almost done. Where is Disney at?  Bob Chapek Well, this is our first year of consolidated sales across our entire enterprise into one ad sales group. And so for us, the results were really, really encouraging across our portfolio I should say. We had price increases versus '19, which is again, probably the best base year to evaluate it against, that were all significant. And our total upfront revenue was up by double-digits. And I think that sets sort of a nice headline if you will. But 40% of our sales this year were actually in streaming and digital, which I think speaks to the nature of how this business is rapidly changing, and obviously we're well positioned to do that as the business continues to evolve. So we're really happy with the upfront, our sales team did an extraordinary job.  Doug Mitchelson So letâs add all up on sort of the network side of the house. Liner Network business was an awfully good one for Disney in the past two decades. Will the traditional streaming allow Disney to sustain or grow its historical profitability in media? Make it up for linearâs inevitable decline? Was that unrealistic given the cost to company being a streaming retailer? And how competitive that will be relative to competing within, that was a pretty cozy payTV bundle for a long time.  Bob Chapek Yes. Well, we believe -- so we believe that -- we started this early enough, while the sort of the legacy business is still strong enough that those lines when added together will continue to grow into the future and we'll have a strong growth engine in media going forward.  Now, as I mentioned many times that linear business does offer us an attractive cash flow and funds that content generation across our ecosystem, as we make that accelerated pivot to DTC and the -- if you will, the hunger for new content that such a new platform sort of requires. But we've only just really begun that, that content roll out internationally. And I think, as we grow, we develop and control those DTC relationships, capturing a higher percentage of the economics as well. Let's never forget about the difference in the key play on some of these different platforms. All platforms are not created equal if you will. And so that gives us the opportunity to take one business and trade it for another that might actually, as we go direct-to-consumer, give us the higher capture rate if you will.  So we're just in the beginning of this journey but we're really optimistic that the media business is going to be a growth engine for us, for the -- not only the midterm but the long-term as well.  Doug Mitchelson So, obviously weâve been in discussion today across all of your businesses. I wanted to leave with sort of a final question. Will the Board restore the dividend, and what will guide that decision, Bob? Bob Chapek Yes. That is a board decision. And as you know, they meet a couple of times a year just to discuss this issue and they'll take into account what theyâve taken into account in the past, which is, what's our strategic investment outlook, where our alternative uses of capital and what are those priorities? What our financial leverage look like coming out of COVID? What the operating environment look like in terms of the release of restrictions that we've got that might constrain our business going forward, or at least give us some time to actually ramp back up to full operating mode, if you will? And what's really just the overall recovery of our businesses across the entire enterprise?  Our first priority, though, I can pretty much guarantee you, will be funding our DTC growth. That's going to be our first priority. Then after that, we'll look beyond that and see what our next priority is going to be in terms of that dividend. I should say that our dividends will be a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy, for sure, but that's once we have a normalized operating environment, and I guess it's in the eye of the beholder as to what's a normalized operating environment, given that we're just now in the next week, coming online with our final theme park, reopening in Paris and our cruise lines still not yet operating.  Doug Mitchelson Thatâs right. So with that, nailed it on time. It's a great way to end and Bob thanks so much for the thoughts today. Thank you for all your time. Thank you for everyone listening in. And as we noted earlier, look forward to having these meetings in person rather than virtual. Thank you so much.  Bob Chapek Thanks. I appreciate it.",2021-06-15

Frank Sleep apnea is common in the U.S. affecting approximately 22 million adults and children.  Sufferers have enough to worry about from this sometimes life-threatening condition.  Now devices used to treat it as well as COVID patients are being recalled for causing heath issues that can also be life-threatening. From the New York Post:  Philips sleep apnea devices recalled over potential cancer risks  Philips is recalling millions of devices — including sleep apnea machines and ventilators used for coronavirus patients — over concerns that a component could cause cancer and respiratory problems, the company said Monday. A foam piece used in millions of Philips “DreamStation” PAP, CPAP and ventilator devices can degrade and release potentially toxic fumes into patients, the Dutch medical firm said in a release. Exposed people could be at increased risk of cancer, respiratory issues, inflammation, nausea and vomiting among other effects, according to the company.      Between 3 and 4 million devices are being affected by the recall, Reuters reported, citing Philips chief executive Frans van Houten. About 80 percent of the devices being recalled are used for treating sleep apnea, while the remaining 20 percent are ventilators, the outlet reported. Of the devices being recalled, several ventilators are used for treating coronavirus patients, according to the company’s site. The recall is expected to cost Philips a whopping 500 million Euros, or about $606 million, according to the company. About 80 percent of the devices being recalled are used for treating sleep apnea, while the remaining 20 percent are ventilators, Philips’ CEO said according to Reuters. In a message to patients, Philips warned that patients using ventilators should not automatically stop using them because the potential lifesaving benefits may outweigh the potential risks of toxic foam. The company is working on a program to replace the foam piece that must be approved by regulators, Philips added. “In consultation with the relevant regulatory agencies and in close collaboration with our customers and partners, we are working hard towards a resolution, which includes the deployment of the updated instructions for use and a comprehensive repair and replacement program for the affected devices,” said van Houten. “We deeply regret any concern and inconvenience that patients using the affected devices will experience.”           Philips spokesperson Kathy O’Reilly did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

ASUS added six new RTX 30 series graphics cards, and these cards follow NVIDIA's guidelines for its LHR variants ASUS has followed NVIDI's guidelines as perfectly as possible, as they have not only added the LHR tag to the product page, but they also added it to the packaging.

The New York-based bank said that it has many plans on $ETH, and it is expected that they would happen in the next few months. The firm's head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott confirmed this. Goldman is Pursuing Ethereum in WallStreet  (Photo :  Executium from Unsplash)Goldman Sachs is moving to Ethereum trading  According to the latest report by Bloomberg, Goldman has been known to be reliant on the capability of Bitcoin in public trading. This year, the bank has initiated a restart in its trading desks for its traders and clients. According to McDermott, the group would carry over the trading through the ""exchange-traded notes"" which will keep an eye on Bitcoin. As far as we know, the flow of cryptocurrency in the market is volatile, and it has an impact on our money. Previously, the regulators warned the public about the risks in trading such as money laundering. Moreover, more banks have been granting a special Bitcoin service to big-time customers. The warnings, however, are not enough to stop people from trading despite the plunge in the prices last month. At that time, $BTC's value had decreased to $33,000 from $60,000 in a few days. This made hedge fund managers more excited about engaging Bitcoin trades. ""We've actually seen a lot of interest from clients who are eager to trade as they find these levels as a slightly more palatable entry point. We see it as a cleansing exercise to reduce some of the leverage and the excess in the system, especially from a retail perspective,"" McDermott said via phone interview on Thursday, June 10. Since last year, the 47-year-old McDermott has been assigned to the position to supervise Goldman's progress. The once four-man team had expanded to 17 members since then.

Last May, the bank also invested $15 million in Coin Metrics which just recently joined the board of the company. McDermott said that the organization is eyeing the participation of various firms which would be strategically aligned with their goals. Besides Goldman, other banks already initiated giving crypto services. The latest includes Cowen Ic which eyes ""institutional-grade"" custody services for crypto investment. Moreover, Standard Chartered Pic is also offering digital currencies like Ethereum in the market. Meanwhile, HSBC Holdings Pic is on the same crypto track, too, but it is preventing a close deal with Bitcoin at the moment. Last week in a survey involving 850 institutions, Goldman discovered that only one out of 10 are investing in crypto trading while only 20% showed interest in diving into it. McDermott said that people's interest plays an important role in crypto trading despite the material price correction. Nonetheless, institutional adoption will persist. On Monday, June 14, Goldman Sachs detailed its risk-adjusted returns for the semi-annual updates for the Sharpe ratio basket, CNBC reported.

Ch… [+3599 chars]",Yahoo Entertainment,"Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain may have dropped, but that has not stopped an increasing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) users and developers from flocking to layer 2 solution Polygon.Cheap transaction costs and fast block times have largely driven the growing adoption of Polygon by SushiSwap, Aave and other DeFi projects, according to analysts and people behind some DeFi projects.Polygon, one of the early projects providing an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, has grown significantly in the past few months. For example, as of June 13, popular automated market maker SushiSwap has more than 15,000 unique active wallets on Polygon, while on Ethereum that number was around 4,194, according to data provided by crypto data site DappRadar – meaning there are more SushiSwap users on Polygon than there are on Ethereum.Related: Crypto Derivatives Platform dYdX Raises $65M in Paradigm-Led Series CA June 10 report by DappRadar also highlighted that in May alone DeFi money market Aave logged a daily average of $6.75 billion in transaction volume on Polygon compared to $2.48 billion and $2.28 billion for Aave and Aave version 2, respectively, on Ethereum.Aave has been working with Polygon since March, as CoinDesk reported, in order to “escape” the high transaction fees on Ethereum.“Using layer 2 solutions especially Polygon makes more sense because when we talk about DeFi, if the transaction cost is very high, it doesn’t make sense for small players or for the normal traders to use the application,” Sameep Singhania, co-founder of Polygon-based decentralized exchange QuickSwap, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk. “That’s why I think it’s a good move that DeFi is moving to Polygon.”Polygon’s MATIC tokenPrices for Polygon’s MATIC token also have rallied significantly this year so far, according to Messari. Now ranked 15th by market capitalization, MATIC token’s price is up nearly 9,000% on a year-to-date basis.Story continuesRelated: Umee Raises $6.3M to Connect Cosmos and Ethereum With Cross-Chain DeFi“Layer 2 solutions are a catalyst for growth and new users” for DeFi, Mira Christanto, an analyst at Messari, wrote in an email response to CoinDesk. “Ethereum gas fees have been prohibitive for many users. Polygon and other layer 2 solutions are a precursor of demand on Ethereum when the gas fee hurdle is removed.”Most recently, Polygon’s rise also occurred as Ethereum’s gas fee, the cost for the amount of computational effort required to execute trades on Ethereum, has dropped significantly. But analysts said that it may indicate a promising future for Ethereum 2.0, a system-wide upgrade for Ethereum blockchain that aims to improve the blockchain’s usability and scalability.“Until ETH 2.0 is fully rolled out, layer 2 solutions are needed to create scalability on the Ethereum blockchain,” Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain, said in an email response. “If a product creates an easy-to-use solution, the market will stick to it like glue.”SushiSwap tractionNotably, the trading volume of SushiSwap on Ethereum is still much higher than it is on Polygon, per data on DappRadar. On June 14 alone, SushiSwap notched around $200 million in transaction volume on Ethereum but only about $47 million in transaction volume on Polygon over the same time period.This may indicate that Polygon’s growth is mainly due to increased DeFi usage by retail traders and investors, who are mostly conducting small value transactions.“It shows that whales still want to pay gas fees and use Ethereum DEXs [decentralized exchanges],” Ian Kane, senior content specialist at DappRadar, said. “But the new wave of lower value investors are not so diehard for Ethereum and are just looking for good user experiences and low fees.”Related StoriesSwitzerland’s Sygnum Bank Gets Into DeFiHuman Protocol Expands hCaptcha Tool, Launches Wallet to Make AI Smarter",2021-06-15

The U.S. currency has been buoyed as traders closed short positions before the Fed's two-day policy-setting confab, which kicks off on Tuesday. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was flat early in Asia at 90.517. It has pushed briefly above 90.60 in each of the last two sessions, and 90.63 would be the strongest level since May 14. Traders will be watching carefully for clues on when policymakers will start tapering dollar-depreciating stimulus. So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have stressed that rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time to come, although recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure after the post-COVID-19 economic reopening could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal. ""While Powell will tread carefully, I expect that the Fed is warming to a more open discussion about tapering, to be formally announced in the September meeting,"" Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne, wrote in a note to clients. ""Any view that cements a formal announcement in September should be modestly USD bullish, but the risks are symmetrical as Powell will be keen to not hurt financial conditions,"" he wrote. Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter, despite a patchy recovery in the job market.  read more  Currency markets settled in tight ranges with implied volatility plumbing multi-month lows after last week's strong inflation readings and a dovish European Central Bank meeting failed to dislodge currencies from recent trading levels.

The euro  was little changed at $1.21185 on Tuesday, near an almost one-month low at $1.20930 reached on Friday.

Last week, bitcoin hit a low of just above $31,000, its lowest level since January, but in the last 24 hours it broke through $40,000, a noted resistance level among traders. The upward trend started in the middle of last week, but breaking $40,000 came on the same day that software company MicroStrategy Inc. announced that it has raised $500 million from a bond sale to purchase bitcoin. The Nasdaq-listed company, which dates back to 1989, offers business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services, but it has made regular headlines as a large investor in bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which claims that “we are still early on bitcoin,” currently holds 92,079 bitcoin, worth more than $1.6 billion at the current price. According to The Block, using the money raised in the bond sale the company can now buy about 12,000 additional bitcoin, taking its holdings to more than 100,000. Although significant investments in bitcoin can sometimes be controversial, MicroStrategy is said to have received more than $1.5 billion in orders for the offering. Investors also like what they saw, with the company’s share price closing up almost 16% in regular trading today, to $598.49. More positive news came from Central America where El Salvador announced that it is adopting bitcoin as legal tender last week. The country also called for the use of geothermal energy for bitcoin mining in the country. Returning to form, SpaceX Inc. and Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk once again may have played a role. Responding to allegations from Magda Wierzycka, CEO of financial services company Sygnia Ltd. that his previous tweets about bitcoin were intentional price manipulation, Musk indicated that Tesla may accept bitcoin as a payment option again in the future. Notably, the price of bitcoin dropped in May after Musk announced Tesla would drop the option, citing environmental concerns. “This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market,” Musk wrote. “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions.” Bitcoin was trading at $40,390 as of about 9 p.m. EDT, up more than 3% over the last 24 hours.

Just this week, Worldline announced a partnership with Microsoft to enable companies with digital-first business models to mitigate fraud risks by integrating Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection into Worldline’s digital payments solution for eCommerce firms. Citing the $12 billion in estimated global fraud losses, Worldline’s announcement coincided with revelations about the latest ransomware payments and risks emerging. And while consumer payments can be susceptible to fraud, many firms are grappling with the consequences of B2B payments fraud too as they navigate other threats. This week’s B2B Data Digest digs into the latest numbers behind B2B payment fraud, ransomware and other cyber threats targeting companies of all sizes. $48,000 was stolen from a small business in Greece that fell victim to a business email compromise (BEC) scam, local reports in Cyprus Mail revealed. The cybercriminal posed as a legitimate supplier requesting immediate payment on an order that the business had actually made — suggesting the attacker had infiltrated the company’s email accounts. After the payment was made, the business informed the real supplier, which confirmed that it had not actually received any money. Local law enforcement is reportedly investigating the matter. $700,000 was allegedly embezzled by a bookkeeper of a Missouri farm and trucking company, CCJ Digital reports revealed. The fleet employee pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud, one count of bank fraud, and one count of money laundering. Reports said the fraud involved the individual stealing company commercial cards for personal expenses and then fraudulently obtaining new commercial cards. Other aspects of the scheme included forging signatures on checks, reports added. $800,000 worth of payroll payments were diverted to fraudsters’ debit cards, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has just made another arrest as part of the case. Reports in Nairametrics said the FBI discovered an individual was allegedly controlling prepaid debit cards used to steal payroll funds by infiltrating a payroll processing company’s systems and redirecting payouts. In a statement, FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said, “ Cyber intrusions ripple through everything our society relies upon  — this one impacted people’s paycheck.” $2 million worth of a business loan was reportedly fraudulently obtained by a Hollywood CEO, reports in Daily News said. The CEO, which headed two production companies, has agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud related to reportedly fabricating corporate finance documents in order to obtain the loan. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said the individual faces up to 20 years in prison. Part of the fraud involved fabricating accounts receivable documents, with the individual claiming that his companies were owed more than $3.3 million in receivables; he also allegedly falsified a document used to claim a $100,000 wire payment to the lender was on its way. $7.5 million worth of fraudulent B2B transactions were detected by Indian law enforcement, reports recently revealed. The Directorate General of GST Intelligence reportedly arrested a supplier of an unnamed iron and steel manufacturer. Law enforcement claims that the supplier facilitated the creation of fake invoices and sent it to the manufacturer, which did not actually receive any goods, in an effort to claim fraudulent Input Tax Credit. The investigation is ongoing, reports noted. $11 million was paid by meat supplier JBS to ransomware attackers, the company revealed, mere days after the U.S. government recovered more than half of the $4.4 million paid to ransomware attackers by Colonial Pipeline. The high-value payments continue to raise alarms among cybersecurity experts as well as U.S. law enforcement, which are urging businesses not to pay ransomware payments. According to reports in the Wall Street Journal, JBS USA Holdings, a division of Brazil-based JBS,  paid the ransomware in bitcoin in an effort to regain control of its systems and avoid further disruption.

We experienced record-setting sub-freezing temperatures in our Texas market that brought our business to a halt for half the month of February, the same cold weather front also affected construction activities in our central region especially when compared to unseasonably favorable weather conditions experienced in the prior year.  However, as a testament to our resilient business model, we delivered second quarter that returned solid consolidated revenue growth, strong margins and free cash flow performance that was in line with our internal expectations. This included continued growth in our market share, strength in our residential and infrastructure projects and the continued recovery in our commercial work.  We continued to demonstrate our strong financial profile with $28.5 million in year-to-date free cash flow that contributed to our improving total available liquidity of $134.9 million. Given our execution to date, we remained in a strong position to execute upon our strategic priorities and financial outlook in 2021.  To provide a bit more detail about our Q2 results, total consolidated revenue improved by 4% compared to a year ago. Our second quarter last year was partially impacted by COVID-19, as the pandemic really started to set in during the month of April. Our ability to return to revenue and margin growth is a testament to our scale, diversified regional end-market exposure and our highly variable cost structure.  Now to review our individual reporting segments. In our U.S. pumping business, revenue was down slightly due to the historic winter storm in February impacting our Texas and central regions and continued COVID-19 headwinds in some of our commercial projects. This volume headwind was mostly offset by continued strength in market share expansion in our other regions across the residential and infrastructure sectors.  In our UK segment, revenue was up 41% due to a strong recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 as our UK operations were hit harder by the pandemic earlier and for a more prolonged period than our U.S. business.  In Eco-Pan, revenue increased almost 9% due to continued organic growth, pricing improvements and growth in our roll-off service adoption. Eco-Pan revenue growth was slightly muted when compared to the pre-pandemic times due to our teamâs difficulty to thrive in a virtual sales environment. However, with our customers gaining more and more comfortable in a virtual selling model, and with the gradual reopening of the economy, we are optimistic about returning to our double-digit sales growth rate soon.  In fact, we continue to make additions in our Eco-Pan sales force during the quarter to strengthen our longer term growth strategy. Now turning to some end-market commentary, in the residential market, demand remains especially strong for single-family homes and we have been able to capitalize on that momentum.  As discussed on our prior call, residential construction has been a bright spot for our company and we expect it to represent roughly a third of our total sales this fiscal year, compared to the 30% in fiscal 2020. While the pandemic has caused some weakness in the commercial construction markets, we have intentionally shifted our focus and tailored our fleet management to capture residential opportunities and have picked up several new customers as a result.  From a commodities and supply chain perspective, the recent lumber shortages and other impact cost increase in the industry have not affected demand for our services and we expect the residential markets to remain strong over the near-term. Staying on commodities for a moment, there is some headwinds on cement availability in our U.S. business.  Several cement plants have undergone critical maintenance, which has introduced some regional tightness in the cement material supply. While this is expected to be short-term issue, there is yet another example of our fleet â the value of our fleet management agility scale and diversity. While we do not purchase transport or own this commodity, wherever possible, we are utilizing our breadth of relationships to help mitigate any project delays our customers may face.  We are also seeing continued success with our infrastructure projects in the U.S. and the UK. The UK market has always been infrastructure project heavy including the concrete-intensive high speed railway project that will last beyond 2030. In the U.S. we have a steady flow of industrial projects supported by public funding including bridges, schools, wastewater treatment plants and hospitals.  Much talk as of late surrounds around the current administrationâs proposed infrastructure bill. We believe an infrastructure bill will ultimately be passed, although the size, timing and many other details are still unknown. Importantly, our current outlook for fiscal 2021 does not include possible benefits of an infrastructure bill as we believe any resulting construction would not begin until fiscal 2022.  However, many states are beginning to return to fiscal health and we should be able to capitalize on increased infrastructure spending on a state level with or without the passage of an infrastructure bill. As a result, the infrastructure vertical should become a larger percentage of our overall revenue mix over time. Our commercial projects continued to recover along with the nationâs recovery from the pandemic.  This includes continued progress in high growth markets such as fulfillment centers and datacenters for reference, we have completed multiple fulfillment centers that require as much concrete as 25 storey building and are currently working on projects that are as large as a 50 storey building. The typical datacenter requires about 80% of the amount of concrete in a typical fulfillment center.  So we were pleased with our operational execution and financial performance in the second quarter and with the trajectory it puts on us for the remainder of the year. I will return to discuss our long-term growth strategy and provide a market outlook. But for now, Iâll pass the call off to Iain to discuss our second quarter financial results. Iain?  Iain Humphries Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving right into our second quarter 2021 results. Consolidated revenue increased by 4% to $76.9 million compared to $74 million in the same year ago quarter. The revenue increase was mainly driven by organic growth in the UK operations, as the UK construction market continues to emerge from the impacts of Brexit and COVID-related shutdowns.  Additionally, our U.S. concrete waste management business operating under the Eco-Pan brand showed improved momentum and solid organic growth of almost 9% when compared to the same year ago quarter.  Turning now to review our individual segment performance, revenue in our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment mostly operating under the Brundage-Bone brand, was $56.2 million, compared to $57.5 million in the same year ago quarter. The slight decline is attributed to the construction volume impact of the prolonged cold weather front that dominated the Lower 48 in February and in particular, our south and central regions including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado.  For our UK operations, operating largely under the brand - the Camfaud brand, revenue improved 41% to $11.9 million, compared to $8.4 million in the same year ago quarter. This organic growth is largely attributed to the fact that the prior year period was impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns as the UK abruptly locked down at the onset of the pandemic.  We are pleased to report that the UK is now running at over 90% of our pre-COVID-19 revenue runrate and we are optimistic about the rest of the year as the UK region cover â continues to recover rapidly. Revenue in our Concrete Waste Management Services segment increased almost 9% to $9 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $8.3 million in the same year ago quarter.  This increase is due to the solid organic volume growth, pricing improvements, and growth in our roll-off service adoption. As Bruce mentioned, we expect to return to double-digit growth in this segment as the U.S. continues to reopen and our sales teams are able to meet with customers in person.  Returning to our consolidated results, gross profit in the second quarter improved to $33.3 million, compared to $31.9 million in the same year ago quarter, and gross margin improved 30 basis points to 43.3%, compared to 43%. The margin expansion is reflective of the improvement in revenue volumes and the disciplined control over our variable cost.  General and administrative expenses in Q2 were $26.5 million, compared to $26.4 million in the same year ago quarter. The increase in G&amp;A expenses of less than 1% show the revenue increase of 4% due to our teamsâ successful efforts putting cost containment measures in place at the onset of COVID-19.  As a result of a $11.5 million fair value adjustment to warrant liabilities in the second quarter, the net loss available to common shareholders was $11.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $56.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share in the same year ago quarter. Later in our commentary, I will discuss the basis of this fair value warrant liability adjustment.  Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter increased 6.5% to $25 million, compared to $23.5 million in the same year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 32.6%, compared to 31.8% in the same year ago quarter. In our U.S. Concrete Pumping business, adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million, which is consistent in dollar terms with the same year ago quarter and 60 basis points higher in EBITDA margin percentage.  In our UK business, adjusted EBITDA increased 64% to $4.1 million compared to $2.5 million in the same year ago quarter given the sharp recovery in our organic revenue growth. For our U.S. Construction Waste Management business, adjusted EBITDA was $4 million, compared to $4.1 million in the prior year quarter.  As Bruce mentioned, we have made strategic investments in our Eco-Pan sales team ahead of reaccelerating the top-line and on profitability in this segment is reflective of these investments.  Now turning to our capital structure and liquidity, on April 30, 2021, weâve totaled the outstanding of $376.1 million our net debt of $362.4 million, which equates to a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 3.4 times. We have approximately $134.9 million in liquidity as of April 30, 2021, which includes cash on the balance sheet and availability from our ABL facility.  This is an improvement of 14%, compared to January 31, 2021 and greatly enhances our balance sheet capacity and ability to pursue accretive investment opportunities like M&amp;A, as well as support our overall long-term growth strategy.  As a reminder, following our strategic refinance activities in January of this year, and a high cash generation business model, we have successfully lowered our income â interest expense by $5.3 million and our cash interest paid expense by $10.8 million year-to-date. We have no near-term debt maturities with our senior notes and asset-based lending facility maturing in 2026.  Our business continues to generate healthy operating free cash flows. We invoice our customers daily for the work we perform and we have minimal working capital requirements since we do not take ownership of the concrete we place. As an example of our healthy cash flow model, we have generated approximately $28.5 million in free cash flow year-to-date in fiscal 2021.  This equates to a free cash flow conversion rate from adjusted EBITDA of approximately 60%, which is well above our historical average. Even through the current macroeconomic environment, our ability to generate this strong free cash flow allows us to expand our liquidity position and delever in line with our strategic goals.  In what was a relatively shape for our quarter operationally, the SEC came out with a statement on April 12, which introduced new interpretations of the accounting guidance for warrant structures that are common and special purpose acquisition corporations. The SECâs perspective is that more spec warrants should be presented as liabilities on the balance sheet and mark-to-market each period.  So we have restated our prior audited financial statements in order to conform retroactively with the SEC statement. The 8-K and 10-K/A filings registered on Friday and our 10-Q filed today provide the detail on this non-cash mark-to-market impact on net income, which is valued using quoted market prices of public warrants and are primarily a function of our stock price movements.  It falls below operating income and has nothing to do with the actual performance of our business operations. This change does not impact any of our key operating metrics or any of our GAAP metrics of our operating income or any of our non-GAAP metrics. Also there is no impact on capital structures in any way such as our net debt or leverage, the covenants in our debt facilities or our economic share trend.  I believe the point here is that this change does not alter the way that we think about our business in any way and we continue to be as transparent as possible about how the business is performing. As a reminder, all of our outstanding public warrants expire in December of 2023.  Turning now to provide an update on CapEx investments, we have been consistently making improvements to our existing Concrete Pumping fleet age. This is critically important for several reasons. First, by improving the age of our fleet, we inherently enhance the safety and reliability of our equipment. We lower our repair costs and reduce repair time, which helps stimulate opportunities to capture project wins with new customers. Also, an enhanced fleet helps attract qualified employees and often improves employee retention.  Our consistent investments in our fleet of equipment also underscores the strength and confidence we have in our business outlook. The combination of improved repair cost and improved equipment capacity ensure that our fleet uptime is optimized during our busiest periods. These are critical factors in driving improved margin performance across the business.  As 2021 progresses, we will continue to apply prudent capital allocation and remain opportunistic with strategic and accretive CapEx investments. Our fiscal year 2021 financial outlook remains unchanged, and our second quarter results were in line with our internal expectations as our U.S. and U.K. markets continue to recover from the Q2 weather and COVID-19 disruptions. As a reminder of our previously released 2021 guidance, we expect our full year revenues to range between $300 million and $310 million, adjusted EBITDA to range between $105 million and $110 million and free cash flow, which we define as adjusted EBITDA, less net CapEx and less cash interest to range between $47.5 million to $52.5 million.  Operationally and financially, we remain strong, and we are actively working to execute on our growth strategy. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Bruce. Bruce Young Thanks, Iain. In the second quarter of 2021, we were pleased with our organic growth and the trajectory of our business. We are gradually returning to a normalized state in both the U.S. and UK and we look forward to driving scale through continued organic growth as well as strategic M&amp;A. Regarding our organic growth strategy, we have exciting news to share as we enhance our U.S. national sales strategy to capture additional growth opportunities.  In our Eco-Pan business, we continue to build our U.S. sales team and strategic locations to enhance the reach of our service and communicate to disruptive economic value of our service offering to new customers. In our U.S. Pumping business, we are delighted to announce that we have recently hired Tom O'Malley as our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.  Tom joins our executive team after 25 years as a Senior Executive with Schwing America, who is a leading global supplier of concrete pumping equipment. We are very pleased to welcome Tom to our team and his first-class industry expertise will be valuable in driving the continued development in our U.S. national sales strategy.  Now turning to our acquisition strategy that Iâve shared in prior earnings calls, we have a clear criteria for how we approach potential acquisitions. We continue to balance our disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and financial flexibility.  Our priorities remain focused on value enhancement acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and a consistent return of value to our shareholders. We continue to prioritize high returning capital investments that enable revenue growth and improving operational efficiencies to drive margin expansion.  The acquisition deals that we are looking at is a robust pipeline and our team has consistently had a very disciplined approach to M&amp;A and that is what you will see us continue to do. We are very clear in these areas we want to grow and we will continue to develop our market-leading share position as this ultimately what is important to accretive value creation.  Looking forward to the rest of the year, in the U.S. residential construction continues to be an area of momentum and strength for our business and we expect continued demand for these projects for the rest of the year. In our infrastructure projects, we also expect continued momentum, especially in areas like the UK. In commercial, we are seeing the continuation of increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and datacenters as ecommerce accelerates and people remain working from homes.  We expect this investment to aid the recovery of our commercial business in the second half of this fiscal year. In Eco-Pan, we will focus on driving growth despite pandemic-related challenges and greatly look forward to accelerate the momentum as the year progresses.  With that, Iâd now like to turn the call back over to Paul for Q&amp;A.  Question-And-Answer Session  Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.  Andy Wittmann Hey guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Iain, I was just hoping that you could help us get our arms around the magnitude of the weather in the quarter.  Can you talk about what those two weeks in those market costs maybe in terms of revenue that got pushed out of the quarter presumably into another quarter or not canceled but can you also just talk about the mechanism, is it all just delayed? Do you work extra hard and kind of make it up here in the current quarter and then kind of back on track or just some of that work just kind of nominal out of this fiscal year and then into next fiscal year? Just want to see if we can understand that mechanism better.  Iain Humphries  Yes, Andy. We did actually catch up from where we were back in February and the resulting impact on the second quarter was right around the $1 million revenue mark that you seen as being slightly behind in the second quarter.  And in terms of how that might play over the rest of the year, we expect that weâll recover that in subsequent quarters. So that the 2% impact is not something that we expect will not be able to catch up on, and our customers have actually done quite a good job recovering from that quite severe weather in February where some locations were closed for about half of the month.  Andy Wittmann Got it. Okay. So, itâs $1 million bucks in the U.S. segment, 2%, so, you guys kind of think of the quarter as kind of flat ex weather, I guess that makes sense. And then, Bruce, just on the impact of the cement plants being closed and the tightness in the cement markets. I was hoping if you could just put a little bit more meat on that bone as well, in particular, I guess, how widespread are these issues? It sounds like there are pockets that maybe not everywhere.  Could you talk about if the tightness is getting worse or itâs getting better here even subsequent to the quarter just so we can understand what the impact is to your business. Is this a new factor? Do you guys feel like you are going to be able to work through this and supplement with other work thatâs going to make â get you back to the original guidance or do you feel like this is not your fault, but like this is a negative to your ability to drive to the revenue guidance that you put out?  Bruce Young Yes, certainly, itâs a little bit of a headwind but we are comfortable that we can work through it to meet our original guidance. Thatâs where we reaffirm that. Itâs more regional and it can be at any point in time during the week or they just run out of cement. We may be delayed some of those â some markets are shutting down on half a day on Friday that sort of thing. But itâs havenât been a significant impact to us yet. We donât think it will be during the summer, but we are certainly watching that and making sure that we bring the assets in the areas that arenât as affected.  Andy Wittmann Got it. I guess, maybe just my last question here. So, what are you seeing on the infrastructure side of the business in the U.S.? Certainly, itâs strong in the UK [Indiscernible] for some time. Even itâs â we are certainly getting to a more of the construction season the way I think about it for that stuff. Is work going to break this year on healthy state projects and potential any stimulus or do you think thatâs really sounds like more of a 2022 phenomenon. But just wondering if states are kind of going after â state and local governments are getting back out there and letting awards, so that these things in your belt and just kind of curious on the pace of that?  Bruce Young Sure, we are seeing some improvements at the state level with projects that were put on hold that are now started and new projects are being planned that will help us towards the end of this year and into next year. But it is â there is reason to be a little bit more optimistic about that.  Andy Wittmann Got it. Thanks guys. Iâll leave with there.  Bruce Young Thanks, Andy.  Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Kusswurm with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.  Sam Kusswurm  Hey guys. Hope you all are doing well. On the labor side of things here, setting aside wage inflation for a second, I want to focus more on labor availability. Has it been more difficult lately to find and retain skilled workers and has employee retention rates of frontline workers changed at all in recent months?  Bruce Young Thatâs great question. I think the biggest challenge our industry faces, not just us, but the entire construction industry is labor. Weâve done a pretty good job of retaining the employees that we have but bringing new employees in has been a little more challenging for us.  We are hoping that as some of the stimulus packages and folks are needing to get back to providing for their families that that will open up a little bit more for us. But weâve been able to balance it to this point. Itâs not getting worse and hopefully it will continue to get better.  Sam Kusswurm Great, great. Maybe switching [Indiscernible] M&amp;A here. In your last earnings call and today, you mentioned having several NDAs with powerful acquisition targets. I was hoping just to get an update on your M&amp;A pipeline here. Are there still acquisition targets out there for you guys? If so, what are the primary hurdles that you face in terms of closing an acquisition?  Bruce Young Yes. I donât know that there is any primary hurdles. Itâs just a matter of getting the right acquisition and thatâs right a fit for us. We have several active conversations going on and we are hoping that weâll be able to act on some of those at some time in the future.  Sam Kusswurm Cool. Well, I appreciate the commentary.  Bruce Young Alright. Thanks, Sam.  Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.  Brent Thielman  Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, Bruce, Iain. So a question on Eco-Pan and maybe just an update on the sales force growth initiatives. Where do you feel like you are with that? And is your expectation right now that that still might cause a little bit of margin headwind here over the next couple of quarters? And maybe just a follow-up to that, how do you think about kind of returning to that double-digit growth pace that youâve seen in that business over the course of this year?  Bruce Young Yes. Brent, thanks for asking that question. So, as you know, with concrete pumping, most contractors know that if they canât drive a ready mix truck to the plant placement, the concrete pump is the best most efficient safest way to place the concrete. With Eco-Pan, itâs taking people from using some kind of a legacy system that they used to using our system and have been and show them how itâs more environmentally compliant and cost effective at the same time.  So, thatâs something thatâs more difficult to do in a virtual environment. Weâve done a good job of gaining some share and growing the business but not at the rate that we had in the past now as offices are getting back to work and they have the ability to meet with folks we expect that to accelerate and we expect to move back to double-digit growth by the end of the year.  Brent Thielman  Okay. Thatâs great. And then, can you guys comment on utilization levels in the pumping business, I guess, between the U.S. and UK? And whether itâs an average for the quarter or where youâd [Indiscernible] the quarter? Just curious where â what the differences are between the two regions?  Iain Humphries Yes. I mean, the differences between the regions is largely on the availability. We look at the utilization by job in the UK and we look at the utilization by hours in the U.S. because typically we get multiple jobs in the U.S. as opposed to the UK. In terms of percentages, they are actually quite comparable.  And consistently around the second quarter of our business and we usually see utilization rates in the high 70s and thatâs where we are today. So, thatâs quite comparable with last year. The utilization trends that we see in our business are where we would expect them to be for the second quarter.  Brent Thielman  Okay. And then, you all had that price adjustments go into effect in January. I guess, I am just wondering as inflation get to little more of a base as labor is always been challenging, but I mean, any anticipation that additional sort of price adjustments needed at this stage in the fiscal year?  Iain Humphries We are falling naturally closely. The two things that we are most concerned about with the labor inflation and petroleum products, fuel that sort of thing. Right now, weâve been able to keep those fairly consistent with where our expectations are, but weâll continue to watch that and adjust as necessary.  Brent Thielman  Okay. Thank you guys.  Iain Humphries Thanks, Brent.  Operator [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.  Steven Fisher  Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Just, in terms of seasonality, your guidance implies around 55% of EBITDA in the second half. I might have thought the second half would be a higher percentage of that given just kind of weather patterns affecting your business and the first half issues of COVID and the severe weather. So I am wondering, if maybe or second half guidance implied has some conservatism in there at the moment.  Iain Humphries Yes. Hi, Steve. And so, weâve said before, I mean, what we typically see from a seasonality perspective is our business for 5 - 55% and across our business. So â and thatâs why we have reaffirmed guidance. And we are right around that range that we would expect to be performing at. And so, the expectation for the second half is around that 55% mark as you mentioned. So we are right on pace and weâre delivering that in the second half of the year.  Steven Fisher  Okay. And in terms of inflation, I guess, how would you anticipate this will affect your CapEx over the next, say, rest of the year or maybe into next year and maybe trying to take the fleet age down, imagine your suppliers are facing some inflationary pressure. So, how is that being passed along back to you? And then, how are you preparing for that or how are they preparing you for that for next year?  Iain Humphries Yes. As we are looking for the CapEx requirements from that shift, I mean, obviously, we are in early discussions of what those pricing measures would look like. We are seeing any meaningful change in pricing at this moment and I mean, largely â I mean, as you know, we are the largest purchaser of this type of equipment in the U.S. and the UK. So, we have some scaled purchasing and we could work with the OEMs. And so we havenât seen any meaningful change in pricing at this moment.  Steven Fisher  Okay. Thank you very much.  Iain Humphries Thanks, Steve.  Operator Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. This does conclude our Question-and-Answer Session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Young for any closing comments.  Bruce Young Thank you, Paul. Weâd like to thank everyone for listening to todayâs call and we look forward to speaking with you when we report our third quarter fiscal 2021 results in September. Thank you.  Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful evening.",2021-06-15

His prediction came out despite the ongoing inconsistencies in the rise and plunge of the cryptocurrencies caused by the environment-damaging application of energy. Tim Draper Makes His Bold Prediction on This Crypto  (Photo :  SimplyBitcoin via screenshot from YouTube)Venture capital investor Tim Draper  According to CNBC's updated report on Monday, June 14, Draper thought that his prediction this time would be correct. Back in 2018, the crypto investor established his price prediction of bitcoin which was stuck at $8,000 as per Coinbase. Now, he was again hellbent to hope that his next forecast would hit the bullseye. Moreover, Draper said that there are only two outcomes that could happen: either he's ""really wrong"" or ""really right"" in his wild guess. This supports his idea that believes in Bitcoin's progress in the upcoming years. The founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) highlighted that after a year and a half, a bitcoin payment processor known as Opennode will allow the engagement of several people. That's the time when many individuals will embrace the use of $BTC. Besides Opennode, other third-party digital wallet apps like Whole Foods, Home Depot, Paypal, Microsoft, and Overstock are the only firms that allow bitcoin payment. For financial analysts, bitcoin could be considered real money in the long run. Apart from that, Draper said that cryptocurrency's usage continues to rise. Despite only 21 million bitcoin existing, many people discovered mining it efficiently.

In the context of the popular meme coin, Dogecoin, Draper stated that this crypto made people smile. Although it looks so fun to look for, there should be some developers to take over its improvement because it looks ""potentially promising."" Tim Draper Says Bitcoin is Undergoing Some Improvements Over the weekend, Interesting Engineering reported that Bitcoin has received a new makeover. Maybe this is one of the criteria that Draper has based on his prediction. The upgrade is said to have updated its efficiency and privacy to develop efforts in terms of the transaction. In the next decades, Draper felt that bitcoin would be the center of finance. He even compared crypto to Microsoft in the field of e-commerce. $BTC is known to have a fluctuation pattern every time Tesla CEO Elon Musk posts a tweet. Last May, the tycoon said that he would suspend bitcoin purchases due to their impact on the environment. Yet, the latest report confirmed that the billionaire would allow it if it covers 50% of clear energy. As of April, bitcoin has reached $64,829 value for its all-time high price. In the following month, it crashed down to $30,000. On Monday, June 14, it hit $40,000 which accounts for an over 7% increase.

Phishing campaigns remained the number one threat to consumer cyber safety, with top scams relating to the pandemic, including vaccine-oriented, financial relief, and tech support scams.  “Our renowned Norton Labs group is at the forefront of identifying and analyzing the latest trends in cybercrime, and it’s clear through their analysis that cybercriminals continue to find new ways to capitalize off of the pandemic,” says Darren Shou, head of technology, NortonLifeLock.  “Over the next three months, we can expect scammers to tap into the gradual shift to a post-COVID state as people start to return to work, travel and engage in social activities.” Between January 2021 and March 2021, 49.6 million phishing attempts, 46.3 million file-based malware, 686,000 mobile-malware files and 536,137 ransomware detections were reported. During this time, the majority of scams were designed to trick consumers into sharing their personal and financial information in an attempt to steal their money. Cryptocurrency popularity driving spikes in illicit coinmining and ransomware Coinmining has come roaring back with the price of Bitcoin quadrupling over the past year. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the price trend and increasingly spreading coinminer malware that exploits consumers’ computer resources (i.e., processor, graphics card, memory and network bandwidth) for illicit mining activities – victims could see a spike in their electric bills as a result.  Similarly, now that consumers have easy access to cryptocurrencies through services like Coinbase, Robinhood and PayPal, there has been a parallel rise in ransomware campaigns requiring payment in cryptocurrency, with a 35% increase from late 2020 to early 2021. Cybercriminals continue targeting gamers In addition to phishing campaigns, “Trojanized” crack campaigns are an increasing threat targeting the gaming community. These cracks are being distributed from sites that show up very early in Google searches and trick gamers into manually disabling antivirus protection while infecting their system with a variety of highly malicious software. Stalkerware on the rise Instances of stalkerware, malware designed to secretly monitor victims’ activities on their devices, increased by 20% from November 2020 to January 2021. A surge in emails purporting to sell stalkerware was also detected.      ",2021-06-15

But the S&P 500 gained 7.71 points, or 0.18 per cent,and the Nasdaq Composite added 104.72 points, or 0.74 per cent to close, both record highs for the indices.The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 1.37 points, or 0.19 per cent.Benchmark 10-year yields rose 4 basis points on Monday to 1.50 per cent, mounting a bit of a comeback after falling to a three-month low of 1.43 per cent on Friday. They have dropped from a one-year high of 1.78 per cent in March.The major market focus is on the upcoming Fed meeting, which will mark the first time the central bank has set policy since a pair of disappointing jobs reports and potential signs of looming inflation. Fed officials have maintained they view recent price increases as ""transitory,"" but the policy update, paired with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's ensuing news conference on Wednesday, will be pored over for signs of when the Fed might begin to pull back unprecedented pandemic stimulus.""While most market participants don't think that the Fed will officially start to taper bond purchases at Wednesday's meeting, there is a greater chance that the growing consensus within the committee is recognising that the economy has indeed made substantial progress and delaying removing some accommodation risks fanning inflation and financial instability,"" said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital.Analysts said the central bank will have to tread a fine line, laying out its strategy for exiting extreme accommodation without spooking investors.Gold prices dipped as investors prepared for a possible Fed exit strategy. Spot gold prices fell $10.6705, or 0.57 per cent,to $1,865.97 an ounce. US gold futures settled 0.7 per cent down at $1,865.9.Oil prices ended mostly unchanged on Monday, after investors drove prices to their highest levels in over two years in anticipation of surging demand. Brent settled up 17 cents at $72.86 a barrel. Earlier in the session, it reached $73.64 a barrel, its highest since April 2019. US West Texas Intermediate fell 3 cents to settle at $70.88 a barrel,after earlier touching $71.78 a barrel, its highest since October 2018.In currencies, the US dollar dipped slightly on Monday after logging its largest weekly change in over a month.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.056 point, or 0.06 per cent.Bitcoin bounced back somewhat after Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker could reopen the door to bitcoin transactions in the future. It traded above $40,000 for the first time in more than two weeks, before paring gains to trade at $39,824.03.

However, they can purchase shares in trusts that do invest in crypto assets from companies such as Grayscale Investments.Related: Fidelity’s Tom Jessop says crypto has hit a ‘tipping point’One firm that does allow the direct purchase of crypto assets and gold for retirement plans is Bitcoin IRA, which was founded in 2016. Commenting on ForUsAll’s collaboration with Coinbase, Chris Kline, co-founder and chief operating officer at Bitcoin IRA, stated:“ForUsAll and Coinbase wouldn’t be doing this if there wasn’t a market. There are people that want this with these types of funds. And they want to have access to new and exciting things with their 401(k)s.”MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor responded to ForUsAll’s move to embrace crypto.If you invest 5% of your portfolio in #bitcoin, you have made the decision to invest 95% of your portfolio in assets getting demonetized by bitcoin.— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) June 14, 2021  In April, Cointelegraph reported that pension funds and insurance firms have been increasingly dedicating part of their asset bases to Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto assets as concerns over inflation escalated amid the coronavirus pandemic. In May 2020, Kingdom Trust, a regulated custodian managing over $13 billion in assets, launched a retirement account supporting both Bitcoin and legacy assets. The firm noted that when the Internal Revenue Service decided to tax Bitcoin, it directly enabled the asset to be held by qualified custodians and in retirement accounts.  ",2021-06-15

The US currency has been buoyed as traders closed short positions before the Fed’s two-day policy-setting confab, which kicks off on Tuesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was flat early in Asia at 90.517. It has pushed briefly above 90.60 in each of the last two sessions, and 90.63 would be the strongest level since May14. Traders will be watching carefully for clues on when policymakers will start tapering dollar-depreciating stimulus. So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have stressed that rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time to come, although recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure post-Covid-19 economic reopening could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal.  Also read: Dollar little changed as traders seek direction from Fed meeting“While Powell will tread carefully, I expect that the Fed is warming to a more open discussion about tapering, to be formally announced in the September meeting,” Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne, wrote in a note to clients. “Any view that cements a formal announcement in September should be modestly USD bullish, but the risks are symmetrical as Powell will be keen to not hurt financial conditions,” he wrote. Nearly 60 per cent of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter, despite a patchy recovery in the job market. Currency markets settled in tight ranges with implied volatility plumbing multi-month lows after last week’s strong inflation readings and a dovish European Central Bank meeting failed to dislodge currencies from recent trading levels. The Deutsche Bank FX Volatility Index plunged to 5.6 on Friday, its lowest in nearly 16 months, and remained just above that level this week. The euro was little changed at $1.21185 on Tuesday, near an almost one-month low at $1.20930 reached on Friday. The yen was at 110.075 per dollar, almost flat from Monday, after a more than 0.3 per cent slide in each of the past two sessions. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded above $41,000 for the first time in more than two weeks on Monday, and was last around $40,495 after rallying from below $35,000 on Sunday after Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmarker would resume allowing bitcoin transactions when miners who verify transactions use more renewable energy.

Following that, Musk said that he will keep paying income tax in California in proportion to his time in the state. Musk also said that he lives in a rented house. He had moved to Texas last year. ""My primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. It's kinda awesome though. Only house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day,"" he had said.

They can’t seem to understand what are the advantages and keep comparing it to the legacy financial system in a way that makes the status quo look good.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609692 = window.pid609692 || rnd;                 var plc609692 = window.plc609692 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609692;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609692 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609692++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc476001 = window.plc476001 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc476001:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_476001_' + plc476001;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 476001,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_476001_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc476001++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609693 = window.pid609693 || rnd;                 var plc609693 = window.plc609693 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609693;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609693 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609693++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                  As an example let’s look into USA Today’s article on Bitcoin Beach: El Zonte’s mini bitcoin economy 26 miles (43 kilometers) from the capital came about through an anonymous donor who started working through a local nonprofit group in 2019. Supporters of the financial change point to it as a demonstration case for how digital currency could help in a country where 70% of the people don’t have bank accounts. President Nayib Bukele, who pushed through the bitcoin law, touts it both as a way to help those many Salvadorans without access to traditional banking services and as a path to attract foreigners with bitcoin holdings to invest in El Salvador, which is the first nation to make the cryptocurrency legal tender. That “path to attract foreigners” seems to be working, if we take Google Searches as a valid indicator. The game is afoot, but it’s just starting, though. We’ll see how this experiment goes.                       if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  BTC price chart on Huobi | Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com Do You Even Know About The Lightning Network? As for the much smaller experiment that’s Bitcoin Beach, USA Today found a way to attack it.  David Gerard, author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,” said El Zonte is an artificial demonstration. At Bitcoin Beach, he said, “the bitcoins are traded inside Strike. They don’t actually move on the bitcoin blockchain or anything.” Gerard said it appears to work because the bitcoin donor keeps pumping bitcoin into the village’s system. “That’s not a proof of concept that works. That shows that you can trade this stuff if you’re not trading actual bitcoins and someone massively subsidizes it.” They not only found the one so-called crypto-journalist that despises Bitcoin, but they printed something like “the bitcoins are traded inside Strike. They don’t actually move on the bitcoin blockchain or anything.” The app uses the Lightning Network to process transactions. That’s Bitcoin’s answer to those that say that it isn’t fast or scalable enough.

Eventually, the system settles those transactions in the first layer, in the blockchain. Does David Gerard not know this? Or is he being dishonest and muddying the waters?

While micro-investing platforms like Sharesies and Hatch allow investors to invest in managed funds, some of them provided by FSC members, they have also made it easy for DIY investors to bypass the local funds industry and invest money into overseas shares from the likes of Tesla and Amazon, as well as overseas managed funds. READ MORE: * Is Hatch or Sharesies better? * Beware the fear of missing out – investing comes in many guises * Sharesies takes on Hatch to win DIY Kiwi investors keen on US shares  But in FSC’sThe Rise of the Digital Investor report, Ryan Bessemer, chief executive officer from Trustees Executors, warned that micro-investing platforms needed regulating to protect the public. “We should apply the same rigour and protection to these emerging products as we do for KiwiSaver and managed funds. There are gaps in our current regulation of micro-investing platforms and these gaps are a risk consumers should be cognisant of,” Bessemer said.Debrin Foxcroft/StuffCarmen Hertzig has taken control of her own investment portfolio with Sharesies. “No one wants to be a handbrake on improving end user experiences, but I do want to make sure there are appropriate warnings and mechanisms in place, so we have safety fences at the top of the mountains rather than the coroners’ vans at the bottom,” he said. Gus Watson, head of investments at Sharesies, which had over 355,000 account-holders, felt the FSC report was “trying to put us in the corner of investing for beginners”. But he said Sharesies’ investors had shown themselves to be good decision-makers, not the unsophisticated investors fund managers sometimes sought to cast them as. And, he said: “Everything that’s on Sharesies is a regulated product, the vast majority are listed products.” Those regulated products included the shares of companies like Tesla, and also managed funds from New Zealand and overseas. Watson said the average “wallet size” of its account holders was $4000, though some people had more than $1 million invested on Sharesies. The average account-holder had money invested in four companies and three managed funds through the platform, he said. They were long-term investors, rather than traders. The FSC report, which is based on a survey of just over 2000 people, also corralled online cryptocurrency speculation platforms alongside of the likes of Sharesies and Hatch. “Investing in New Zealand shares, international shares and cryptocurrency is rising in popularity, with a 6 to 7 per cent increase in reported use since March 2020,” the report said. Just under one in 10 people who answered the survey said they had money invested in cryptocurrencies, but another one in 10 was planning to do so in the future.SUPPLIEDTesla owner and investor Chris Clarke has also become a big investor in Tesla through the Hatch digital investment platform. But Watson said Sharesies did not offer any cryptocurrencies to its investors. The FSC report said the boom in online micro-investing had been partly driven by a rapid rise in share prices and cryptocurrencies as interest rates had fallen during the global pandemic. The pandemic had also accelerated the trend with close to 40 per cent of people who answered the survey were currently using, or planned to use, micro-investing platforms. The keenest adopters of micro-investing had been men, and younger people, the FSC found. “The disparity between the haves and have-nots has widened and the dream of homeownership for many of our younger generation is further away than ever,” Bessemer said. It was not only amassing wealth that drove people to become online investors. People told the FSC they enjoyed investing, and were attempting to educate themselves. DIGITAL INVESTING BY NUMBERS The FSC reported: 15 per cent of women, and 25 per cent of men, have used, or are using a micro-investing platform. 6.5 per cent of women, and 20 per cent of men, have had money cryptocurrencies, or currently have investments in cryptocurrencies. 27 per cent of people said the Covid pandemic made them take less investment risk, and 11 per cent said it made them take more. People gave multiple reasons for investing through online micro-investing platforms: Reasons included to grow their wealth (43 per cent), to improve their knowledge and capabilities (35 per cent), and to enjoy lower-fee investment (31 per cent). 67 per cent did not agree that micro-investing platforms were “fraught with risk”.

So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have stressed that rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time to come but recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal. ""That is exactly what makes tomorrow’s Fed meeting so interesting: market participants simply cannot be certain which aspect will weigh more heavily on the Fed’s mind"", Commerzbank analyst Esther Reichelt wrote in a note to her clients. Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter.  read more  Investors are hoping that U.S. retail sales and a manufacturing survey later on Tuesday will give clues as to what to expect from the Fed's statement and news conference on Wednesday. In the meantime though, prudence is palpable across trading floors. ""No USD trader will want to take too clear a position ahead of Wednesday’s meeting as uncertainties are simply too high"", Reichelt said. The dollar index edged lower in the Asian session and at 0716 GMT, was down 0.1% at 90.40 , hovering near multi-week highs. Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries  were at 1.48%, well below the 1.60% level they were trading at toward the beginning of June. The euro  rose 0.15% to $1.2126, just above a one-month low of $1.2093 it hit last week while the yen  hit a seven-session low of 110.02 per dollar. The Australian dollar  slipped to $0.7705 after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's last meeting showed the bank was prepared to keep buying bonds even though the economy has recovered its pre-pandemic output.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin  was able to steady above $40,000 on Tuesday and is approaching its 200-day moving average - finding support from the promise of fresh investment from major backer MicroStrategy and from Elon Musk.

Earlier this year, … [+5461 chars]",Wccftech,"Elon Musk’s complicated relationship with Bitcoin is doing more than aggravating cryptocurrency traders, it’s going to cause a major headache for Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) accountants.  Earlier this year, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin to place on its balance sheet pushing bitcoin to an all-time high of $63,000. But, as Elon Musk went on a Twitter tirade declaring Bitcoin as overly polluting and not in line with Tesla’s ESG mandate, the price collapsed bottoming out at $35,000.  Related Story All Publicity Is Good Publicity: Search Engine Queries on Tesla Surge as Rivals Take a Dig at the EV Giant via Super Bowl AdsBut here’s the even bigger risk for Tesla: the nature of bitcoin on the balance sheet will have an impairment effect on the company’s books and force it to do a write-down and demolish several quarters of profits — which are sometimes at best tenuous. Tesla’s last quarterly earnings showed that the company was booking more profit from bitcoin’s gains and trading of carbon credits rather than selling cars. And still, the company only booked a pre-tax profit of $15 million, along with an impairment charge of $28 million.  Tesla is only going to experience the downside of holding bitcoin on the balance sheet, and not the upside. Tesla’s Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Problem MicroStrategy, which also has a significant amount of bitcoin on its balance sheet, has put together a guide explaining how bitcoin is treated by corporate treasuries:     However, we believe that cryptocurrencies would generally meet the definition of an indefinite-lived intangible asset because they do not convey specific rights in the same way as financial instruments. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are required to be recognized and measured at their historical cost; impairment is recognized when their carrying amount exceeds fair value. The subsequent reversal of previously recognized impairment losses is prohibited In it describes what accountants call indefinite-lived intangible assets, an asset class usually reserved to quantify the value prescribed to brands or trademarks.  There’s a problem: these can only be written down in value, never written up. Gains are only realized when assets are sold.  Tesla even discloses this in its 10K: Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. As we currently intend to hold these assets long-term, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. If the laser eyes push bitcoin to a price higher than what Tesla bought the bitcoin for, it does nothing for the balance sheet of the company in the eyes of shareholders. Theoretically, there will be some unrealized gains that give the company more liquidity; on paper, the bitcoin is worth $45,000 but if the market dictates bitcoin is now worth $90,000 there’s a significant pool of liquidity on hand. But if bitcoin’s value drops to a price below what Tesla bought the tokens for, it's a massive hit on the car markers balance sheet. But There’s Also Another Weird Trick CFOs seem to understand that bitcoin is a tricky beast to properly hold on the balance sheet. A survey by Gartner released in February found only 5% of business executives intended to invest in bitcoin as a corporate asset this year. Most companies don't have the enthusiasm for bitcoin that Microstrategy has, or Tesla once had.   “Eighty-four percent of the respondents said that bitcoin’s volatility posed a financial risk,” said Alexander Bant, chief of research in the Gartner Finance practice. “It would be extremely difficult to mitigate the kind of price swings seen in the cryptocurrency in the last five years.” So what do you do when the volatility of the underlying asset creates a scenario where you could be faced with a massive impairment on your balance sheet unrelated to the material wellbeing of the company? Create a subsidiary to hold the bitcoin, firewalling the parent from the worst gyrations of the asset but giving plenty of ways to benefit from the upside.  MicroStrategy Completes $500 Million Offering of 6.125% Senior Secured Notes Due 2028 with #Bitcoin Use of Proceeds. @MicroStrategy’s existing approximately 92,079 bitcoins are being held by a newly formed subsidiary, MacroStrategy LLC. $MSTRhttps://t.co/avdKhHDLMH — Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) June 14, 2021 That’s exactly what MicroStrategy did. The firm that pioneered digital assets on the balance sheet has formed a subsidiary, MacroStrategy LLC, which will hold approximately the 92,079 bitcoin that MicroStrategy has acquired. The worth of the company’s total bitcoin holding comes to around $3.37 billion at current prices. The debt that MicroStrategy is taking out to fund the bitcoin purchases for MacroStrategy will be secured by MicroStrategy itself, however,  But Tesla wasn’t that patient. By acting with Musk’s compulsiveness and obsession Tesla and its shareholders got the worst of both worlds: a bear market, and the inability to use bitcoin as an asset with a long time horizon. The impairments are sure to push down Tesla’s stock, and its shareholders will have another reason to be annoyed with Musk.            Share this story      Facebook  Twitter  ",2021-06-15

Roberts noted that local interest in crypto assets had piqued amid the recent Bitcoin Miami conference — which took place earlier this month and drew crowds of approximately 50,000 according to its organizers.He noted there has been a “tremendous response” to E11EVEN's announced support for crypto, adding it had already collected its first deposit in crypto before officially announcing it would accept digital assets.Roberts added that E11EVEN is now roughly one month away from collecting its second crypto deposit, predicting the down payment will be worth between 10% and 15% of the property’s sale price.The company offers plush high-rise residences in Miami’s Park West district. Prices for the lavish units start at $377,400, according to real estate agent Miami Residential. The 65 story condominium has 375 units, with the penthouse expecting to fetch as much as $10 million.Roberts described supporting crypto as one the firm’s “greatest decisions,” warning: “those that don't embrace [crypto] will be left behind:”“I think the whole movement is trending towards more buyers paying in crypto and we are very excited to be the first people to take cryptocurrency for deposits on real estate.”Related: DJ David Guetta puts luxury Miami pad up for sale, will accept 380 Bitcoin for itThe real estate mogul acknowledged the volatile nature of digital assets, but was confident that the younger generation is unperturbed by price fluctuations and have already embraced digital assets. When asked if he immediately liquidates crypto deposits to eliminate the volatility, Roberts offered little clarity, stating: “It’s all so new and we’re studying and we’re trying to embrace the movement.”In mid-May, Cointelegraph reported that investors could buy luxury apartments in Portugal using Dogecoin among other digital assets.Also in May, it was reported that Miami’s Arte Surfside luxury apartments, home to Ivanka Trump, were accepting payment for real estate in multiple cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

She stated that the bank has been looking into the matter for the better part of two years and feels confident they have a viable product to launch before 2022. “Before the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to the populace,” Mohammed stated.CBN’s digital currency will not replace local naira cash notes but instead, act as a complementary currency option. The digital currency is also expected to make foreign remittances easier for Nigeria. Digital currencies offer more flexibility for remittances due to the lack of forex charges and third-party entities. This is also one of the reasons El Salvador recently adopted bitcoin as legal tender.At this stage, experts are creating architecture and addressing privacy concerns. Much like China has done with the digital yuan, Nigeria has plans to launch a pilot program in select areas before a nationwide release. Mohammed added that the CBN estimates that 80% of central banks globally are looking into digital currencies and Nigeria does not want to be left in the dust.Whether the 80% estimate is accurate, what is true is that several African countries are in similar stages of planning for CBDCs.Yesterday, Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan requested that the Central Bank of Tanzania begin looking into CBDCs. The speech was given at the inauguration of the Central Bank of Swahili building in Mwanza.Ghana has also stated it was one of the first apex banks on the continent to introduce its CBDC. The Bank of Ghana’s government stated that the digital cedi was on its way toward implementation.Story continuesThe South African Reserve Bank (SARB) also has plans on looking into the possibility of releasing its own digital currency by the end of next year.Nigeria’s love/hate relationship with cryptocurrencyThe CBDC announcement is a curious move for a nation that recently has been clamping down on cryptocurrencies over the last few months. Even going so far as to ban commercial banks and other financial institutions from doing business with cryptocurrency exchanges and instructing that accounts holding crypto be closed.The official reason for this ban was that Nigerian officials believed that crypto exchanges and start-ups were adding to foreign currency shortages. Those shortages caused the depreciation of the naira on the black market. The ban was later amended to allow peer-to-peer crypto trading.",2021-06-15

The initiative attracted attention for its “HODL MODL” treasury management strategy — with the non-profit accepting donations in Bitcoin that it will not touch until 2025. According to the charity’s website, a total of 32.5949 BTC has been donated so far, which equates to more than $1.3 million at current prices. The charity is hoping to leverage the hypothetical gains Bitcoin could make over the coming years. A June 14 blog post from U.S.-based crypto exchange Gemini — which is providing crypto custody services for the trust — asserts that donations received by the charity today could have a much larger impact if held into the future: “This new charity model — the HODL MODL — creates a new paradigm for charitable giving. It brings the HODL ethos of Bitcoin to charitable giving, and means your bitcoin donation today could make an even bigger impact tomorrow.”Gemini’s founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have also agreed to match the first 50 Bitcoin donated to the Bitcoin Water Trust. “We’re thrilled to help a fellow mission-driven organization like Charity: water accept bitcoin and maximize its humanitarian efforts,” the post added. Charity: water was founded in 2006, with the non-profi working to launch community-owned water projects that provide clean water and sanitation to developing nations. The organization first began accepting Bitcoin donations in 2014. Related: The rise of crypto charities: Elongate and Munch raise millions for various causes.Charity has become a popular topic within the crypto industry in recent months after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated billions worth of SHIB tokens that had been airdropped to his wallet by the meme-coin’s creators. Buterin donated one-tenth of his SHIB holdings to charity after burning the remaining 90% to deter other altcoin developers from airdropping massive quantities of their token’s supply to his wallets for promotion. The India Covid Relief Fund was among the top recipients of Buterin’s dog-token stash, receiving more than $1 billion worth of SHIB. On May 31, the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — an organization that supports human rights activism globally — launched several Bitcoin-based grants as part of its $210,000 Bitcoin Development fund.

Initially enabling the transfer of UMBR (Umbria's governance token) between the Ethereum Mainnet and Matic Mainnet, the second stage of Narni's development will see it compatible with other assets, and integrating with other blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain and subsequently any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible chain.   The Umbria development team is focused on creating a supreme user experience and promoting blockchain interoperability and compatibility. Currently anyone moving assets from Ethereum to the Polygon network (previously Matic) can experience slow transaction speeds, high fees and the confusing technical challenge of configuring their cryptocurrency wallet to work with multiple chains. By using a different transfer mechanism to comparable bridges, the Narni 'insta-bridge' will ensure users can quickly and economically migrate assets from one network to another in just a few clicks. The Narni insta-bridge will also automatically suggest the correct configuration for Metamask to track assets on the pertinent networks.  Narni will make the superior features afforded by the Umbria DEX and Umbria farms much easier to access and will open up the platform to a wider audience. Another key feature will be the ability to provide liquidity to the bridge to earn high APY. On launch, this facility will be available for UMBR on both the Ethereum and Polygon networks and will be quickly extended to other assets. Liquidity provision on the Narni bridge will be a compelling proposition for stablecoin farmers, who usually generate low APY when pooling. The developers of Narni expect the majority of bridged assets to be stablecoins such as USDT and USDC - subsequently earning a large volume of fees for the liquidity providers. These fees will potentially generate far greater APYs than those offered in traditional DeFi farming as liquidity is used more efficiently than in traditional AMM pools.Umbria's Narni bridge, which is named after the famous Bridge of Augustus, a Roman arch bridge in the Italian city of Narni in the Umbria region, is due to launch in a few weeks time for transfers between Polygon-ETH chains. ""The release of Narni will be a watershed moment in providing our community with an improved user experience across our DeFi products and services. Narni will be a hub for transferring between chains and solve the current issue of lack of blockchain interoperability and scalability,"" commented Barney Chambers, co-lead and co-founder of Umbria Network. ""We are moving towards being blockchain agnostic; ultimately Umbria's bridge will realise full frictionless interoperability between a universe of chains."" The Umbria team will be hosting an Ask Me Anything event on its Discord server to answer any questions from the community. The date and time will be announced soon via Umbria's social media channels (Discord, Telegram, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook. Anyone interested in participating can also send an email to [email protected] and will be notified once the time has been finalised.See the latest data on UMBR on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/umbria-network/news/https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/umbria-networkAbout UmbriaUmbria is a decentralized protocol that is creating low-cost and easy-to-use DeFi applications by leveraging Layer 2 technology on Ethereum. It aims to demystify and simplify DeFi and get people accessing innovative financial services and products as well as earning income on their crypto. Using Polygon's (formerly Matic) Ethereum scaling solution, Umbria is developing a suite of popular DeFi features at fractional on-chain cost of many current DeFi platforms with greater transaction speed while maintaining all the cryptographic security provided by Ethereum. Umbria is forking the best features of current DeFi projects and simplifying the over-complicated user-experience, which currently acts as a barrier to entry for those with limited experience and knowledge of cutting-edge cryptocurrency technologies. The Umbria governance token is available on Uniswap as well as Umbria's DEX (Decentralised Exchange). Users can deposit cryptocurrency as liquidity in liquidity pools on the Umbria DEX and earn fees from token swapping and earn additional Umbria as an incentive for providing liquidity to certain pairs. UMBR-MATIC LP tokens can be staked in the UMBR-MATIC farm, which is currently paying 248% APY (as of June 7th, 2021). The Umbria token will also enable users in the network to take control over decision-making and have voting power over the development and governance of Umbria's protocol.Other facilities will continue to come online (via developers and community initiatives) which will utilise the Umbria protocol and its governance token.UK-publicly listed Online Blockchain plc (LSE: OBC) acts as Umbria's coordinator, administrator and advisor.Francesca De Franco, [email protected], +44 794 125 3135SOURCE Online Blockchain plc           Search When typing in this field, a list of search results will appear and be automatically updated as you type.

Japan's Nikkei (.N225) rose 0.89% in early trading and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 0.23%. An early driver was Australian shares <.AXJO>, which rose 1.03%, though Chinese blue chips (.CSI300) dropped 0.16% and Hong Kong (.HSI) fell 0.21%. All three resumed trading after being shut on Monday for a public holiday. Overnight the S&P 500  fell 0.25%. U.S. stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis , were also up  0.11%. ""We are still getting markets responding positively to the lower volatility in the bond markets and lower yields, and a sense that inflation will be reasonably temporary and the Fed won't have to slam the breaks on,"" said Kyle Rodda, market analyst at brokerage IG. ""I suspect in the next 24-48 hours we'll see a lot of chop, first on the upside, then a little correction as the market positions itself, and then we're off to the races if we get the green light from the Fed Thursday morning,"" said Rodda. Traders will look closely at any hints from the meeting's final statement about whether and when the Fed plans to taper its bond buying programme, amid concerns from some quarters about inflation as the U.S. economy bounces back from the pandemic fallout. The two-day meeting starts on Tuesday. Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a taper announcement will come in the next quarter, despite a patchy recovery in the job market.  read more  ""Whilst no immediate changes in monetary policy are anticipated, an increase in the share of FOMC members who think rates will need to increase in 2023 is expected,"" analysts at ANZ wrote in a note to clients.

As for commodities, U.S. crude  ticked up 0.55% to $71.27 a barrel, and Brent crude  was at $73.24 per barrel, having touched on Monday $73.64 a barrel, its highest since April 2019. Spot gold  was down slightly at $1862.21 per ounce. Even bitcoin  was fairly quiet, fluctuating a little above $40 000.

Cryptocurrencies –… [+6455 chars]",Gizmodo Australia,"It seems like every man and his dog has jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon in recent months, but for many people across the globe, they are legally not allowed to participate.         Cryptocurrencies – by definition – are decentralised and unregulated by central banks, which means there are no international laws that govern how it all works. While this has been a major reason why people have moved towards cryptocurrencies, many governments around the world have remained hesitant and even gone so far as to ban the currencies. Where Are Cryptocurrencies Legal Tender? As it currently stands, only one country – El Salvador – has officially moved to recognise Bitcoin as legal tender. Earlier this month, El Salvador Congress officially approved a proposal by President Nayib Bukele to allow bitcoin to be accepted as an official form of payment. Where Are Cryptocurrencies Banned? Thailand Thailand is the most recent country to announce cryptocurrency bans, particularly relating to everyone’s favourite internet trend: meme coins. [related_content first=”1695934″] The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implemented a new ban on coins like Doge and Shiba Inu last week. It has ordered that all meme coins, social and utility tokens and NFTs be delisted from exchanges accessible in Thailand within the next 30 days. “The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Board has approved the new rules that prohibit digital asset exchanges from providing services in relation to utility tokens and certain types of cryptocurrencies,” the SEC posting reads. “The rules also specify that the exchanges set a requirement to be imposed in the event that digital tokens issued by their own exchange or related persons are listed on the exchange. In this regard, the token issuer who fails to comply with the white paper and relevant rules in substance could risk having such tokens delisted from the exchange. This new regulatory guideline aims to enhance protection of digital asset traders’ interest.” According to the SEC, the ban is aimed at protecting citizens from tokens with “no clear objective or substance” which are often influenced heavily by social media, as we’ve seen with Elon Musk’s Twitter commentary. While this would obviously include the likes of Doge and Cumrocket, it’s unclear if more reputable currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have also been heavily swayed by social media trends, would be included as well. As per the official SEC statement, the following crypto-related items are banned, however, the wording is vague and could be open to interpretation:  Meme token: having no clear objective or substance or underlying, and whose price running on social media trends; Fan token: tokenized by the fame of influencers; Non-fungible token (NFT): a digital creation to declare ownership or grant of right in an object or specific right. It is unique and not interchangeable with digital tokens of the same category and type at the equal amount; Digital tokens which are utilized in a blockchain transaction and issued by digital asset exchanges or related persons.  Gizmodo Australia has contacted the Thai government for clarification. China China has not only moved to ban meme coins, but has essentially made it illegal to trade cryptocurrency altogether. The country recently moved to ban banks and online payment channels from trading, clearing, settling or accepting cryptocurrencies, essentially banning Chinese residents from participating. “Recently, crypto currency prices have skyrocketed and plummeted, and speculative trading of cryptocurrency has rebounded, seriously infringing on the safety of people’s property and disrupting the normal economic and financial order,” a joint statement from three Chinese industry bodies said, according to Reuters. It’s worth noting that the government has not banned individuals from possessing cryptocurrencies, but has banned exchanges. Following the effective ban back in May, a number of major cryptocurrencies took a huge tumble, with many still trying to recover more than a month later. Russia Despite being the native country of one of crypto’s biggest names – Vitalik Buterin – Russia has not been fond of cryptocurrency thus far. It was actually banned until quite recently. It was only on January of 2021 that crypto — including meme coins — has been allowed in Russia. This means  you can trade, mine and own cryptocurrency without any legal ramifications, provided you aren’t using the currency to spend on other goods and services within Russia. However, the law still prevents Russians from using crypto as payment. Ecuador Ecuador moved to ban Bitcoin way back in 2014 ahead of launching its own digital currency. However, this has done very little to stop traders. As part of a greater monetary and financial law reform, then-President Rafael Correa signed a bill that made bitcoin illegal in the country. Bitcoin businesses were demanded to “shut down their operations immediately,” according to a Panam Post article at the time. “Those who defy the ban will face prosecution, and all bitcoins circulated and assets in bitcoin trades face confiscation.” Bolivia Back in 2014, around the same time that Ecuador issued its crypto ban, Bolivia moved to ban any currency or coin not issued by the government. “It is illegal to use any kind of currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorised entity,” a translation of the statement released by the central bank said. This ban includes Bitcoin, meme coins and any other currency that isn’t issued by a government body, with the Bolivian authorities citing protection of its own dollar, and of citizens as its reason for implementing the policy. Bangladesh Bangladesh Bank – the country’s central bank – moved to ban cryptocurrency including Bitcoin back in December 2017, citing that it is not a legal currency in any other country in the world (however, it’s worth noting that El Salvador now considers it to be one). “Transaction with this currency may cause a violation of the existing money laundering and terrorist financing regulations,” a news release on the Bangladesh Bank website reads. Iran While Iran hasn’t officially banned crypto, it has banned crypto mining for at least four months in 2021 after the country experienced widespread blackouts as a result of the power usage of mining. This is significant because as much as 4.5 per cent of all Bitcoin mining is from Iran, which accounts for more than 2GW of power being drained from the grid per day, according to the BBC. The ban is in place until September 22, 2021.",2021-06-15

The market is laden with lots of exciting opportunities and rewards for who are willing to jump on the bandwagon.Plus, the market is devoid of the control of the central government; meaning the market is far from being manipulated like the traditional fiat currencies of the world.In a bid to further open up the crypto market to more investors, the team at Crypto Pote Token announces that its utility token, POPE, would be listed on ProBit on June 16, 2021. Crypto Pote Token is a blockchain-powered project designed and developed on the Binance Smart Chain network.POPE will be an option to store in for value against inflation as well as a good way to create passive income without any past experience knowledge, since just holding the POPE tokens allows earning a part of the transaction fees paid by users.Here is the listing information for the token:Trading Pairs:POPE/USDTDeposit: June 15, 2021, 08:00 UTC Trading: June 16, 2021, 08:00 UTCWhy Should You Be Part Of The Crypto Pote Token Movement?The Crypto Pote Token is a promising project that every crypto enthusiast should be part of. For every transaction on the Crypto Pote Token's protocol, a 2% fee is charged and half of the fee is distributed to all token holders depending on their portfolio. The remaining half would be burned to reduce the amount of POPE in circulation.A reduction in the number of tokens in circulation will lead to scarcity and higher prices, which is good for the project. In addition, token holders and investors will be able to sell their assets at a minimum price known in advance thanks to a guarantee fund provided in case of dump.This guarantee fund comes from 40% of the pre-sale revenues and will be adjusted every week following the burn that takes place on each transaction.As a result, the minimum price of the token will increase every week when it is revised.Story continuesThe token was designed to be as close as possible to the basic philosophy of the cryptocurrency.It is a decentralised asset programmed to be a store of value against fiat currencies and which generates passive income by the simple fact of holding assets as in any bank account.The strong point that sets this project apart from others is that it does not apply crazy transaction fees and that there is a guarantee fund generated by the pre-sale that is there to limit dumps as much as possible. Each week you know in advance how far the price can fall and you can be sure that you can always sell your assets at a price that is already known in advance.Finally, the project is designed to make the token holders as responsible as possible for their assets.Indeed, it is announced that in order to earn passive income on transaction fees, it is imperative to hold one's tokens on one's own wallet. Holding POPE at probit does not generate any redistribution on transaction fees.This will encourage people to hold their own wallet which is much more secure and in line with the basic philosophy of cryptocurrencies.The project is of course compatible with decentralised exchanges. This means that anyone does not have to depend on a centralized exchange.Social links:Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/cFPXKi-pLW0xYzRkDiscord: https://discord.gg/nBPnG3yrGqMedia Contact:Company: Crypto Pote TokenWebsite: https://cryptopotetoken.finance/ E-mail: admin@cryptopotetoken.finance",2021-06-15

Pre-Fed price action would suggest markets aren’t anticipating any big trauma from policy normalisation at the world’s leading central bank. And that’s helping keep the bulls in play. Equities in Europe look set to nudge up and stay around yesterday’s fresh historic peaks as the recovery-induced trade displays its full potential, and Wall Street too is poised for a positive start after yet another record close. Volatility gauges on both sides of the Atlantic have dipped to new pre-pandemic lows and bond yields across developed counties are moving around the mid point of the last three months’ trading range, illustrating the fairly relaxed mood. The two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicks off today and although it is not expected to announce any plan to pare its bond purchases it may offer hints the discussion has began, amid some concerns about growing inflationary pressures. JP Morgan said the upcoming tapering process was unlikely to hurt its bullish view on equities for the second half of 2021. It expects the Fed to start tapering early next year. Back to today’s agenda, investors will keep an eye on a number of ECB speakers but that comes after abundant reassurances - the latest from president Lagarde yesterday - that it’s too early to even talk about withdrawing support. And in Asia Pacific, similar soundings came from Australia, where its central bank members said in the June meeting’s minutes that it was too early to end the bank’s bond buying programme. Meantime in Japan a former Bank of Japan policymaker said the bank must eventually consider ways to unload its huge holdings of exchange-traded funds after tapering bond and ETF purchases. But the timing will be years away. On the corporate front, the U.S. and Europe are expected to announce a truce in their 17-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies on Tuesday. That could help planemakers Boeing and Airbus and also bring relief to other industries. Good news also on the COVID-19 front. A new analysis has shown that vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca offer protection of more than 90% against hospitalisation from the Delta coronavirus variant. Finally, bitcoin steadied after climbing above the $40,000 mark following remarks from Elon Musk who said Tesla may resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: * German final CPI/HICP * UK payrolled employees surge by 197,000 in May * ECB speakers: board member Philip Lane 1100 GMT; board member Fabio Panetta 1300 GMT; chief supervisor Andrea Enria 1000 GMT * BoE: Governor Andrew Bailey speech at TheCityUK conference * U.S. retail sales May/industrial output * U.S. TIC data showing overseas buying of Treasuries * Auctions: U.S. 6-month bills, U.S. 20-year; UK 7-year gilt, 30-year gilt; German 2-year",2021-06-15

A day after the tweet, the value of Bitcoin rose more than 10 per cent. The world's largest currency was trading above $40,000 (roughly Rs. 29 lakh) on June 15 morning according to CoinDesk, adding nearly $5,000 (roughly Rs. 3.6 lakh) to its value since Musk tweeted about it on Sunday.Dogecoin, which started as a meme currency but received a lot of support from the billionaire tycoon in the past few months also gained in value. But this positive trend in the cryptocurrency market is no guarantee that it will see the bull run, which started at the beginning of this year, again so soon. At most, the value addition to the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past two days most likely seems temporary.Musk and Bitcoin have had an uneasy relationship. Initially, he said on social media that he supported Bitcoin. In February, Tesla revealed that it has bought $1.5 billion (roughly Rs. 10,990 crore) worth of Bitcoin. Subsequently, the electric vehicle company said it would accept the cryptocurrency for payments. By April, Bitcoin had touched its all-time high value of nearly $65,000 (roughly Rs. 47.3 lakh), a massive spike of over 450 per cent in just six months.In early May, however, Musk tweeted a Tesla statement that said the company was suspending Bitcoin payments because of the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for mining and transactions. The abrupt announcement came as a shock to many investors who wondered whether Musk was changing his position on cryptocurrencies.This, coupled with a Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency trading, led to huge volatility in the market, and Bitcoin and other big digital currencies crashed massively. At one point of time in May, Bitcoin traded around $30,000 (Rs 21.8 lakh) but its has been fluctuating through the year.The billionaire tycoon has however said repeatedly that he supported cryptocurrencies and believed they have the potential to become the future currency of the world.The trajectory of Dogecoin's price in India, however, has remained uneven so far this year, having plunged to $0.22 (roughly Rs. 16) on May 19 after soaring to an all-time high of $0.74 (roughly Rs. 54) on May 8. By June 15, the coin had recovered some of its losses to trade at $0.32 (roughly Rs. 23). There have been calls for Dogecoin to reach $1 (roughly Rs. 73) by the end of this year, but it's difficult to say whether that is achievable.Popular brands such as Snickers chocolate and Slim Jim beef jerky, too, have extended support to the meme currency in the past.Guess what day it is? #DogeDay.

Notably, Elon Musk will not be a part of the mining council, though he has held a call related to the council in the past.Musk’s tweets set off a storm of headlines related to bitcoin’s energy consumption, which subsequently sent the cryptocurrency’s price tanking. The Tesla CEO said that the company would stop accepting bitcoin payments for Teslas until mining switched to cleaner sources of energy.Recently, he updated the status on this by saying that if there was confirmation of approximately 50% of mining using clean energy, as well as a “positive future trend,” Tesla would start accepting bitcoin again. This helped bitcoin’s price up, on top of the approval of the Taproot upgrade for the network.The Bitcoin Mining Council itself is an organization composed loosely of individuals, groups, and miners that will focus on bringing positive changes to mining on the network. The FAQ on the council’s page goes so far as to say that it will not involve Elon Musk, assuaging the market’s concerns on the Tesla CEO, which it has grown upset with.",2021-06-15

It seems like the Earth wanted an Indian-market Hyundai Venue, because it sure as hell took one over the weekend.          This happened at a parking lot in the Ghatkopar West area of Mumbai on Sunday morning, and, so you can watch this guilt-free, I’ll mention that no one was injured:  #WATCH| Car sinks into the ground in Mumbai’s #Ghatkopar amid heavy rainfall pic.twitter.com/i3bbmqaN6x — TOI Mumbai (@TOIMumbai) June 13, 2021  Holy crap. That’s terrifying. The person talking that just says “oh, shit” pretty much sums this all up perfectly: Abig chunk of concrete parking lot just somehow yields away into nothingness, revealing a watery chasm beneath, which then swallows that Hyundai down like a Tatooine Sarlacc at lunchtime. What’s especially strange is how the cars parked but a few feet away aren’t affected at all. Just imagine coming out to this parking lot, keys to your new Hyundai in hand, trotting up to the spot where you parked and doing a crushingly slow burn as you look to the void where your car should be, then that water-filled hole, and just letting your brain do the maths. Oof. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is in charge of maintenance of the area, though this appears to have taken place on private property. From their statement: “The incident took place in a private society compound. Nobody got injured in the incident as no one was inside the car. We are helping in pumping out water from the well and have asked the society to cordon off the well area after removing the car.” It seems that the parking lot may have been built on a reinforced concrete over a well? That doesn’t really seem like a fantastic idea. The car seems to have been dragged out of the well now, and the dangerous area cordoned off, though I have yet to find an explanation why the car’s brake lights — including the CHMSL — appear to be on, if no one was inside. A water-induced electrical short? I hope so. Also, I wonder if a rear-engined car, like a Tata Nano, might have avoided sinking in, since the hole was under the heavy nose of this car. I guess that probably doesn’t really matter, though.",2021-06-15

Has the NFT bubble already burst?Non-fungible tokens took the art world by storm earlier this year. NFTs are a type of digital asset designed to show someone has ownership of a unique virtual item, such as online pictures and videos or even sports trading cards.In March, South Carolina-based graphic designer Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, sold an NFT for a record $69 million at a Christie's auction. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, sold his first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million later that month.More recently, a rare digital avatar known as a CryptoPunk sold at Sotheby's for over $11.7 million on Thursday. Total NFT sales reached an eye-watering $2 billion in the first quarter, according to data from Nonfungible, a website which tracks the market.But new data shows the NFT hype is fading. Overall sales plunged from a seven-day peak of $176 million on May 9, to just $8.7 million on June 15, according to numbers from Nonfungible. That means volumes are now roughly back where they were at the start of 2021. Meanwhile, prices of major NFTs appear to be sliding. CryptoPunks, one of the most popular NFT projects, fell from a weekly average of $99,720 in early May to $50,840 at the start of June. SuperRare digital art prices have fallen on average from a record of $31,778 to $5,342 in a similar timespan.One of the main reasons for the sharp drop in the NFT market was a sudden rise and fall in sales of new crypto collectible items called MeeBits — made by the creators of CryptoPunks — according to Gauthier Zuppinger, chief operating officer of Nonfungible.""The thing is that, each time you'll notice such a quick increase on any trend, you'll see a relative decrease, which basically stands for a market stabilization,"" he told CNBC.Geoff Osler, CEO and co-founder of NFT app S!NG, said the digital collectibles craze was likely driven by ""pent-up demand"" from wealth accumulated from rising cryptocurrency prices, and that the market now seems to be calming in tandem with a drop in crypto markets. Bitcoin, for example, has fallen from a record high of nearly $65,000 in April to just over $39,000 as of Monday. Proponents of NFTs don't see the recent slowdown as the end of the road for the market.""High-profile NFTs selling for millions of dollars was a sure sign that the market was treating them as speculative assets,"" Nadya Ivanova, chief operating officer of L'Atelier, a research firm affiliated with BNP Paribas, told CNBC.""And by definition, markets for speculative assets are unstable and liable to dry up.""""The bigger question for NFTs is their long-term value, which we believe is likely significant,"" Ivanova added. ""As augmented and virtual reality technology matures, normal people are going to spend more and more of their time — and therefore money — in virtual environments.""It's worth noting there's been talk of augmented and virtual reality taking off in the tech industry for years, with companies from Facebook to Microsoft making big bets in the space. But the tech is yet to see mainstream adoption. Still, some in the crypto space are betting NFTs could play a role in the development of immersive virtual worlds.Another potential use of NFTs we may hear more about in the months ahead is music, according to S!NG's Osler. Artists such as Kings of Leon and Steve Aoki, for example, have jumped into the NFT frenzy.""We have only seen the tiniest part of where this is going,"" Osler told CNBC. ""Cryptocurrency is here to stay — and NFTs mean there is now something to buy. It's the other side of the equation. And this is going to go a long way past digital art. We think music is next.""The NFT phenomenon has some issues to resolve before it becomes a widespread method of proving ownership of art and other original content, though. Copyright is a big one. A number of artists and content creators have complained their work is being stolen and sold on as NFTs online.Osler said it's important that legal protections are added ""directly into the NFTs themselves,"" and that consumers ""have legal recourse if something goes wrong.""Zuppinger expects there will be ""more and more promising projects in the next few months and years.""""We are reached out every day by promising projects, large companies, banking groups all around the world that are gradually entering the NFT space, so we're pretty confident that the NFT space is not 'dead',"" he told CNBC.",2021-06-15

This groundbreaking on-chain trading service allows mass users who want to trade tokens employing the so-called tax structure (i.e. Safemoon protocol) to the transactions to do so freely without technical barriers, just as they trade with their centralized exchanges.   Continue Reading                  Beowulf PTE LTD        This service is a monumental accomplishment for the DeFi community because, when considering traditional centralized exchanges, such tax structure would not be preserved; this puts the holders of the crypto assets at a disadvantage. On the other hand, in these decentralized exchanges, the trading is inherently more difficult for the mass users who can hardly grasp the concept of public/private keys and/or the management of the Metamask. Therefore, on-chain trading may carry risks. Technological and hacking risks inherent to the handling of private keys without proper customer support may lead to the complete loss of crypto assets. For example, an average user may face the risk of losing their funds as there is a lack of proper security procedures as well as full-service processes in place to safeguard users' assets when executing trading activities on-chain.  DeFiato is designed to address these shortfalls from these on-chain/off-chain DeFi models. DeFiato is a centralized DeFi platform underpinned by the original vision to provide a first-of-its-kind infrastructure in the context of the ""DeFi"" world, while at the same time, seamlessly bridging the gap between ""Fiat"" and ""crypto"" toward mass adoption. DeFiato is the next-generation cryptocurrency platform distinguished for its simplicity and security in serving B2B and B2C customers. By relying on its user-friendly accessibility, intuitive interface, and full customer service, as well as the built-in analytics and actionable token insights for users, DeFiato is uniquely positioned to remove any barriers of entry and provide all users, even newcomers, the same ability as the big players in supporting their favorite blockchain projects, while earning rewards at the same time. To kickstart this innovative service, we will support Binance Smart Chain with the listing of BNB, BUSD, and USDT on Wednesday, June 16, 2021. Defiato will also list SAFEMOON and FAN8 tokens subsequently on June 18, 2021. Users can start trading these tokens as well, without a barrier or metamask, while preserving the tax structure on-chain for the crypto asset holders.""Our mission is to empower users not only to have the opportunity to earn, but also take part in the decentralization of cryptocurrency networks, and in the process, usher in a new era of blockchain and crypto adoption like never before,"" said Dr. William H.

This target is the 0.5 Fib retracement level.Technical indicators are decisively bullish. The MACD is positive and the RSI has increased above the 50-line. Furthermore, the Stochastic oscillator has already made a bullish cross (green icon). All these signs indicate that an eventual breakout is likely.BTC Chart By TradingViewHowever, the two-hour chart is showing weakness. The MACD has given a bearish reversal signal and the RSI has generated a bearish divergence. Both these signs suggest a short-term pullback is expected.If so, the $38,000 area is both a horizontal support level and coincides with a potential ascending support line drawn from the June 8 lows.

It seems that the channel contains an A-B-C corrective structure.A high of $43,950 would take the price all the way to the resistance line of the channel and would also give waves A:C a 1:1 ratio.Therefore, it’s likely that a high will be reached close to that level.

Meanwhile, a run through IndoEx’s reviews by its previous customers showed them accusing both Spencer and North of bearing fake identities.‘Spencer Collins (CEO/CFO), Grace North (CTO) is fake person, work as support in telegram chat,” wrote Leo99 in his grievance on Bitcoin forum BitcoinTalk.org. “Continually postpone solving all problems for the future or ignore messages.”A deeper look into IndoEx LTD’s official filings with the U.K. Registrar office showed that it received a First Gazette Notice in November 2020 for not sharing details about its shareholders. The company responded to the authority with only one name, Collins Spencer, who holds 1,200 shares, hinting that IndoEx is an individually-owned company.The U.K. Registrar later struck off the notice against IndoEx LTD. Nonetheless, the exchange continues to operate without approval from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). FCA directory returned no results matching IndoEx LTDThe research led to three key takeaways:The WEBD price pump-and-dump originated from one exchange called IndoEx, operating under a U.K.-registered entity called IndoEx LTD.Collins Spencer, the only stakeholder in the company, does not exist anywhere on social media.IndoEx’s Linkedin profile boasts about having 10–50 employees, but only three of them are using the business-oriented social media service. All of them have hidden LinkedIn profiles and are from Indonesia, not the United Kingdom.Evidence so far points that IndoEx was instrumental in single-handedly pumping and dumping the WEBD token on Monday. The token was trading flat during Tuesday. ",2021-06-15

The outage seems to have started around 11:30am on Tuesday, June 15, and it appears that the issues are happening unevenly — three Gadgets 360 team members got an error message while trying to access the app, while it was opening normally for two persons.[Update, June 15, 1.42pm: HDFC has now tweeted that the issue has been resolved and the mobile banking app is working again. However, the bank did not give any details about what the issue was.]As of now, the bank has not given any statement about what the cause of this issue was, only saying that it is looking into the issue. However, debit card payments and netbanking both seem to be working at the moment - only the Mobile banking app appears to have been affected. A tweet by HDFC's corporate communications head said, ""We are experiencing some issues on the MobileBanking App. We are looking into this on priority and will update shortly. Customers are requested to please use NetBanking to complete their transaction. Regret the inconvenience caused. Thank you."" The official HDFC Bank News handle also posted a similar tweet:We are experiencing some issues on the MobileBanking App. We are looking into this on priority and will update shortly. Customers are requested to please use NetBanking to complete their transaction. Regret the inconvenience caused. Thank you.— HDFC Bank News (@HDFCBankNews) June 15, 2021As of now the reason for this outage is not clear, but according to service outage tracker DownDetector.in, there was a spike in reports of problems with HDFC Bank from around 10:30am, peaking at 11:30am. However, the problem does not seem to be evenly spread as some members of our team who are customers of HDFC bank were able to access their accounts as usual.This is part of a number of similar incidents that have affected India's online banking sector; HDFC had similar glitches in March, and a huge outage in November. ICICI Bank also experienced a similar outage earlier, and at an industry conclave in March, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das had to urge banks to strengthen cyber security and tech infrastructure.Interested in cryptocurrency?

He is playing the same game he did with the stock market,” said Nurm.“After he was banned by the SEC from tweeting about Tesla, he has shifted focus to the crypto market, where he can run free on social media for now,” he added.The CoinSwap founder sees turmoil in the markets at present largely thanks to the ever-changing temperament of Musk, which appears to run hot and cold. Earlier in the year, Musk announced Tesla would accept Bitcoin as a payment option for its electric cars, only to reverse his decision weeks later. More recently, Musk reversed his decision once again, announcing that Tesla would accept Bitcoin as a payment option once 50% of its mining was carried out with clean energy usage.Related: Elon Musk lays out when Tesla will begin accepting Bitcoin paymentsBut Musk’s erratic nature when interacting with the crypto world could ultimately attract more people to it in the long run, even if for the wrong reasons, said Nurm.“Even though Musk is temporarily causing turmoil in the market, his involvement could be beneficial for crypto in the long-term, as he is attracting new people to crypto, albeit for sometimes the wrong reasons,” he said.Nurm referenced Musk’s newest cryptocurrency plaything: CumRocket (CUMMIES), a token supposedly created for use in the adult film industry, which quadrupled in price in the space of 10 minutes when Musk began tweeting about it.“His efforts to drive up the price of certain coins, like Dogecoin and more recently CumRocket, are potentially more dangerous as these apparent pump-and-dump schemes could leave many ordinary people out of pocket.”Related: Primal arrogance and greed: Elon Musk slammed for crypto manipulationA pinch of sodium chloride is needed when interpreting Musk’s tweets, said Nurm, who added that the billionaire CEO may have ulterior motives when he gives the thumbs up or thumbs down on a given coin.“I hope people take all of Musk’s crypto tweets and other comments with a pinch of salt — and they must remember he has ulterior motives,” Nurm ended.

It is a decentralized cryptocurrency, a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain. As per the founding team behind AINU, the whole idea of this AINU token is to create a community that will help other people as they invest. They added that following the footsteps of Vitalik Buterin they have donated 20% total token supply to ""India Crypto Covid Relief Fund"". AINU is a community-driven, social, charitable, and fair launch token. Holders of AINU earn passive rewards through a static reflection while watching their balance of AINU grow indefinitely. The total supply of the AINU token is pre-set to one quintillion, that is [1,000,000,000,000,000,000] $AINU, where 11% in team wallet is reserved for future burns/airdrops/listings/advertisement. 5% of each transaction is allocated to token holders, and 5% of each transaction goes to the Liquidity pool for sustainability. There is no involvement of mint or burn functions. However, users can send tokens to the burn address to act as a deflationary mechanism. The token contract provides full transparency and has been audited by Solidity Finance. AINU's code of conduct implements upon the fee-redistribution of the features pioneered by Reflect Finance. Users who hold AINU tokens will automatically receive a portion of the fees from each transfer made. In addition, a small fee is charged when transactions are stored in the contract, or the threshold value is met. Users can also fund PancakeSwap liquidity if they wish to do so. Liquidity ads were financed by selling half of the tokens collected as fees, pairing and receiving BNB with the receipts, and finally adding it as liquidity to the BNB pair. The permit recipient will be newly created as the LP tokens are the burn address to ensure that the LP tokens are safely locked and secured. The owner of the AINU tokens can not update the fee percentages and view their allocation in between distribution and liquidity ads as the developers have renounced ownership. None of the smart contract variables can be changed from their current state, and no additional addresses can be included or excluded from the charges. The contract utilizes SafeMath libraries to prevent overflows along with following the BEP20 standard. Until now, no security issues were identified in any analysis done. Like any other token, AINU ensures trust in the team before investing, as they have substantial control over the ecosystem regarding the token allocation. AINU is currently available for trading in AINU/BNB and AINU/USDT pairs on DEX, including Pancake Swap and IndoEX Exchange. Considering that AINU is listed on IndoEX Exchange market on the 10th day of its journey, In the future AINU plans to apply for listing on all major centralized exchanges as well, including Binance, Coinbase Global, Inc. etc. AINU recently Launched a Snake type prototype game for its token holders to have some fun. The developments are being monitored and thoroughly investigated for the game. The game is just a piece of sense of humor to the crypto world, considering the basic idea of supporting the community with the Covid fight. This fun game allows people to spend some fun time and, in turn, for some entertainment during these tough times.

Then when Musk tweeted that bitcoin wouldn’t be accepted and Tesla cited environmental concerns, the price dropped significantly. Sunday’s tweet boosted BTC prices by 9% and the price has inched past the psychological $40K region.  This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market. When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 13, 2021  Despite his good intentions, it’s difficult to predict how Musk will achieve his goal of determining whether the bitcoin mining ecosystem uses 50% clean energy. According to some studies, the goal may have already been achieved, as researchers have been looking into the number of miners who use renewables for quite some time.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609692 = window.pid609692 || rnd;                 var plc609692 = window.plc609692 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609692;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609692 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609692++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc476001 = window.plc476001 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc476001:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_476001_' + plc476001;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 476001,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_476001_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc476001++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609693 = window.pid609693 || rnd;                 var plc609693 = window.plc609693 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609693;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609693 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609693++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                  Musk might want to study Coinshares’ analysis from June 2019, which shows that renewable energy sources power 74.1 percent of the bitcoin mining industry. Additionally, Coinshares issued a survey on the same subject the year before, finding that renewable energy-dependent miners accounted for about 77.8% of all miners. No Definite Data Global asset manager Ark Invest Management explained in mid-May that concerns over the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption are “misguided.” Even John Lennon’s son detailed that Bitcoin’s use of energy was a silly argument compared to the carbon footprint that’s tied to consumerism                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  Well, it seems most critiques have been leveraging data derived from Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) and the index provided by digiconomist.net. Both metrics show large discrepancies (between each site) to this very day and in December 2020, Bitcoin.com News was told at the time the “CBECI map hasn’t been updated for some time now.” These discrepancies and the notation that data wasn’t (at least in December 2020) being updated regularly, could be problematic for analysts. The CBECI representative brought this inconsistency to light in the first place because the website claimed that China accounted for 65% of the hashrate. This statistic was challenged in July 2020, when Bitooda research revealed that China accounted for only 50% of global hashrate. Despite the rising hashrate in North America and the purchase of thousands of mining rigs by Western countries over the last six months, CBECI data shows that China still holds 65.08 percent of the BTC hashrate on June 14, 2021. According to pool statistics, Foundry USA has been capturing a lot of hashrate recently, capturing 4.3 percent of global hashrate on Monday. Bitcoin Mining Council May Open Leeway Meanwhile, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor has been tweeting about the Bitcoin Mining Council, announcing that the organization will meet this week on Wednesday. Despite the noble intentions behind this concept, many people are in doubt and question whether it even matters. “On Wednesday, you are all invited to meet with members of the Bitcoin Mining Council to discuss the latest on bitcoin Mining, the energy debate, network dynamics, China mining policy, North American mining developments, tech trends &amp; industry outlook,” Saylor tweeted. North America may account for 10% to 15% of global hashrate, but that is insignificant when compared to the vast majority of miners worldwide. However, the newest crackdown news from Beijing may force the worldwide mining industry to switch to renewable energy anyhow. BTC/USD has broken the $40k psychological barrier.

Sweden, with its distinctively low use of cash is a natural forerunner but other regions have recently made headway, too.Notably, the European Central Bank is powering ahead on the digital currency dossier. It not only completed a public consultation on the digital euro, but also a consultation with the European Parliament and made known its plans to start a formal investigation into an e-euro in mid-2021.Debunking CBDCsCBDCs – a frequently obscure concept that gets lumped in with cryptocurrencies – are a digital representation of central bank-issued cash. CBDCs can use an electronic record or digital token to represent the virtual form of a fiat currency in a country/region, backed by monetary reserves.By their nature, CBDC are centralised, issued by a central bank or akin monetary authority. This contrasts with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which capitalise on the distributed ledger technology known as blockchain and are inherently decentralised and unregulated.CBDCs strive to combine the technological prowess of crypto, and bring the convenience of the regulated, reserve-backed money circulation of the traditional banking system to an ordinary citizen.Central bankers’ response to cryptoThe dynamic progress in the public domain owes to the loss of control over the growth and influence of cryptocurrencies. The starting point can be traced back to Facebook’s 2019 plan to launch its own stable coin, Libra.This was quickly met by an intense pushback from regulators and authorities, ranging from the European Data Protection Supervisor to China’s recent regulatory clampdown on payment channels and consumption data.The rise of cryptocurrencies unleashed a wave of unforeseen financial innovation in the public space. Regulators were quick to neutralise the perceived threat they pose to the institution of monetary sovereignty.However the onset of the pandemic, with heightened appetite for e-commerce everywhere and greater demand for cashless payments, has provided added impetus for potential CBDC adoption and a means to reign in national monetary control.Ambiguous gainsOne of the key challenges central banks could be faced with in the uptake of digital currencies is the disruptive impact they would have on traditional banking systems. Digital currencies open the gates for any tech company to become a de facto ""bank"" (wholesale CBDC) or even sidestep traditional commercial banking completely (retail CBDC). The latter case could yield an unwelcome macroeconomic consequence: if citizens shift a share of deposits to central banks to open e-euro accounts, commercial banks loose resources used to intermediate and finance growth via issuing loans.This is especially peculiar in the eurozone, where capital markets are shallow and fragmented, and a large chunk of growth is financed via the banking system. Whole CBDC could, thus, be the preferred option that preserves the role of commercial banks as lenders.Some of its (CBDC) features, such as the built-in programmability for transactions and smart contracts could be regulators’ biggest launchpad into the digital economy.The second challenge concerns the data privacy realm, which makes policymakers and citizens alike wary. If the e-euro is to emulate cash, it should be anonymous. But if users open up e-euro accounts with central banks, the anonymity property will go amiss. Besides, leading voices have articulated doubts over purely token-based CBDCs (without identity), citing ""big concerns around money laundering, the financing of terrorism and tax evasion"".In Europe – which has to-date showed the world the way on the data privacy regulation – privacy remains a top priority for citizens and finance professionals, as per the ECB public consultation on e-euro. The survey results make a case in point on the inherent tradeoff between CBDCs anonymity and operability. But demographics and geography may also play a role in a large scheme of things, whereby millennials and some regions, such as Asia, are less concerned about privacy issues in favour of convenience.Then there is the debate on the benefit ‘greater currency internationalisation’, which includes having its currency vastly used by non-residents, through the adoption of its digital equivalent. But if all major central banks unfold their own digital currency representations, will it not be just a zero-sum-game in the global landscape?In Europe, consistent incremental progress on the Capital Markets Union, and breakthroughs, such as risk mutualisation as a part of the new EU Generation Next pandemic rescue package, may do the internationalisation of the euro more justice than rolling out its digital equivalent.Sona Muzikarova Chief Economist | Head of Economic Growth & Sustainability Programriso@zweng.sk/Photo Studio ZwengRegulators’ launchpad into the digital economySo if CBDCs would not likely provide the anonymity of cash, could severely disrupt the existing banking system, and would not help with currency ""internationalisation"", why are central banks going through the trouble of pursuing them, apart from the effort to keep up with digital transformation and protect their status of monetary authority?Some of the features of CBDCs, such as the built-in programmability for transactions and smart contracts could be regulators’ biggest launchpad into the digital economy. Imagine a programmable policy support that targets, with precision, specific public services, or structural areas in the economy with timing cap, and with almost real-time feedback.The same feature, however, makes innovations, such as reversibility of transactions or bank account balance expiration dates controversial. Even here, uneasy technological and ethical choices must be made to reap the benefits.ADVERTISEMENTWith the advent of CBDCs, fintech and money is having its own atom-splitting moment. But with key benefits for citizens and economies obscure, and key technology and privacy questions unresolved, it, for now, remains a bold attempt of central bankers to remain in the driver’s seat in an era of new ideas and possibilities.About the authors: Oscar Sanz-Paris is Managing Principal at Castille Capital, Sona Muzikarova is a Chief Economist at GLOBSEC, a leading central European think-tank; Juraj Somora is cryptocurrency research lead at GLOBSEC.",2021-06-15

That’s according to the results of a Q2 retail investment survey conducted by crypto firm Voyager Digital, which polled 3,671 high-frequency traders on the Voyager platform. The survey’s findings revealed that 81% of respondents are more confident in the future of cryptocurrency, even after the violent price crash in April and May, which saw Bitcoin and others lose more than 50% of their value.Many coins have since recovered significantly, although the market still remains uncertain. Despite this, 87% of the survey’s respondents said they plan to increase their crypto holdings over the next quarter — an increase on the 80% who said the same in Q1. Some 39% of respondents said they expected the Bitcoin price to have fallen between $56,000 and $70,000 by the end of Q3 2021, while 28% predicted a Bitcoin price between $41,000 and $55,000. The percentage of respondents who believed Bitcoin would reach a price of $71,000 stood at 18%, down from the previous survey’s figure of 20%.Notably, more than nine out of 10 of those polled said they thought the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would eventually approve a Bitcoin ETF — an exchange-traded fund that crypto proponents believe will boost the value of Bitcoin through exposing it to institutional investment.Among the altcoins that respondents said they were most bullish on, Cardano (ADA) turned out to be the most popular. Some 55% said they were bullish on Cardano above any other altcoin, with Dogecoin (DOGE) coming in second (11%), followed by Chainlink’s LINK (6%) and Polkadot’s DOT (6%).Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich said it was encouraging to see continued faith in the cryptocurrency market despite the recent crash. Ehrlich suggested the results of the survey indicate that most investors view the recent market dip as a buying opportunity rather than a portent of worse to come.“The fact that the vast majority of our large sample size of investors are more confident in the future of cryptocurrency shows how people see May’s volatility in many crypto assets as a buying opportunity,” said Ehrlich.“Our findings show that 87% of investors are looking to increase their crypto holdings in the next quarter, a much higher percentage compared to the last survey we conducted in April,” he added.

In 2019, transfers using traditional money totalled nearly $6 billion (roughly Rs. 43,970 crores) - around a fifth of GDP - one of the highest ratios in the world, according to the World Bank.The sharp increase in Bitcoin transfers mirrors trends across Central America, the data showed, one of the first glimpses of crypto use in El Salvador.

Some 95 percent come from Salvadorans working in the United States, it said.Bitcoin, in theory, offers a quick and cheap way to send money across borders without relying on traditional and often costly remittance channels. Yet its relative complexity and lack of infrastructure for converting to dollars is widely seen as hampering its use.While El Salvador sees Bitcoin as a useful way for citizens overseas to send funds home, major remittance firms are cautious about offering cryptocurrency services.Separately, ratings agency Moody's said on Friday that El Salvador's Bitcoin law may imperil a deal on a funding programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The move ""carries risks for the financial system, the stability of the country's monetary regime and signals a lack of a coherent economic framework,"" Moody's said.The IMF warned on Thursday it had economic and legal concerns over El Salvador's law, widening spreads on the country's bonds.© Thomson Reuters 2021Interested in cryptocurrency?

At time of writing, the price of cryptocurrencies has crashed by almost $1.3 trillion, with   Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, losing almost half of its value in April. Despite some investors buying at the dip, it has not recovered. The case of Gamestop’s stock ($GME) early in the year showed that ‘traders’ on smart phone apps could shake   the core of the financial world. Despite this, more people than ever are hoping to strike it rich investing in cryptocurrencies, trading currency or buying stocks online, and wherever there is money changing hands there are people looking to take it. Cryptocurrency exchanges have been hit   particularly hard by fraud, with   $12.6 billion stolen since 2011 (adjusted for inflation). The average value of a hack on a crypto exchange is $24 million, making them extremely lucrative. Although there are supposedly    ‘major flaws’ in the security of desktop and app-based trading apps, they are not the targets of nearly as many hacking attempts, though low-level fraud like multi-accounting to get sign-up bonuses is still an issue. We found out from experience that digital fraud in online trading, particularly in the crypto space, needs more active security, and machine learning (ML) was the only way to create security protocols that work as fast and efficiently as modern fraudsters. Fraud and money laundering in crypto, stocks and FOREX Multi-million dollar hacks of exchanges will make the news, but for fraud and compliance professionals working in online trading, particularly in crypto, every day means putting out fires and wondering whether the fraud attempts you prevented are only the   tip of the iceberg. Multi-accounting, the practice of opening multiple accounts to either get sign-up bonuses or move funds between accounts for the purpose of money laundering (which we’ll discuss later) is always going to be prevalent on online trading platforms. Although   they are rare in crypto, many FOREX trading sites offer free trades as a sign-up bonus and it can potentially be lucrative to create accounts en masse to harvest them. Account takeover is similarly common, and rarely discussed in the press. In stock and FOREX trading platforms an account takeover is relatively simple: find an account’s login details, change their payment details to that of a bank account that you can use   but which cannot be traced to you, then empty their account. With cryptocurrency exchanges this is more complicated since, theoretically, every transaction can be traced through the blockchain that underpins the technology and simply ‘cashing out’ one’s holdings   is usually more complicated and time-consuming than it is on fiat-currency based platforms. However, it still happens. There are less-used altcoins that make traceability much more difficult, and proceeds from account takeovers can be laundered through them to get rid of any traces of their origin before being returned to more easily used currencies.   Although the use of cryptocurrency for actual purchases is becoming rare as it becomes seen as more of a speculative asset than a currency, there are still online retailers who will accept it as payment, allowing criminals to convert their gains into re-sellable   goods, and dark web markets like the Russian site Hydra that would allow stolen cryptocurrency to be converted into narcotics, gift vouchers, pre-paid credit cards or just cash through specialised money launderers. Hot and cold security Despite its reputation as the ‘wild west’ of financial assets, cryptocurrency is becoming more legitimate by the day, with more and more exchanges utilising Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, two-factor authentication for logins and bank-grade security   protecting their servers. Sophisticated and security-conscious users are increasingly moving to keep their coins in places other than on major trading apps, such as    ‘cold’ wallets and even USB keys. In security terms, a ‘hot wallet’ is an account on an internet-connected device, such as the servers powering cryptocurrency exchanges. Being connected to the internet, it can be hacked, and since cryptocurrency exchanges don’t provide the same insurance   as banks, in the event of a hack a trader could potentially lose everything. Some exchanges will work to compensate customers in the event of a major security breach, but they are not obligated to, and some will simply lack the funds to do so in the event   of a multi-million dollar loss. However, in some ways, cryptocurrency could be seen as even safer than traditional stock trading and FOREX sites – if you were to buy a stock, for instance, you would have to continue to have a ‘hot’ online account with a trading site, which could be hacked.   If you cashed out your account, you wouldn’t be able to benefit from any growth of that particular stock. In the cryptocurrency space, ‘cold’ wallets exist that are not connected to the internet, storing an individual private key on a USB stick or even a paper   print-out rather than allowing access to an account through much more easily hackable usernames and passwords. The benefit here is that even when stored in a cold wallet, one bitcoin is still one bitcoin, and can grow accordingly until such time as you want   to trade it or convert it to fiat currency. If anything, the security on these cold wallets can prove to be too good, causing users to lose thousands or even millions because of    lost passwords. Balancing ease of use and safety While in the previous decade the technical challenge of setting up a cryptocurrency wallet and the sheer difficulty of trading equities and foreign currency online (or at least doing so profitably) kept many people out of potentially risky online trading.   This is no longer the case – even as recently as earlier this year the Gamestop affair showed millions of people that there was potential for incredible profits from easily available apps, and even before that black swan event online brokers were already    seeing huge growth as US citizens invested their stimulus cheques. The record-breaking price of bitcoin caused similar growth in cryptocurrency investments, though because of the nature of the crypto space it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to know how   many individuals own cryptocurrency (though there are   some estimates). As cryptocurrency becomes more commonly accepted and trading stocks and FOREX online continue to grow security and compliance measures will of course become standardised, but so will the number of unsophisticated users and fraudsters looking to exploit them.   While the massive hacks of exchanges are conducted by highly sophisticated groups and may be impossible to fully prevent, the equally damaging but less headline-worthy daily account hijackings and multi-accounting scams tend to operate on a ‘quantity, not   quality’ basis, firing off hundreds or thousands of attempts and hoping that some stick. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled fraud prevention allows the companies behind online trading platforms to keep up with the sheer quantity of attacks. Machine learning   allows systems to keep themselves up to date with the ways in which fraudsters are trying to access accounts, and for the secure sharing of huge amounts of data from companies around the world to make anti-fraud systems even more powerful. Modern trading platforms need modern fraud solutions, and the only solution that can keep up with fraud on the scale and level of sophistication of the fraud problem that they experience is equally sophisticated artificial intelligence. By using the very   latest technology it is fully possible for companies in the crypto, FOREX and online stock trading field to balance growth, ease of use and safety. ",2021-06-15

So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have said rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time. Recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal. ""Assuming that some of the recent increase in inflation is indeed sustained, we would argue that the Fed will react to it, supporting the USD later this year,"" analysts at BofA Global Research said in note.

Bitcoin climbs near $40,000 after Musk says Tesla could use it again from      technology    Bitcoin climbed over $40,000 on Monday following a series of tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk who said Tesla sold bitcoin but may begin using it again. Last month, Musk tweeted that Tesla will halt the use of bitcoin due to environmental concerns. But over the weekend, he said Tesla will resume the use of bitcoin once there is confirmation of clean energy usage by miners with a positive trend for the future. This caused bitcoin to jump by 20 per cent on Sunday, and on Monday it had increased even more by four per cent. Musk has a huge influence on bitcoin which has caused some controversy as bitcoin prices seem to fluctuate depending on his stance which he usually shares on Twitter. [Reuters] Ontario residents looking to book their second dose vaccines Monday morning suffered major frustration after the provincial booking system showed numerous technical issues. Several residents took to Twitter to share their experiences. Many people reported having to wait for over an hour and then being told there were no available appointments in their area. Some experienced the system giving them options to book at locations one to two hours away from their home. Others were told after waiting that the system was down and could not complete the booking process.   Microsoft employees slept in data centers during pandemic lockdown, exec says from      technology    And lastly, a story about how during the height of the pandemic, Microsoft employees slept in the software’s data company centres has caught fire. The majority of tech employees were told to work from home when the pandemic first hit. But a few of the Microsoft employees who worked at locations containing servers for online services like Teams and public-cloud infrastructures decided to stay and work on site. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not reveal where exactly the employees slept, as data centres can be dangerous to sleep in due to the heat coming off of servers. The company did however offer busses that transported employees to data centres and even allowed some to stay in hotels depending on shifts. [CNBC] That’s all the tech news that’s trending right now.

It is a decentralized platform that traders can use to limit their risk exposure in case the value of an asset goes down.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609692 = window.pid609692 || rnd;                 var plc609692 = window.plc609692 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609692;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609692 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609692++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc476001 = window.plc476001 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc476001:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_476001_' + plc476001;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 476001,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_476001_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc476001++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609693 = window.pid609693 || rnd;                 var plc609693 = window.plc609693 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609693;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609693 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609693++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                  Dual Trading Options on Hedget Hedget provides basically two options for traders to utilize on the platform. The call option and the put option. The former is utilized when the trader wishes to go long while the latter is utilized when the trader wishes to go short or benefit from the drop in value of an asset. How Both Options Work A trader buys the call option with a projection that the price will increase at an expected date in the future. On the other hand, a projected drop in price will make a trader buy the put option.                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  For example, imagine Cindy and John, two traders who wish to make profits from the fall in the price of bitcoin. Cindy brings her collateral in the form of BTC to the contract while John buys her option. When BTC is $40000, Cindy deposited 35000 USDT in the contract to create a put option at $35000 per BTC. So in other words Cindy instead of buying BTC right away want to buy it cheaper later. Cindy set her contract to expire in one week. Cindy also puts a price tag of $1000 on the option. John is another trader. He projects that the value of BTC will decrease in the coming month, so John purchased Cindy’s put option at the tag of $1000. After one week, BTC’s price decreased to $30000 and John decided to trigger the put option. He may decide to take his profit. John’s profit is the difference between the strike price and the current price of the asset. That is $35000 – $30000 = $5000. Additionally, we will factor in the cost of the contract to calculate John’s net profit. That will be $35000 – $30000 – $1000 = $4000. Cindy’s loss on the other hand will be $30000 – $35000 + $1000 = $4000. But nevertheless, Cindy got her BTC cheaper than it was when she created her put option. After the cash gain or physical asset gain is settled, the position is closed. John and Cindy made gains from the drop in the price of Bitcoin. This simple example illustrates how traders can make gains from the price dip of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The Options Trading Model on Hedget Options trading on Hedget allows traders to buy or sell an asset with a future date in mind. While some platforms already have this feature, Hedget stands out because it is decentralized. Other platforms that permit hedging are centralized. Centralization does not sync with the blockchain and DeFi ecosystem. Hedget has internal smart contract option accounts. Users must provide complete collateral for an option to be created. This may reduce subsequently as Hedget gains more traction. Stablecoins will be featured as pricing options. Conclusion The DeFi ecosystem requires lots of innovations and inventions. This innovation serves as a decentralized hedge for traders and it shields lending protocols from liquidation. These features are highly needed in the DeFi space. As such, we can project that Hedget will play a key role in the DeFi revolution and more crypto users will utilize the platform to reduce their trading risks sooner or later.   Image: Pixabay ",2021-06-15

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 0.9% loss over the past four weeks.The increase in share price can be attributed to the announcement of completion of senior notes offering worth $500 million by the company. The notes carry interest at an annual rate of 6.125% and are slated for maturity in 2028.The net proceeds, after subtracting estimated offering expenses payable by the company and initial purchaser discounts & commissions, are expected to be around $488 million. The net proceeds are intended to be utilized for purchase of bitcoin.On the same day, MicroStrategy also filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  that includes a prospectus that allows the company to offer, issue and sell up to $1 billion worth of class A shares of the company. The net proceeds will be utilized for general corporate purposes which also includes additional purchase of bitcoin, as noted in the SEC filing.MicroStrategy has doubled down on increasing its bitcoin reserve. The company’s CEO Michael J. Saylor has constantly underscored that the company believes bitcoin can “serve as a dependable store of value.”Further, the company believes that its strategy of acquiring more bitcoins is complementary to its enterprise analytics software business. The company is of the idea that its bitcoin related activities will put spotlight on its brand and in turn, attract new clients for its software business.This business software company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +128.6%. Revenues are expected to be $119.95 million, up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Story continuesFor MicroStrategy, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

Investors will debate endlessly regarding whether a stock is overvalued, whether bond yields make sense for the current environment, to what extent oil will be used two decades in the future, and so forth. But few asset classes are quite as controversial as gold, bitcoin, and other alternative monies. Some people literally put every penny they have into them and trust nothing else, while other people canât possibly see why they hold any value at all. Others like me simply incorporate them into parts of a portfolio mix. Since they are not cashflow-producing businesses or industrial commodities with analyzable supply and demand balances, the bull/bear gap is unusually wide when it comes to valuing things like gold or bitcoin, not just in terms of price but in terms of the very purpose for their existence as investable assets. Some people love them and will happily dollar cost average into 50% price crashes, while others dismiss them as yellow rocks and magical internet money and maintain zero position in the assets under any context. And yet, it was illegal for Americans to own gold for about 40 years, from the mid-1930s to the mid-1970s. In some places today, itâs illegal to own bitcoin. Governments sometimes find them to be dangerous. How could something so useless, also be so dangerous? Useless things rarely get banned, and instead can be safely ignored as they work their way towards oblivion over time. This article attempts to shed light on their popularity. So, rather than focusing on specific price forecasts in this article, Iâll be analyzing the reasons behind their use. If youâve never held gold or bitcoin and donât quite get what all the fuss is about, consider this your Rosetta Stone to understand why many people do value them. From there, we can then determine in what economic environments their price is likely to go up or go down from an investment perspective, to see how they can be useful in the context of a diversified portfolio. The Concept of Self-Custody is Rare There are remarkably few financial assets in the world that you can hold for a long time without trusting a centralized counterparty to hold it for you. The vast majority of assets, like stocks and bonds and cash accounts, are held by financial institutions on your behalf or rely on centralized databases listing you as an asset owner. Real estate is the biggest asset class that you self-custody (in a manner of speaking), but itâs not portable or liquid or fungible. Collectibles are often a self-custodied form of asset, but theyâre not very fungible or liquid, meaning that each individual unit has various quirks such as date, condition, or type that make it hard to exchange for other goods or services. The same is true for gems. That leaves physical cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies as the only asset classes that can be self-custodied and traded with others without a trusted/centralized third party, while also being sufficiently liquid, fungible, and portable. In other words, they are among a small number of money-like bearer assets. If you think about it, itâs actually really hard to invent a money-like asset that derives value from itself. If you and me want to exchange fungible value in any arbitrary amount without a third party, online or offline, there are remarkably few ways to do it. Usually we donât particularly want to do that so itâs not a problem (weâre fine with a third-party involved, like a credit card transaction), but if we think about how we would do that if we wanted to, there are surprisingly few options. Just about any mechanism that we can exchange value with, in a way that is liquid and fungible, requires processing/verification by a centralized third party, and that third party can spy on the transaction or block the transaction. Physical cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies are the exceptions, where they can be both held and transacted with outside of any centralized third party custodian or verifier. Physical Cash: Pros and Cons Physical cash depreciates in value over time. Policymakers around the world target a positive inflation rate, often 2% or higher, and the amount of fiat currency in existence grows over time. The word âfiatâ means an authoritative declaration. Fiat currency is just paper or bits of information with no inherent value or supply caps, and thus is not something that usually self-organizes towards usage. It requires the government to mandate its use by force, which means by taxing other asset transactions, making taxes payable only in their government-issued currency, and in some cases implementing capital controls or banning competitor assets to their currency. An exception to the rule that fiat currencies tend not to self-organize, would be that in various developing countries with particularly weak currencies, dollars or euros are sometimes traded in black markets or out in the open, and are considered a relatively hard form of money compared to the local alternatives. An example of a developing market currency that historically has issues, is the Egyptian pound. Egyptians saw their cash savings lose half of its value against the dollar or euro practically overnight in November 2016, whether it was held in a bank or not. And thatâs a country with 100 million people.  Over the past century, the strongest currencies, like the Swiss franc and US dollar, lost over 95% of their value. The average currency lost more than that, like around 98-99%. The worst currencies lost 100% of their value. Even in a less extreme and more recent environment, the dollar lost about 40% of its value against official consumer price inflation since the year 2000. The only way to counteract that is to hold cash with a bank to earn interest, and thus involve a counterparty. In particularly inflationary decades, the interest often isnât enough to keep up with inflation. This chart shows T-bill interest rates minus the official CPI inflation rate since the 1930s; whenever itâs below zero it means T-bills (and by extension bank cash accounts that generally have similar rates) arenât keeping up with inflation even when earning a yield.  And for longer-term savings instruments, here is a chart of the inflation-adjusted forward annualized rate of return of buying 10-year Treasury notes that year and holding them to maturity. You can see the three decades where bondholders got massacred, because the underlying dollars were devalued. During those times, anyone who bought Treasuries and held to maturity received annualized real returns of as low as -4% or -5% during the full duration of the note.  So, cash is useful as a medium of exchange and less-so as a store of value. Itâs something we hold as working capital that we can usually expect to be reasonably stable a few years out (at least in developed countries), but not something that can be considered a long-term store of value outside of the financial system, and sometimes not even within the financial system. Plus, the current iteration of fiat-only currencies is actually only about five decades old, as it became the norm in 1971. Itâs a surprisingly recent system even though we take it for granted today. And technically, cash does rely on a trusted/centralized third party (the government). Itâs just that the trusted/centralized third party doesnât need to be present for transactions to occur, and doesnât need to hold it for you. As a bearer asset, cash can be self-custodied and exchanged with other people offline, with no direct counterparty. Precious Metals: Pros and Cons  Gold and silver are the longest-running fungible stores of value, stretching back thousands of years on multiple continents. Since gold is nearly chemically indestructible and can be re-melted and re-forged any number of times, it basically lasts forever. Unlike industrial commodities that are regularly consumed, gold has a high stock-to-flow ratio, meaning that its supply/demand characteristics are more like a currency than a commodity. Since it is extremely malleable, it is easy to work into standardized coins or bars. And itâs shiny and resistant to most forms of degradation, which makes it ideal for jewelry. There was a History Channel documentary a while back called âLife After Peopleâ that visualized what would happen to the cities and stuff we left behind if humans suddenly vanished. It basically tracks the decay process until everything we built turns to ruins, crumbling and rusting away. One of the few things that would last hundreds of thousands of years without changing, would be our vaulted gold. The gold vault stored under the New York Fed, for example, would be filled with water and long-buried, but the gold bars would be the same after a bit of cleaning. Itâs hard to find big and accessible earth deposits of it, and it requires processing many tons of rock to get a tiny amount of gold, so only about 1.5%-2.0% gold is dug up each year as a percentage of the current amount that is estimated to exist above-ground. Gold has a 1.5%-2.0% average annual monetary inflation rate, in other words. This has historically been about the same rate as world population growth, so the amount of gold per capita has been pretty consistent over time. A 1-ounce gold coin could buy you a top-notch outfit a century ago, and can buy you a top-notch outfit today. No more, no less. Based on estimates by the World Gold Council, there is only around one ounce of above-ground gold per person in the world. If you stick physical cash somewhere and come back to it decades later, it will have lost most of its purchasing power. In contrast, if you stick physical gold somewhere and come back to it decades later, chances are it will have retained most or all of its purchasing power, unless you bought right at the top of a rare gold bubble like in 1980 or 2011. However, in any given 5-year or 10-year period, it could easily lose or gain 25%+ of its purchasing power. Additionally, gold is subject to taxes when sold, and in the physical market is usually bought at a premium to spot and sold at a discount to spot, since the middlemen need to earn a profit to make a liquid market. So, itâs not great for everyday use, unless countries decide to peg their currencies to it. Itâs best used as a long-term store of value. There are debit cards that can be linked to gold accounts to make it a medium of exchange, but that introduces a trusted/centralized counterparty. Plus, itâs risky to hold a lot of gold in self-custody due to the risk of theft. Vaulting services can safely hold larger amounts of gold, but this ironically centralizes it, and over the past century, most countries went through one or more periods of gold confiscation where vaulted gold was taken from the owner. There are very few jurisdictions in the world where someone could have vaulted gold with a third party a century ago and successfully passed it to their grandchildren, for example. Silver and platinum are similar to gold as self-custodied stores of value, but they are more of a hybrid between currencies and commodities, and as such have lower stock-to-flow ratios and more volatility. Platinum also tends to have less liquidity and bigger frictional costs when physically bought and sold. Overall, gold is a better long-term self-custodied asset than cash. Many wealthy people retain a small amount of it for disaster insurance. Cryptocurrencies: Pros and Cons In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto put together a number of existing technologies, with his own innovations added to the mix, to create the concept of digital scarcity. There were a number of predecessors that solved parts of the problem, but this was the first one that put enough pieces together to become a big success. Bitcoin is an open source decentralized public ledger, with a built-in incentive mechanism for miners across the distributed network to verify transactions in exchange for fees and block subsidies, where people use a set of public and private keys to transact without a centralized third party. There are also thousands of nodes, that anyone with a normal computer and internet connection can run, to verify the network and push back against various types of miner collusion. Kind of like fiat currencies, each individual bitcoin or fraction of a bitcoin has no industrial use outside of the potential payment and store of value properties that it has. Bitcoin is just a ledger, keeping track of values assigned to different addresses, and your private key entitles you to control the coins associated with that address. There are deeper technical nuances like UTXOs, but thatâs the basic idea. You can self-custody your private key on paper, on a hardware wallet, stamped on a titanium plate, or memorized in your head with a seed phrase. You can even split your key into several parts and hold each part in different ways in different locations. However, unlike fiat currencies, there is no central authority that can change the Bitcoin networkâs monetary policy, issue more bitcoin, block transactions, or take bitcoin from an address. Bitcoin is digitally native, unlike gold and cash. Gold and cash can only be transacted with offline, unless they are willing to rely on a trusted/centralized third party (at which point they lose the property of being self-custodied and censorship-resistant). Bitcoin can do that online and across borders. Itâs a digitally-native money-like bearer asset. Thatâs why itâs so polarizing. At first glance, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seem silly and without intrinsic use. But when you go down the list of attributes and compare bitcoin to fiat currencies, it is better in most ways other than volatility. It has no industrial use, but the simple concept of a wide network effect of uncensorable transactions wrapped around its strict monetary policy with no leader, makes it an interesting form of global internet money that has rapidly grown in value since inception. It reached 100 million users faster than the internet or smartphone usage did, and became the fastest asset in history to touch a $1 trillion USD market capitalization from inception.  There are even small custom USB sticks that hold bitcoin and have to be destroyed to be spent. They can be passed around like large-denomination dollar bills physically, and eventually put back online when spent. Theyâre physical bearer assets.  Image Source: OPENDIME In a May 2021 interview, Ross Stevens, the executive chairman of NYDIG, which partners with institutions for bitcoin-related services, spoke about Bitcoinâs use-case:    Nothing beyond a store of value is necessary for Bitcoin to be extraordinarily valuable for the world. Having said that, for the first time in history, we have an electronic bearer asset, never had one of those before. Itâs called Bitcoin. And we have an open source monetary network; weâve never had one of those before either. Itâs also called Bitcoin. That together can achieve cash finality, meaning final settlement anywhere in the world, anytime, any day, 24/7 365, liquidity in any currency pair you care about. So let me explain the mechanics. You think about the base of layer of cash, think about US dollars the base layer, like I can give it to you, you can give it to me, thereâs no other- that *is* the settlement, that is final settlement. If I write you check, thatâs a second layer solution, or a credit card might be third layer solution, so there are more and more abstractions of money on the base layer of cash. Bitcoin the asset is the base layer. Thereâs something called Lightning, which is a second layer solution. Think of it like a check but it can move at light speed. And so an example of the mechanics are, I can today in New York turn my US dollars into bitcoin, I can move it up to the Lightning network and this is all in milliseconds, I can zip them anywhere in the world on Lightning network at light speed, they receive that wherever it is in the world and can do an FX trade of bitcoin into dollars if the receiver wants to receive dollars (editor note: or euros, or yen, or anything else). So what has happened is, youâve moved fiat over Bitcoin rails, so itâs a fiat to fiat transaction, youâve done it instantly and for free but for a tiny bid/ask spread on the FX trade. Thereâs no merchant fee, thereâs no interchange fee, thereâs no fees. Itâs a different set of rails; itâs a totally new set of rails, instantly and for free. [â¦] And a great example of this, and this is not a game this is serious, this is life or death, is whatâs going on in El Salvador. So Strike, Jack Mallersâ firm, what theyâre allowing people from the US who want to give remittances to people in El Salvador- I donât know if you know this but 24% of the GDP in El Salvador is remittances. Mexico is 4% to put it into perspective. So a housekeeper in New York sends a hundred dollars to her sister in El Salvador. Before Strike and before Lightning, the way that transaction worked, they would go through Western Union, the sister would go to Western Union in El Salvador, a hundred dollars would turn into sixty (editor note: due to fees, which vary but are quite high in percent terms on most remittances), the sister would have to be fearful of gangs hanging outside the Western Union. And what a lot of people donât realize is there arenât a lot of Western Unions in El Salvador, so the sister might have to drive hours on a bus, to get the sixty. Now fast forward to today, what has Strike done with Lightning Labs? That sister takes her hundred dollars in a Strike app, buys (fractional) bitcoin, that bitcoin zips to El Salvador across the Lightning network, her sister gets it in El Salvador, does an FX trade instantly and for free. So a hundred dollars doesnât turn into sixty; it turns into 99.8 dollars. Thereâs no trip to Western Union to battle the gangs. Thereâs no hours of bus and taking that day out of your life every single week just to survive. And 6-8 weeks ago there were 10-15 signups per day. Thereâs 15,000-20,000 signups a day now. It is changing lives every single day. -Ross Stevens, May 2021  Indeed, Strike became one of the most-downloaded apps in El Salvador in the initial weeks of being released. And then even more notably, a couple weeks after that interview, El Salvador passed a law making bitcoin legal tender in the country. This means that transactions are not taxable and merchants have to accept bitcoin for payment if possible. I spoke with Elizabeth Stark, the CEO and co-founder of Lightning Labs at the 2021 Bitcoin Conference (users can find the video by Googling the title of the video ""Bitcoin 2021: Bitcoin For Billions, Not Billionaires"") about the Bitcoin networkâs use-cases in emerging markets on June 5th, and about four hours later during the capstone speech of the afternoon by Jack Mallers, the president of El Salvador made that surprise announcement. The biggest risk for the Bitcoin network since inception is that, ever since Satoshi put all the tech pieces together to make this concept work, there are thousands of copied and altered cryptocurrencies that compete with the original Bitcoin. By existing and attracting buyers, these other coins threaten to undermine the supply limit, since although bitcoin itself is limited, if people buy into tons of cryptocurrencies, the whole space becomes very diluted. Itâs fine for there to be a handful of other viable blockchains, such as smart contract platforms and such, but when there is a huge number of competing protocols, it creates a diluted mess. But the fact that this mess exists is an inherit risk of the Bitcoin network; thereâs no way to block someone from copying the open-source distributed software and creating their own version. Their copied version isnât bitcoin, since it isnât recognized by Bitcoinâs node network. Similarly, if I copy the text of Wikipedia, I still canât copy the millions of links from websites around the internet pointing to the real Wikipedia, and canât bring over the countless individuals that continually update the real Wikipedia to update my version instead, and thus I canât copy its network effect. However, if enough variant copies exist and drain traffic from the real Wikipedia towards themselves, it could theoretically dilute the concept over time. Bitcoin has dealt with this threat from altcoins for 12.5 years, and it remains an ongoing risk. For the Bitcoin network to succeed, it needs to maintain a robust network effect against competitors over the long run, through the course of multiple bull/bear crypto cycles. A powerful country can enforce the use of its fiat currency, and gold has no major competition by other atomic elements for the properties of money. Bitcoin, on the other hand, must maintain market share by the quality of its own properties and userbase against competition, via first mover advantage and the resulting path-dependent network effects and security advantages that come from being first and biggest. Specifically, other cryptocurrencies can copy the Bitcoin networkâs code and run a similar ledger, but without the massive hash rate and node network, their copied protocol would be orders of magnitude less secure than the real one and thus they donât tend to catch on for long periods of time. Most of the coins that came in Bitcoinâs wake ended up being too centralized, where a rather small number of individuals have the capacity to change its monetary policy, and itâs hard for individual users to run a full node and verify the entire money supply because they make technical trade-offs that require large amounts of bandwidth or data storage to process. Most of them are easier to do a 51% attack on as well. Some people consider the Bitcoin network to be old technology already and propose that one or more altcoins will inevitably surpass it, but keep in mind that the internet still runs on TCP/IP, which is five decade old technology, and with no end in sight for its usage. Similarly, the USB protocol has been around for nearly three decades now and going strong, and it continues to be upgraded with new versions that double the speed each time and tend to be backward compatible with older versions. When the purpose of something is to be decentralized and robust with a wide network effect, simple slow-changing technology that earns a wide network effect is optimal. That doesnât mean a protocol can never be displaced, but once it hits critical mass, itâs quite a challenge to do so. More complex technologies can be built on top of those protocols to expand their use. Similarly, the Bitcoin base layer gets updated slowly (the latest update in progress is a privacy and multi-signature update called Taproot), and there is faster development on the secondary Lightning network layer, and even more development in the broad ecosystem of apps and services and hardware wallets that utilize the base layer and/or the secondary layer. Bitcoinâs base layer is purposely lightweight and is designed in such a way that even decades from now as the blockchain grows (assuming it exists and is successful), anyone should still be able to run a full node. So, each of the three types of self-custodied assets of cash, gold, and bitcoin has pros and cons. That doesnât mean theyâre all equal, but it means that each of the three categories has certain strengths and weaknesses, and will attract different types of users, and/or will attract the same users but in different types of environments. Why Self-Custody? Who Cares? Weâve established how rare it is for an asset to be able to be personally held and transacted with, without relying on a trusted/centralized third party, while also being liquid, fungible, and portable. Government paper, rare long-lasting elements, and digitally-scarce networks with sufficient scale to keep away copycats, are the main three. Gold is thousands of years old, the current fiat version of the US dollar is about 50 years old, and bitcoin is about 12.5 years old. In other words, this is money that references itself for its own value; something that two strangers on a street could transact with, even if they donât want any of the same things as each other, which rules out barter as an option. But the next question is, why should we care about that? Shouldnât criminals be the only ones who care? Not necessarily. Whether a person finds this property of self-custody to be worthwhile or not often depends on where they came from, what their life experiences are, and how much they trust the financial system and/or government in their area. In other words, there are plenty of use-cases for money-like bearer assets. Use-Case 1: Normal and Emergency Backup Itâs advisable to have some physical cash on hand for mild problems or outright emergencies. Have you ever been at a restaurant, with only cards and no cash, and for some reason the cards donât work? Suddenly you donât have the ability to exchange value with someone, and yet you owe them for the meal. Apart from the practical annoyances of fixing that situation, most people obviously hate that feeling, since it is embarrassing and disempowering. Itâs good to carry cash. From there, we can imagine more important scenarios. If youâre traveling in a foreign country, especially one thatâs less developed, losing your forms of payment could be a big problem. Imagine if you donât have cash on you, and your cards donât work or arenât accepted. What do you do? What if you memorized a bitcoin wallet seed phrase and could access it anywhere in the world with an internet or satellite connection if need be, even if all your stuff on your person gets stolen? Or how about a financial/electrical crisis? In 2015, during Greeceâs economic crisis, a run on banks resulted in bank withdraws being limited to 60 euros per day. Youâd have to wait in long lines just to get a trivial amount of cash. Having some cash or gold or bitcoin on hand before that problem began, was a good idea. In 2017, when Puerto Rico was devastated by a hurricane and the whole territory was without power, businesses couldnât accept credit cards, and cash was needed for everything. But many banks were closed and others were limiting withdraws to $100/day. Again, there were massive lines at banks and the handful of working ATMs. Bitcoin would have not been very useful in that environment, but physical cash and gold or silver would be. Alternatively, if youâre in an emerging market and your local currency inflates greatly (unfortunately not a rare occurrence, affecting billions of people in their lifetimes), then having gold or bitcoin is very helpful for preserving value, alongside other finite assets like real estate. For any number of these situations, having some physical cash and/or some gold/silver coins and/or bitcoin stashed around for times of emergency is a good idea. Each has moments where they could shine, and what they share in common is that they involve people taking direct possession of some portion of their assets with no counterparty risk. Use-Case 2: Banking the Unbanked About two-thirds of the population in El Salvador is unbanked. There are billions of people in the world without access to banks. However, many of them have access to inexpensive mobile phones and basic internet connections, and that number is growing rapidly as technology keeps getting cheaper. Itâs ironically easier to get someone a phone than a bank account these days. This was the premise behind Bitcoin Beach, an effort over the past couple years by charities and bitcoiners to use Bitcoinâs Lightning network to provide basic banking services to the population. Users could do instantaneous peer-to-peer transactions with their phones and store their assets as BTC or convert to USD. Strikeâs CEO, Jack Mallers, then began focusing on that country for using the Lightning network for international remittances (as I quoted Ross Stevens describing earlier), which is simply the application of software to make something far more efficient than it used to be, much like how software has eaten other legacy industries. Here in 2021, El Salvadorâs president noticed that success, and along with the legislature, decided to make bitcoin legal tender in the country and to actively promote its use. The point isnât that El Salvador is a model of international success; indeed itâs a very troubled country. However, for people following the progression here from Bitcoin Beach through efficient remittances through legal tender, itâs not quite as surprising, and in fact El Salvadorâs challenges are what led various communities to bring these bitcoin-based technologies to the country and use it as a testbed. It remains to be seen how successful it will be, but the fact that people have more options now is an improvement. A number of other politicians across a half-dozen other countries in Latin America also expressed public interest in similar bitcoin measures. Weâll see if any of them follow what El Salvador has done. The second act to this real-time experiment is that El Salvadorâs president also announced that the country will develop more of its volcanic renewable geothermal energy for bitcoin mining. Electrical transmission infrastructure is very expensive to build, which means even cheap sources of energy often go unused in the world. One of the advantages of bitcoin mining is that it can go to where the energy is, rather than most other types of energy demand that require energy being transmitted to where they are. This allows a new energy source to be rapidly monetized. So, sources of renewable energy that might not have otherwise been economical for exporting energy or otherwise transmitting it long distances, can potentially be developed for use with localized bitcoin mining to generate revenue. Then, at a later date, mining could optionally be reduced and additional infrastructure can bring that fully-developed energy to other types of demand.  Use-Case 3: Protection from Questionable Authorities Article 12 of the UNâs Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that privacy is a human right. Arbitrary interference with someoneâs privacy is considered an infringement of human rights. Of course, those rights are commonly infringed worldwide anyway. When corporations and governments can freely interfere with your privacy, it brings them a step closer to being able to infringe on speech or other rights. Lack of privacy is less of an immediate concern in benign political environments, but the majority of people on Earth live in regions that donât have full rights of speech and expression. Many governments ban certain speech, certain religions, certain relationships, certain protests, and certain transactions that other countries consider obvious human rights to be able to do. And benign political environments can turn into more problematic political environments over time, which is why many people seek to protect privacy even in those benign political environments. Basically, under this Article 12 way of thinking, people have a right to privacy, and have a right to use technology that protects their privacy from various entities, and only under the context of reasonable suspicion of a crime should governments be able to take lawful measures to gather information to prove the crime. Much like how people can use security systems to protect their property, they can use encryption to protect their information, including their transactions. The difficulty or burden of effort therefore gets placed on the entity (either government or corporate or individual) that wants to try to violate someoneâs privacy or to block their transactions. Reuters reported in early 2021 that Russiaâs opposition leader and anti-corruption lawyer, Alexei Navalny, uses bitcoin donations among their list of tools, as Russian authorities often attempt to block their funding:    Russian authorities periodically block the bank accounts of Navalnyâs Anti-Corruption Foundation, a separate organisation he founded which conducts investigations into official corruption. âThey are always trying to close down our bank accounts â but we always find some kind of workaround,â said Volkov. âWe use bitcoin because itâs a good legal means of payment. The fact that we have bitcoin payments as an alternative helps to defend us from the Russian authorities. They see if they close down other more traditional channels, we will still have bitcoin. Itâs like insurance.â  Similarly, a long social media thread by Bernard Parah, founder and CEO of the bitcoin-saving app Bitnob, expressed the experience that many Nigerians face, and explains why peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions are so popular in Nigeria:  Nigeriaâs central bank, as it struggles with a long-term inflation problem, banned its financial institutions from interacting with cryptocurrency. This hasnât disrupted peer-to-peer bitcoin trading and transactions, which continue to be robust in the country and in many other Sub-Saharan African countries. Popular podcaster Anita Posch has an ongoing series dedicated to studying the usage of bitcoin in Africa, and interviewing people involved with it in those regions. Posch has traveled to Zimbabwe to study the Bitcoin networkâs use-cases there.  Similarly, in an article called Check Your Financial Privilege, Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation examined the Bitcoin networkâs use-case in certain developing markets. He also recently appeared on the The Investorâs Podcast to discuss the human rights angle of the Bitcoin network. Here was an interesting part of the conversation:    So for Venezuelans to go through this has been nothing short of totally heartbreaking. However, there are a lot of folks who got involved early, like earlier, a lot of young people, a lot of young folks figured it out in 2015, â16, they were mining at the time. One of these guys I interviewed, he actually helped start Ledn, which is one of the larger industry services now based out of Canada. But he and his brothers were mining bitcoin for a couple of years there and they ended up having to escape. The government came with like an armed squad and seized all their mining equipment. Thankfully no one got hurt. The government was very perplexed. They saw the mining equipment and they thought that they meant they got the bitcoin. But thatâs not how it works. So they were able to use the bitcoin to start a new life in Canada. I thought that was really amazing. I interviewed another guy who escaped to Argentina. He got involved in some sort of dispute with the government where they claimed he was a criminal, even though he wasnât, but now heâs able to send money back to his mother who is in Venezuela in bitcoin. She uses it to support herself. Thereâs just so many stories like this. And I think for me, one of the most powerful things as someone whose family went through the Holocaust, was this idea of like, you could flee your country and back then you only brought what was on your back, like the clothing on your back. But today you can bring your wealth with you, which is truly remarkable. And Iâve given advice to people who are, for example, leaving Iran these days, help them out on this. People are selling their homes and theyâre converting to bitcoin and theyâre getting on a plane, getting the heck out, and theyâre bringing it with them in this digital format. People are sending money in and out of Syria to people who are stuck there. People have escaped countries like Sudan. I interviewed a guy from Sudan, which has a horrible inflation problem that their inflation is in the hundreds. They have an inflation rate of something like 150 or 200%. And heâs living in Europe and heâs sending the hardest money around back to his family in Khartoum. And theyâre able to get by through that. Weâre early here. Again, I think the estimate based on Coinbase numbers is that maybe 10% of Americans have interacted with Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. The global number is lower than that, especially in these emerging markets. If the global is two percent and Americaâs 10%, itâs probably way less than that in a lot of these emerging markets, but hey, in some of them, look at Turkey, man, look at Argentina, look at Nigeria. These are huge countries, 200 million, 100 million, 45 million people. Theyâve got the highest per capita usage in those countries. So itâs a changing world.  Basically, as volatile as bitcoin is, itâs an asset that is available to almost anyone in the world with a smartphone or any other internet connection (a 4.7 billion total addressable userbase and growing), with a finite supply cap, that since inception has had a tendency to appreciate against currencies and especially against the highly-inflationary currencies that are common in emerging and frontier markets, albeit with big ups and downs. Since the Bitcoin network has its own payment rails (especially with Lightning as the secondary layer), it also gets around various inefficiencies or outright blockages in existing payment systems. Even for places without cable internet, there are bitcoin satellites covering most of the worldâs land mass at this point, meaning one can transact in bitcoin even when off the grid. Bringing it back to the United States and other developed countries, all sorts of content producers deal with de-platforming from third-party online payment services for expressing certain views. Whether we agree with their views or not, itâs not hard to see why some of them have turned to BTCPay Server and other bitcoin payment software in order to strengthen themselves against de-platforming. Back in 2015, a popular comparison made its way around the media; federal law enforcement reached a point where it seized more cash in the United States per year than burglars did, and that doesnât even include the impact of state or local law enforcement.  Chart Source: Washington Post A lot of that cash is seized from criminals. But someone doesnât need to be found guilty of a crime, or even charged with a crime, for police to take physical cash or other assets from them. After that increase in public awareness, the practice seemingly got more pressure and reported numbers started to move back down. Later, the Washington Post reported in 2018 about a number of examples of civil forfeiture that didnât involve a crime, and it often took months to get the cash back. And itâs a disproportionate burden for low income people that donât have the resources to initiate a lawsuit to get their property back. From the article:    Under a little-known legal tool called civil forfeiture, the government can permanently take a personâs property if an officer suspects it is connected to a crime. In criminal cases, forfeiture occurs after a conviction, ordered by a judge as part of a sentence. In civil forfeiture, even if the rightful owner is not charged with any crime, the person stands to lose the property permanently. Civil forfeitures happens every day, according to Darpana Sheth, senior attorney and director of the Institute for Justiceâs nationwide initiative to end forfeiture abuse. [â¦] Historically used in cases of piracy and admiralty, in which a crime is alleged overseas, a civil forfeiture case is brought against the property, not the person. âThe idea is based on a legal fiction that the property itself is guilty,â Sheth said.  Hereâs Wikipediaâs overview of the subject:    Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture, is a process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself. Civil forfeiture is not considered to be an example of a criminal justice financial obligation. Proponents see civil forfeiture as a powerful tool to thwart criminal organizations involved in the illegal drug trade, with $12 billion annual profits, since it allows authorities to seize cash and other assets from suspected narcotics traffickers. They also argue that it is an efficient method since it allows law enforcement agencies to use these seized proceeds to further battle illegal activity, that is, directly converting value obtained for law enforcement purposes by harming suspected criminals economically while helping law enforcement financially. Critics argue that innocent owners can become entangled in the process to the extent that their 4th Amendment and 5th Amendment rights are violated, in situations where they are presumed guilty instead of being presumed innocent. It has been described as unconstitutional by a judge in South Carolina. Further, critics argue that the incentives lead to corruption and law enforcement misbehavior. There is consensus that abuses have happened but disagreement about their extent as well as whether the overall benefits to society are worth the cost of the instances of abuse.  And as reported by the Washington Post in 2020, Homeland Security seized over $2 billion in cash going through airports between 2000 and 2016, with 70% of cases involving no arrest. People generally had to go through months of legal action to get it back, if they get it back at all. They have the burden of proof to prove their right to have their own cash, rather than the burden of proof being on those who confiscated it. If itâs this much of an issue in the United States, imagine the corruption that people in developing countries face with arbitrary confiscations. People easily get their funds seized when transporting cash or gold through airports, especially over international borders. And people fleeing war-torn areas or failed states generally have trouble bringing anything of value with them. The neat thing about bitcoin is that the private keys can be transported in an app in a password-protected phone (and nearly 4 billion people have smartphones now), or can even be memorized as a seed phrase. It moves invisibly and with encryption. Encrypted money, both as a potential store of value and transaction network, makes it difficult or impossible for questionable authorities to block transactions or seize funds, or even know that there are funds to seize (like traveling with a smart phone or memorized seed phrase that accesses a bitcoin wallet, rather than physical cash). Legitimate authorities generally donât like the existence of that technology either, since like any form of technology it can be used for malicious intent, but ultimately it comes down to what degree of privacy and self-autonomy people should have, and who the burden of proof should be on to seize assets or block transactions. That is why the Human Rights Foundation, a nonprofit organization chaired by Garry Kasparov that deals with human rights issues around the world, has been a proponent of the Bitcoin network and operates the HRF Bitcoin Development Fund. Criminals are often early adopters of new technology, since they have a strong incentive to be innovative in that way. But that doesnât mean the technology itself is the problem; new discoveries and their applications are inevitable. Banning bitcoin (which at the end of the day is really basic albeit elegant tech) amounts to banning information; banning the use of an open source decentralized public ledger with numbers to access it. Thatâs why in developed countries with rule of law, the emphasis has been on regulating it and ensuring the government gets their share of capital gains taxes. As a similar case, criminals were early adopters of beepers in the 1980s, but that didnât make beepers themselves bad. Hereâs a snippet from a July 1988 Washington Post article:    When a drug dealer is in trouble, he sometimes dials 911. But he isnât trying to reach the police. Instead, this message is sent to a drug courier wearing a beeper that displays messages dialed from a phone: 911 means the police are closing in. Although paging devices, or beepers, have grown in popularity throughout the labor force â doctors, delivery people and journalists often use them â they also have become a staple in the drug business, posing fresh problems for law enforcement and threatening to tarnish the image of a booming high-tech industry. About 6.5 million beepers are in use in the country, according to officials, although it is difficult to estimate what percentage is used for drug trafficking. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials said that beepers, which have been used by bookies and cigarette smugglers, were introduced in the drug market about five years ago by Colombian cocaine organizations. Now, federal narcotics agents estimate that at least 90 percent of drug dealers use them.  Now that the Bitcoin network is a bit more mainstream (no longer the early Silk Road days), itâs relatively easy for algorithms to sort through the public ledger and so itâs not a great platform for criminals. The analysis firm Chainalysis, which serves law enforcement agencies and private institutions in terms of analyzing public blockchains, determined from multiple annual studies that only 0.5%-2% of cryptocurrency transactions are used for illegal activities in a given year.  Chart Source: Chainalysis Investment banks alone have paid over $331 billion in fines for various illegal activities in the fiat currency system since the year 2000. So when, for example, Colonial Pipeline gets hit with a $4.4 million ransomware attack using bitcoin as the medium of payment, itâs important to be aware of total numbers and relative scale of these things, rather than just narratives about what bitcoin is used for with individual examples. And in this case, because the coins associated with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack could be tracked and the hackers apparently didnât store their funds in a private hardware wallet, a large portion of the funds were taken back. There have been multiple studies to determine what percentage of global GDP consists of illegal activities, or more broadly, the size of the âshadow economyâ which consists of illegal and semi-illegal economic activity. A July 2010 paper by the World Bank determined that the shadow economy consists of 17.2% of GDP across 162 nations on a weighted-average basis between 1997 and 2007. Investopedia has an article that collects multiple studies across the years, with 12-14% being common estimates for multiple studies, with low-end studies pointing towards maybe only 7%. A study by the US BEA determined that during about a century of data, adding theft from businesses, illegal gambling, prostitution, and drug trafficking would add 1-4% to US GDP per year, and that doesnât include theft from individuals, human trafficking, or a variety of other shadow economy activities. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that the annual amount of global money laundering is 2-5% of global GDP. An often-cited old study found that 80% of cash has traces of cocaine on it. In other words, at a 0.5% to 2% use case, bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space may ironically have a lower share of criminal activity than fiat currency on a percentage-of-transaction basis. And if we think about it, that makes sense. Criminals wouldnât necessarily want to do their nefarious deeds on an immutable public ledger, susceptible to tracking and analysis. The old-school suitcase full of cash in private is still better for that purpose in most cases. There are some blockchains that have stronger privacy features than the Bitcoin network, but they make trade-offs like less-reliable security/verification, in order to do that. In other words, the Bitcoin network is a privacy enhancement over many types of banking activities, especially when using lightning or some of the other privacy methods, and the upcoming Taproot update will further enhance privacy to some extent. But itâs not as private as physical cash against serious on-chain analysis. Use Case 4: Defense Against Negative Rates or Cash Phase-Outs During recessions, central banks often cut interest rates by several percentage points. After decades of this, developed country interest rates are all stuck around zero, with little more room to cut rates. They can go mildly negative, to -0.5% or so, because people will pay for security rather than having all their cash under their mattress. But if rates go to say -4%, a lot of people would likely pull their cash out of banks. They wouldnât sit there and let their $1000 turn into $960 on year one and then turn into $921 on year two, and so on. A 2019 IMF article called âCashing in: How to Make Negative Interest Rates Workâ describes the issue well:    In a cashless world, there would be no lower bound on interest rates. A central bank could reduce the policy rate from, say, 2 percent to minus 4 percent to counter a severe recession. The interest rate cut would transmit to bank deposits, loans, and bonds. Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive. This would jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy. When cash is available, however, cutting rates significantly into negative territory becomes impossible. Cash has the same purchasing power as bank deposits, but at zero nominal interest. Moreover, it can be obtained in unlimited quantities in exchange for bank money. Therefore, instead of paying negative interest, one can simply hold cash at zero interest. Cash is a free option on zero interest, and acts as an interest rate floor. Because of this floor, central banks have resorted to unconventional monetary policy measures. The euro area, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and other economies have allowed interest rates to go slightly below zero, which has been possible because taking out cash in large quantities is inconvenient and costly (for example, storage and insurance fees). These policies have helped boost demand, but they cannot fully make up for lost policy space when interest rates are very low. One option to break through the zero lower bound would be to phase out cash.  That article links to a 2018 IMF working paper that tackled the same subject in more detail. Due to the challenges of entirely phasing out cash, however, they instead propose splitting the monetary base into two parts, where physical cash would devalue vs. cash stored in the financial system by a rate that is equivalent to the negative rates applied to deposited cash, so that negative rates are effectively applied to physical cash as well. Thereâs no escape from deeply nominal negative interest rates, in other words. NBER Working Paper 25416, published in 2019 and featuring Larry Summers as a co-author, further discussed the issues that paper currency presents against substantially negative-rate policy: Second, if the deposit lower bound is overcome, our model predicts that negative policy rates should be an effective way to stimulate the economy. This could happen if banks over time become more willing to experiment with negative deposit rates, and depositors do not substitute to cash, or if there are institutional changes which affect the deposit lower bound. In Section 4 we consider under which conditions this could happen. An example of such policies is a direct tax on paper currency, as proposed first by Gesell (Gesell, 1916) and discussed in detail by Goodfriend (2000) and Buiter and Panigirtzoglou (2003) or actions that increase the storage cost of money, such as eliminating high denomination bills. Another possibility is abolishing paper currency altogether. These policies are discussed in, among others, Agarwal and Kimball (2015), Rogoff (2017a) and Rogoff (2017c), who also suggest more elaborate policy regimes to circumvent the zero lower bound. What we saw in 2020 was that instead of turning to deeply negative rates, governments relied more heavily on pro-inflationary fiscal policy (which is the same as the 1930s and 1940s; the last time the zero bound was reached, as part of the prior apex of the long-term debt cycle). Ultimately I think thatâs the more likely route in the long term; that greater use of fiscal policy at the zero bound will be used to kickstart the next cycle, and that over-use of monetary policy involving a situation like -4% nominal interest rates is unlikely. However, itâs important to follow these sorts of influential papers to see how policymakers are thinking about policy. Here in 2021, China has been testing a central bank digital currency that can a) more easily track or block transactions, b) can set up expiration dates on money to ensure it is spent rather than saved and c) can automatically deduct money from or freeze accounts associated with individual entities. Here are some snippets from an April 2021 WSJ article:    China has indicated the digital yuan will circulate alongside bills and coins for some time. Bankers and other analysts say Beijing aims to digitize all of its money eventually. Beijing hasnât addressed that. ___ The money itself is programmable. Beijing has tested expiration dates to encourage users to spend it quickly, for times when the economy needs a jump start. Itâs also trackable, adding another tool to Chinaâs heavy state surveillance. The government deploys hundreds of millions of facial-recognition cameras to monitor its population, sometimes using them to levy fines for activities such as jaywalking. A digital currency would make it possible to both mete out and collect fines as soon as an infraction was detected. ___ More than 60 countries are at some stage of studying or developing a digital currency, according to research group CBDC Tracker.  Is it surprising that a significant minority of people would turn to yellow metal, or create a bearer asset network backed up by encryption, to avoid these sorts of things with a portion of their savings? While it wouldnât be ideal to put everything into physical cash, physical gold, or self-custodied bitcoin, having a nonzero amount of oneâs net worth in those types of assets is prudent. Investors Donât Have to Self-Custody Some societies are more collectivist or individualistic than others, and then within those societies, various members range across a spectrum of how much they trust the system. I think a big portion of oneâs perception on this topic of gold or bitcoin is shaped by life experiences or disposition. Growing up in a smooth environment where things just âworkâ, with no major currency failures or oppressive regimes, leads one to trust institutions more. They are fine with the concept of centralization, and giving up certain rights in exchange for certain conveniences. From that perspective, gold is thought of as a plaything for cranky old men who yell at the Fed, and bitcoin is thought of as a casino millennial asset and/or criminalâs paradise. However, by expanding our perception of different lived experiences throughout the world, we can see why these sorts of assets can be desirable to many people. And when it comes to investing in these self-custodied assets, an important fact of course is that not everyone has to self-custody them. As long as someone understands why someone might want to self-custody them, and understands why their use as assets that have the property of being able to be self-custodied is valuable, they can invest in those assets through custodians if theyâd prefer, or if for regulatory reasons they have to. In other words, the inherent ability of these assets to be self-custodied as bearer assets is a critical part of their value proposition, but not every user needs to self-custody their allocation to them. They can hold cash in a bank, buy a gold ETF, buy gold miners, buy bitcoin via a fund or custodian, and so forth if theyâd prefer or otherwise need to. Understanding the Pushback  Back in 2016, the World Economic Forum had a blog article called, âWelcome to 2030: I Own Nothing, Have No Privacy, and Life has Never Been Better,â by Danish politician Ida Auken. The World Economic Forum followed this up with a 2017 social media campaign that included themes from that article. The article and media campaign emphasized how the world is shifting more and more towards using services rather than ownership. For those that arenât familiar with it, the World Economic Forum hosts the annual Davos gathering of politicians and business leaders from around the world to influence policy and share ideas. In the article, Auken envisioned a semi-utopian and semi-dystopian outcome by 2030 where people have access to whatever they want as a service thanks to AI and robotics, but they own basically nothing and their every move is tracked with no privacy. In the narrative, some people live out in the countryside, having fled from this regime. Aukenâs 2030 imagined self is worried about those folks in the narrative, and very happy with her life despite some of the disadvantages relating to privacy, and views many of the steps taken as necessary.  This media campaign got a lot of renewed attention in late 2020 in response to the World Economic Forum chairman Klaus Schwabâs 2020 Time Magazine cover article and media campaign, âThe Great Resetâ, which was about responding to the pandemic crisis with re-alignments about global priorities. It led to some online viral conspiracy theories portraying Schwab almost like a James Bond villain or Illuminati ring leader with a master plan, leading places like the Reuters Fact Check team to look into the matter and indeed regard them as conspiracies. After this viral activity, the World Economic Forum went back and deleted a number of their 2017 tweets and the original 2016 blog post. They must have realized that the campaign wasnât great marketing. The version on Forbes from back in 2016 still exists as of this writing. I think both the initial campaign and the viral conspiracy pushback, for better or worse, are instructive. They crystalize some of the cultural divides out there, and itâs important to see how some people envision the world and how other people really see things differently. People took things too far when interpreting the scope of these articles and media campaigns, but they also understandably saw encroachment on autonomy, privacy, and property by policymakers and political influencers, when it comes to the general direction of where things are headed. So, itâs not surprising that a significant subset of people prefer to self-custody some of their assets in one way or another, and bearer assets like gold, silver, and bitcoin are popular for that reason. They donât want to âown nothing and be happyâ; they want to take custody of monetary assets. Gold and Bitcoin Pricing Environments Fiat currency loses value over the long term, but in most cases is stable in the short term. These other assets are far more volatile in the short term, but historically have held or increased their value over the long term. Due to this volatility, there are bull and bear markets for gold and bitcoin. This makes sense, because there are environments where fiat currency is rather robust, and other environments where fiat currency is being devalued. There are some reliable signals that investors can use to evaluate these types of environments. Letâs separate gold and bitcoin because they operate very differently so far in terms of pricing environments. Gold Pricing Gold is mainly a risk-off asset. In the long-run, it is correlated to broad money supply growth while in the intermediate-term it is more correlated (inversely) to inflation-adjusted interest rates. For example, hereâs a recent history of the gold price in red vs. real 10-year Treasury rates:  Chart Source: St. Louis Fed Gold is a zero-yielding asset with frictional costs, but whose supply is scarce and changes very slowly. When real rates on currencies and sovereign bonds are heading lower, and especially when they are negative, gold becomes a lot more attractive than fiat currency. Conversely, when real rates are strongly positive, gold tends to be out of favor. This makes sense. When a 10-year Treasury offers you a 7% annual yield while inflation is 3%, you get a 4% real rate of return. Gold would be less attractive in that environment due to the high opportunity cost of earning a strongly positive real yield with Treasuries. On the other hand, if the 10-year Treasury offers you a 2% annual yield while inflation is 4%, you get a -2% real rate of return. Gold is way more attractive in that environment since the opportunity cost is negative. Gold is both scarce and ironically higher-yielding in that environment. In that sense, gold is not specifically an inflation hedge; itâs a hedge against negative real yields (albeit in practice, the deepest negative real yields tend to occur in times of high and sharply-rising inflation). However, while real interest rates can give us a good idea of direction, they donât tell us much about magnitude. What approximate magnitude should gold be valued at? Thatâs the age-old problem of evaluating a non-cashflow asset, or a money-like asset. People often compare the gold price to broad money growth, but they forget to take into account the fact that gold has an inflation rate too, albeit a low one. The above-ground supply of gold grows at an average of a bit over 1.5% per year over the long run, thanks to mining. Itâs important to factor that in when comparing gold to fiat money supplies. NYDIG had a good chart of goldâs annual new supply rate in their November 2020 research piece:  Chart Source: NYDIG Hereâs an annual chart, with over a century of data, that shows the estimated global gold market capitalization compared to the US broad money supply:  There were some periods on the chart where gold was really cheap according to this ratio. In the 1950s and 1960s, this was because gold was suppressed by the government via the gold peg. Eventually that arrangement broke in 1971 and gold revalued much higher to a market clearing rate. Similarly, there was a deep commodity bear market in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and gold became unusually cheap for several years. Other periods on the chart were bubbles. In 1934, the US government devalued the gold peg, which marked the price of gold up by about 70% in dollar terms overnight. In the late 1970s, as inflation roared and real interest rates hit as low as -5%, gold bubbled up to extremely high levels. In 2011, after the global financial crisis, introduction of quantitative easing, and real 10-year interest rates getting almost as low as -2%, gold had a third bubble. Hereâs a monthly resolution version of that chart, covering the five decades of goldâs comparatively free-floating price period. I added the inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yield on the right axis:  Next, this chart separates the gold market capitalization from US money supply, and shows them separately in absolute terms:  Lastly, hereâs the log version of that previous chart, which more clearly shows gold tending to spike when rates become deeply negative:  Bitcoin Pricing Bitcoin is more challenging, because itâs a newer asset with a smaller market capitalization, and more volatility. Unlike gold, it tends to be a risk-on asset more often than not. So far, bitcoinâs biggest correlation is with its own supply cycle. Every four years, the number of new coins generated by the algorithm every 10 minutes gets cut in half, and there tends to be a âpost-halvingâ bull run. Hereâs the bitcoin price in log form, with halving points annotated:  Chart Source: Blockchain.com If we look at on-chain data, the percentage of bitcoin held by long-term holders tends to decrease during bull markets and increase during bear markets, as the protocol goes through these big distribution cycles:  Chart Source: Look Into Bitcoin With the Bitcoin network, weâre basically witnessing something being monetized in real time. It was the fastest asset to touch a $1 trillion market capitalization, and reached 100 million estimated users in fewer years than the internet did from its launch. The market is essentially trying to estimate the Bitcoin networkâs total addressable market in real time, like a growth stock, while taking into account various risks including network effect dilutions from crypto competitors, the prospects of government bans, and various security concerns ranging from the diminishing block subsidy to the potential tail risk impact of quantum computing. Is its total addressable market only 10% of goldâs market cap (which it already reached) before trending downward towards irrelevance, since unlike gold, the Bitcoin network has to constantly fend off dilutive competitors in every bull cycle? Or 50%? Or 100%? Or could it eventually be worth 200% or 300%+ of goldâs market cap, since itâs digitally native and thus easier to access and build on with secondary layers and a variety of apps, and has been recognized as legal tender in some areas? Ultimately, the answer isnât known yet, which is why itâs so volatile. Rather than being a store of value now, I prefer to describe it as an emergent store of value. According to on-chain data and exchange data, somewhere in the ballpark of 2-3% of people globally own or have owned it. It is a 12.5 year project that has been wildly successful but that still faces existential challenges and risks, and the market is trying to judge its probability of success, and trying to define what success would even look like. Like other risk-on assets, it is significantly tied to liquidity. Whenever real rates become high or liquidity shocks happen, bitcoin tends to crash. When liquidity is abundant and broad money supply growth is happening quickly, bitcoin tends to do well. But thatâs in the broader cycle of its supply creation and overall network effect and user adoption. Summary Thoughts Hopefully this piece was helpful in showing why bearer assets like gold and bitcoin are considered valuable to a substantial minority of the population. Some people want to take custody of money-like assets that resist debasement, and the percentage of people that feel this way generally depends on political and economic conditions in their area, and specifically how well their local fiat currency is holding up in terms of positive real interest rates and maintenance of stable purchasing power. To imagine this, we often have to put ourselves in someone elseâs shoes to see what they experience.  In addition, bitcoin opens up the possibility of permissionless local and international payments and internet-native money for micropayments and other use-cases. It also results in simple apps to give unbanked populations some degree of banking services. Itâs an evolving field and itâs hard to say what the ecosystem will look like 5-10 years from now, but itâs a space I plan to continue to monitor and remain pretty excited about.",2021-06-15

Other loss, net primarily constitutes our interest expense, net of interest income. Acquisition and integration costs primarily relate to the acquisition of HKFS and the acquisition of 1st Global.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We use this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management and compensation purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting our business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant and necessary components to the operations of our business and, therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income (loss).

We exclude the non-cash portion of income tax expense because of our ability to offset a substantial portion of our cash tax liabilities by using deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of U.S. federal net operating losses. The majority of these net operating losses will either be utilized or expire between 2021 and 2024.We believe that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share provide meaningful supplemental information to management, investors, and analysts regarding our performance and the valuation of our business by excluding items in the statement of operations that we do not consider part of our ongoing operations or have not been, or are not expected to be, settled in cash. Additionally, we believe that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are common measures used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance and the valuation of our business.

Moscow sees the effort as critical in stemming an already raging 21st-century digital arms race and avoiding a miscalculation that could spark a conflict between the two top military powers.Such an inadvertent conflagration becomes especially dangerous in the absence of ""red lines"" not yet established among nations and non-state actors, who are also quickly honing potentially devastating cyber capabilities.Putin made note of this latent threat in September, asserting that ""one of today's major strategic challenges is the risk of a large-scale confrontation in the digital field,"" part of remarks referred to Newsweek by the Russian embassy in Washington.The comment came alongside a four-point plan to establish high-level communication between Washington and Moscow on what Russia refers to as ""international information security,"" including through existing bodies dealing with nuclear and computer readiness, as well as through the establishment of new rules of the road mirroring U.S.-Soviet agreements on avoiding maritime incidents, and mutual ""guarantees of non-intervention into internal affairs of each other.""Putin is also seeking is a global agreement on ""no-first-strike"" regarding communications technologies, another reference to the nuclear technologies that long dominated the discourse on arms control, and still do today.Contacted regarding the prospect of pursuing such a deal, the State Department referred Newsweek to the White House, which referred to national security adviser Jake Sullivan's assurances that both nuclear and cyber issues would be on the table Wednesday.Sullivan said Wednesday that nuclear talks remained the ""starting point"" for bilateral discussions, and ""whether additional elements get added to strategic stability talks in the realm of space or cyber or other areas, that's something to be determined as we go forward.""But as the U.S. continues to prove vulnerable to ransomware attacks from shadowy groups believed to be operating out of Russia or other former Soviet bloc countries, those with experience in advising the White House on challenges from the region urge Biden to take the opportunity to send a message.""What I want is for Biden to very clearly explain what the risk is to Vladimir Putin, that we are not going to back down if we are attacked by Russia,"" Evelyn Farkas, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, ""and we're going to be the ones that decide what a 'cyber Pearl Harbor' is, which means Russia doesn't control the escalation dynamic.""  Members of the U.S. Cyber Command are seen at headquarters in this undated photo released by the Pentagon.  Petty Officer 1st Class Samuel Souvannason/U.S. Navy For generations, December 7, 1941 was a date that lived ""in infamy,"" a catalyst for the U.S. entry into the largest war known to mankind. Nearly seven decades later, 9/11 showcased in even deadlier terms a new kind of threat that could strike with little warning, dragging the U.S. into a conflict it is still waging today across the globe.The threat in the cyber realm has yet to emerge clearly into the open, but recent events suggest how quickly and quietly events could escalate. Just in the past year, this has been demonstrated by mass infiltrations like last year's SolarWinds hack. This was followed by a pair of major ransomware attacks, one that prompted a panic over a fuel shortage as the nation's largest gas pipeline shut down, and another that disrupted the food supply chain as U.S. operations of the world's largest beef supplier were forced to close.Both the companies behind Colonial Pipeline and JBS USA paid multimillion-dollar ransoms in cryptocurrency, a controversial idea that defies the traditional U.S. government stance of not giving into the demands of ""terrorists.""But it's hard to imagine another way private companies could react as long as they remain helpless to such a cyber onslaught from abroad. Potential victims of such attacks, likely to multiply in severity and scope if left unregulated, also seek answers.""I mean, imagine if you're a healthcare system, you're going to have people dying,"" J.D. Cook, a former senior CIA official, told Newsweek. ""My mom's taking chemo, chemo, all of that other stuff is computerized. You think I care about that principle of you not paying a ransom if my mom dies? If my mom dies because of a ransomware attack, it'll hit home.""While he said such analogies as Pearl Harbor were tantalizing to a public growing increasingly aware of the effects that such cyber capabilities could have on their lives, he urged those tasked with crafting strategy on the issue to just ""go and do something, you need to do something and do it tomorrow.""Another relevant historical analogy is that of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which had less to do with the communist-led island 90 miles off of Florida and more with two superpowers testing how close to each other's territory they could position nuclear-capable weapons.""We almost went to nuclear war,"" Raj Shah, chairman of the cybersecurity insurance firm Resilience, told Newsweek.The standoff that brought the world to the brink barely avoided a potentially apocalyptic exchange between Washington and Moscow. It did, however, pave the way for landmark treaties that would ultimately reverse the then-untethered buildup and deployment of nuclear weapons.Shah said it is now time for the U.S. to express what red lines look like in the cyber realm, and then back it up with a staunch deterrence capable of enforcing them.""We have to be open about it, and we have to be able to communicate what those lines are, and then defend them so there's not a miscalculation on the other way,"" he said. ""But I think the status quo of our pipelines going down every week is not tenable.""And even though the situation may seem relatively calm on the surface, these lines are being tested everyday. Conflicts are playing out with increasing velocity and viciousness behind the screens of some of the country's most vital infrastructure.So much so that a Department of Homeland Security combining the two areas was established in 2018, known as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA). Brian Harrell, who served as CISA's assistant director of infrastructure security until last August, can attest to the seriousness of this challenge.""Our critical infrastructure sectors are the modern day battlefield and cyberspace is the great equalizer,"" Brian Harrell, former Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security at CISA, told Newsweek. ""Hacker groups can essentially attack with little individual attribution and virtually no consequence. With over 85% of all infrastructure owned and operated by the private sector, significant investment and attention must be placed on hardening key critical systems. I anticipate more attacks focused on energy, water, and financial services happening in the future.""It might only be a matter of time before an adversary goes too far, forcing the battle out of the shadows into the open.""If a nation-state adversary were to set foot on our homeland and physically destroy our infrastructure, we would view this as an act of war,"" Harrell said. ""We should have a very similar mindset with respect to an enemy destroying or degrading our critical systems with a cyber attack.""One such attack that seemed to test the boundaries came in February, when a still-undisclosed group managed to remotely access the controls of a water treatment center in Oldsmar, Florida and increased the output of sodium hydroxide, a highly caustic chemical also known as lye, from a safe 100 parts per million to a dangerous 11,100 ppm.If even one person had died as a result of this, or a future attack, it may prove a game changer.""The cyber red line—I think everybody is fairly clear on this—is loss of life,"" William Hurd, a former CIA clandestine officer who served in Congress as a Texas representative from 2015 to this January, told Newsweek.He referenced the incident in Florida as one that could have elicited a ""kinetic response""—military action—if U.S. lives were lost.Doug Wise, who served in the CIA as a member of the Senior Intelligence Service and was deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, also drew the line at U.S. casualties. But a U.S. response to even in the worst-case scenarios is a matter of uncharted territory.""That's the beauty of these cyber attacks, because we struggle at trying to compare the attack mechanism to the kinetic attack mechanism, particularly, strategic to strategic,"" Wise told Newsweek. ""It's ones and zeros and malware versus one-megaton warheads on Titans and on B-1's. How do you make that comparison so you can decide on proportional responses?""And then there's the intrinsic challenge of attribution when it comes to cyberwarfare, a realm in which actions are deliberately shrouded in deception and uncertainty.""I think it would take a significant cyber attack against the aviation infrastructure, power infrastructure, water distribution, and the transportation infrastructure,"" Wise said. ""I think it would take probably two to three simultaneous attacks against these targets, along with clear attribution. The attribution issue is always the stumbling block.""Identifying the source and location is the unique challenge in cyberwarfare, he said.When you launch a missile, you get a kinetic signature from which you can generate geo-coordinates for the point of origin,"" Wise said. ""With a cyber attack, the origin is obscured as well as the transport path, thus making attribution to the actual actor a significant challenge. Would the United States be willing to start World War III absent exquisite attribution, or go against a Russian organized crime group? I think not.""While the Biden administration has not directly blamed the Kremlin for the recent ransomware incidents, U.S. officials have called on their Russian counterparts to hold the groups behind the attack accountable. Putin said during an interview with the Rossiya-1 outlet that he would agree to extradition of those arrested in Russia should the U.S. do the same, something Biden has vowed he would reciprocate in the event such attacks were launched from U.S. soil.He called Putin's similar assurance ""potentially a good sign and progress.""Part of Russia's strategy in raising these issues with the U.S. is to seek a seat at the table as the protocols of this brave new frontier are crafted in the midst of ongoing cyber clashes.

""Our critical infrastructure relies on computer systems as much as it does physical systems. The line between the digital world and the real world is quickly disappearing.""Bolton, who served as CISA's cyber policy lead in the Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans, also sees loss of life, or ""significant physical destruction,"" as the likely threshold for a U.S. response that transcends those two worlds. She acknowledged the gravity of this eventuality and supported dialogue, but she also urged an even tougher U.S. position against Russia.""Yes, looking for additional ways to punish Russia for it's bad behavior in the cyber realm could be risking escalation,"" Bolton said. ""But if we don't face the risk of escalation, we face another, more dangerous risk-letting Russia get away with doing whatever it wants in cyberspace.""While the U.S. and Russia calculate their readiness to engage one another through strength or dialogue in the cyber world, they've also scrambled to hone their online arsenals. Here, the U.S. retains an advantage.But as the leaders of two nations who dominated the premier geopolitical competition of the late 20th century take the stage Wednesday, the U.S. has once again pulled ahead of its rival in developing current and future capabilities leveraged on new battlefields, the likes of which the world has never seen.""Domains of competition, it's not strictly military anymore,"" Mike Madsen, who serves as Director of Strategic Engagement for the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit, told Newsweek. ""It's economic, it's social, it's all these different things. We talked about air superiority and air supremacy, and there's a day when there's going to be concepts of cyber curiosity and cyber supremacy in a domain of competition.""He said that domain is already becoming a reality, of concern not only to Pentagon planners, but one that can and has affected the everyday U.S. citizen.""In this era of Great Power competition, the technology race is the most important front,"" Madsen said. ""It is critical that DoD not only attract the best emerging commercial technology and talent by lowering the barriers to entry, but to integrate this technology into our systems.""He noted that national security issues have expanded beyond the traditional military parameters.Our nation's security today is no longer limited to military strength but it also relies on our economic health,"" Madsen said, ""and we need to leverage our asymmetric advantage of the serial entrepreneurship of technology ecosystem which birthed Silicon Valley, where the triad of government, academia and industry work together.""As such, the U.S. has invested heavily in its own cyber capabilities, seeking to outpace Russia and other competitors to achieve and maintain what's known as a Qualitative Military Edge (QME) using both public and private assets.""Achieving QME is an endless effort that requires constant innovation and commitment to gain advantages over adversaries, technically and tactically,"" Amyn Gilani, chief growth officer at CounterCraft, a cybersecurity firm that sets out to thwart virtual threats such as ransomware attacks, told Newsweek.Doing so, he argues, takes the efforts of both public sector entities such as DIU and private institutions like his own.""This is why it is essential for the federal government to collaborate with the most innovative technology companies to achieve cyberspace superiority,"" said Gilanie, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence analyst who supported projects at U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security. ""It is essential that the federal government leverage the private sector to fulfill technology needs and prototype solutions to fine-tune customers' needs.""As public-private partnerships have helped enhance the country's cyber capabilities in a similar way it's fueled innovation among more conventional arms, the U.S. has also turned to its existing alliances abroad to tackle foreign foes in the digital domain. The foremost of these coalitions is the 30-state NATO, which in 2019 added discussions of cyber attacks to the admissibility of Article 5—collective defense.Contacted by Newsweek, a NATO spokesperson referred to discussions that took place among the alliance as Biden visited Europe over the weekend.""Reaffirming NATO's defensive mandate, the Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law,"" a joint statement issued Monday by the heads of NATO states. ""We reaffirm that a decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.""If serious enough, NATO members agreed that ""the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.""The statement said NATO would intensify its focus in the cyber realm, including ""sharing concerns about malicious cyber activities, and exchanging national approaches and responses, as well as considering possible collective responses.""""If necessary, we will impose costs on those who harm us,"" the statement added. ""Our response need not be restricted to the cyber domain.""  This combination of pictures created shows then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden—now president—during a speech in Darby, Pennsylvania, on June 17, 2020 and Russian President Vladimir Putin delivering a speech at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow on January 31, 2018. Biden is set to follow in the path of his predecessors in attempting an early reset in U.S.-Russia relations, but issues straining ties between the two powers have only multiplied in recent years. JIM WATSON/GRIGORY DUKOR/AFP/Getty Images The prospect of a ""physical"" attack in response to cyberattacks already has a real-life precedent. The U.S. has already targeted the cyber capabilities of the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) in operations, with an August 2015 airstrike that killed jihadi hacker Junaid Hussain in the de facto caliphate capital of Raqqa, Syria.But the first known example of an immediate, kinetic reaction came nearly four years later elsewhere in the Middle East.In May 2019, the Israel Defense Forces reported that they ""thwarted an attempted Hamas cyber offensive against Israeli targets"" by conducting an airstrike on an alleged headquarters in the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip. Israeli forces similarly targeted Hamas cyber stations during last month's 11-day war with Hamas and allied Palestinian factions in Gaza.Though the fallout from both operations remained relatively contained, how such a response would play out on the state-versus-state level remains anyone's guess. In the meantime, the U.S. and Russia were already playing a murky game behind smokescreens of code.U.S. Cyber Command partners with foreign governments on missions known as ""hunt forward operations,"" in which ""defensive cyber teams are invited by other nations to gather insights from their government networks on adversary behavior,"" a U.S. Cyber Command spokesperson told Newsweek.""These operations are one part of our 'defend forward' strategy—where we see what our adversaries are doing, and share with our partners in the homeland to bolster defense,"" the spokesperson said.In one such mission targeting Russia's alleged cyber activities, U.S. forces ""discovered and disclosed new malware associated with the SolarWinds incident, and then provided key mitigation of the malware, attributed to Russian intelligence SVR.""U.S. Cyber Tools Turned Against Americans, Limiting Biden's Russia OptionsRead more U.S. Cyber Tools Turned Against Americans, Limiting Biden's Russia Options ""When we disclose adversary malware used to conduct espionage; we not only harden our own networks, inoculate more broadly and improve collective cybersecurity,"" the spokesperson said, ""but we also impose costs disrupting adversaries time, money, and access.""The concept of ""defense forward"" is the broader cyber strategy that includes what's known as ""persistent engagement.""""The Department is continuously defending itself from malicious activity and, more broadly, defending the country from significant malicious actions through persistent engagement,"" a Pentagon spokesperson told Newsweek. ""Our persistent engagement activity generates insights that are shared with Federal and private sector partners, making us all more secure. The President may direct the Department to conduct additional cyber operations when he deems them necessary.""As NATO's joint communique asserted, the Biden administration has considered a range of options in response to major cyberattacks.""The way that I've consistently characterized our response when it came to SolarWinds and to other cyberattacks of that scope and scale is that we are prepared to take responsive actions that are seen and unseen,"" Sullivan told reporters Sunday, ""and I'll leave it at that.""Russian officials have raised concerns regarding such statements and, in an NBC News interview aired that same day, even Putin appeared to fret.""What people can be afraid of in America, the very same thing can be a danger to us,"" Putin said. ""The U.S. is a high-tech country, NATO has declared cyberspace an area of combat. That means they are planning something; they are preparing something so, obviously, this cannot but worry us.""Both the U.S. and Russia have clearly asserted their right to wage cyber operations both offensively and defensively in the modern era. Until cyber boundaries are set, however, it remains difficult for foes to know when they've crossed them.Until cyber boundaries are set, however, it remains difficult for foes to know when they've crossed them.""We need to find what the red lines are, this continues to escalate, and we can't allow it to escalate,"" Shawn Henry, president and chief security officer of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told Newsweek. ""It's the exact reason we had nuclear arms talks, because we realize things couldn't continue to escalate, they couldn't spiral out of control. We couldn't worry about an adversary launching a weapon mistakenly because we know what the response would be.""The former FBI executive assistant director said now is the time for dialogue to avoid a catastrophic cyber event, one that could trigger a response that would have not only immediate but generational consequences.""It takes us back to that exact point in the conversation where nation-states need to sit down and define what the red lines are,"" Henry said, ""and what the responses are going to be says there's no misinterpretation, there's no misunderstanding.""

This story is available exclusively to Insider                             subscribers.                             Become an Insider                             and start reading now. Have an account? Log in. Marco Pirondini of Amundi Asset Management — which oversees $2 trillion in assets — told Insider that he believes the US government will move to regulate cryptocurrencies in a big way in order to protect the dollar's status, and that assets in the space, including bitcoin and ether, will not play a bigger role in the financial system in 10 years than they do today. His comments came as a slump in the crypto market deepened, triggered by a crackdown on mining in China that in turn revived speculation about the future of regulation in the US. The sell-off nearly halved the total crypto market cap from the start of this year to about $1.26 trillion on Tuesday June 22, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market cap, plunged below $30,000 and was down 50% from its peak in April.""I don't see any state that is willing to lose control over its own currency in favor of these other currencies,"" Pirondini said during a June 10 phone call. ""If [a cryptocurrency] is fundamentally existing outside of the framework of the government, I think they will really struggle to take off. And I think that the government will increase the legislation and the controls and will make them innocuous in time. Because government wants and needs control of the currency.""He added, ""Can you imagine the US not in control of the monetary policy? You really believe that the US will accept to not control its monetary policy?""Pirondini's comments follow similar remarks from Amundi CIO Pascale Blanque, who said regulators would be forced to ""stop the music"" on bitcoin. After falling by more than 50% from its record high in April, the world's largest cryptocurrency was up 37% this year as of Monday afternoon.  Pirondini said this regulatory storm has already begun around the world, highlighting that China has already taken steps to regulate the space and talks of regulation in the US are swirling in Washington. ""The world of these digital currencies that live outside the rule I think is coming to an end,"" he said.While he sees regulation hurting today's most popular cryptocurrencies, Pirondini said he thinks blockchain technology could end up being adopted by the US government and that a US dollar digital currency could come to fruition.Regulation a negative?Though Pirondini sees regulation as a potential negative for cryptocurrencies, many in the crypto world seem to welcome the prospect of regulation with open arms because it would legitimize the assets.""I 100% believe that regulation is a great thing for the space,"" Aya Kantorovich, the head of institutional coverage at crypto trading platform FalconX, told Insider in May.""It's not going to deter from any growth in the space, I should hope, and what we've seen in the new administration in the past is that there's been a lot more communication between the industry and the regulators back and forth, which I think is a really great sign.""Luke Lloyd, an investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, told Insider in February that while he thinks regulation around bitcoin specifically would spook investors in the near-term, it would be a positive longer-term.""Regulation would actually mean the government is acknowledging it and if they back it in anyway would help build more trust around it,"" Lloyd said. Still, he said in a message on Monday that he thinks there's a chance that smaller coins are outright banned. Bitcoin, however, is now too big for the government to completely shut down.Ultimately, the type and severity of any regulation the US government places on cryptocurrencies will determine their future viability.Countries around the world have taken different approaches to the digital assets so far. China has taken a hardline stance, banning banks from conducting business with bitcoin, silencing bitcoin social media influencers, and stopping bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, El Salvador last week became the first country to officially make bitcoin legal tender.

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeTuesday, June 15, 2021A transitory surge cools off.Two months ago it took only one thing to be rich.And that was a piece of lumber.Through the spring, the surge in lumber prices became the market narrative as it covered every pandemic-related trend: Labor shortages, shipping constraints and housing demand — all in one place.But now it looks like the latest mini-bubble to hit the market has started to pop, and offers us a preview of what's to come across the economy.On Monday, the lumber futures contract traded back below $1,000 per thousand board feet for the first time since late March. A level that is still elevated to be sure, but back in line with pandemic-era peaks seen in late summer 2020, and the early winter of 2021 (before the spring's epic short squeeze).Lumber futures are down almost 40% from their record high hit in mid-May as the latest mini-bubble within the economy cools off. (Source: Yahoo Finance)During the housing bubble, the futures contract for random length lumber never traded above $500 per board feet. But by early May, lumber futures were trading hands for more than $1,600 per board feet. This surge was adding as much as $36,000 to the cost of a new home; on average, new homes sell for around $400,000.So while Cathie Wood may have become the face of the pandemic stock market rally, actual wood had become the market's hottest trade.We've called this recovery the ""not enough"" economy as demand for almost everything — workers, vacations, dinner reservations, and so on — outstrips supply. Another way to slice this narrative is, as Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal has argued, to call this an economy facing a series of short squeezes.Used car prices, for instance, have been ripping higher as demand rises and supply is constrained. The used car market is, in essence, facing a short squeeze.So too is the global shipping market, as Insider's Rachel Premack outlined in a piece last week. And on the housing side, economist Ali Wolf told Bloomberg recently there's been something of a ""buyer's protest"" in the market as prices for single-family homes in the U.S. have exploded over the last year.Story continuesBut each of these markets — autos, shipping, housing, among others — has become imbalanced, because of one-time surges related to a dramatic and synchronized shutdown, and then re-opening the world's largest economy.When the Fed says inflation pressures will be ""transitory,"" what they mean is that prices across each of these categories facing short squeezes right now will start to make more sense.

Sharp price drops and increases create opportunities to make money. Qilin goes one step further by providing active exposure to the price swings of any asset. Enhancing Volatility as A Tool The vast majority of cryptocurrencies are only known for their volatility. Although that creates many money-making opportunities, it also scares off a fair few people on the fence about investing. While the volatile aspect of crypto assets can be scary, it is also a tool to wield by those brave enough to explore the options on the table. Harnessing volatility to one’s benefit can prove beneficial, as this industry is one of the only ones capable of providing such benefits. As the decentralized finance industry grows, the appeal of and access to unique opportunities becomes crucial as Qilin intends to create new opportunities through market volatility. More specifically, it is a decentralized volatility protocol that lets suers long any asset’s volatility over time. Exploring long or short volatility is an unusual option in the cryptocurrency industry, but it can prove useful.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  What is important for all DeFi solutions is how well they can handle significant blockchains’ scaling issues. Qilin is confident it has a 99.99% fee reduction over competitors and 50 times the capital efficiency. Bold statements to live up to, as users will scrutinize projects putting out such lofty features. With the mainnet launched on Ethereum in Q2 2021 and migration to layer-two solutions, later on, there are certain milestones to look forward to. As a decentralized volatility protocol, Qilin intends to reduce the risk of liquidity providers through Rebase Share. Additionally, its elastic liquidity supply range can help increase capital utilization, a very important aspect when dealing with market volatility and leveraged positions. Powered by a comprehensive liquidation engine, the team’s approach to derivatives is unique and can greatly appeal to the right type of users. A Successful Initial Round For Qilin A project on the scale of Qilin introduces a lot of opportunities but will also require careful development. Funding that development will not come easy, yet the team has raised $800,000 through its initial funding round. Contributions came from Fundamental labs, Multicoin Capital, Yuanyuzhou Ventures, and others.  All investors see merit in this unusual approach to derivatives and how it might impact the DeFi industry.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  With the help of this funding round, the Qilin team can explore the possibilities regarding the use of volatility as a trading instrument. The team deems volatility more important than altcoin liquidity, which is where its native mechanism comes into play. That mechanism offers decentralized on-chain risk control and dynamic liquidity. Both aspects will pave the way for permission-free on-chain contracts for altcoins. Closing Thoughts Until now, people sought exposure to volatility by using derivatives in the traditional sense. Going long or short on particular markets – with or without leverage – can yield significant results. However, it also requires using centralized platforms and service providers, which isn’t ideal when seeking exposure to decentralized assets and their market performance. The decentralization of the derivatives market is a big undertaking. By completing an initial investment round for $800,000, there seems to be a degree of institutional interest in what this project wants to bring to the table. Introducing a decentralized volatility protocol can pave the way for broader cryptocurrency adoption by mainstream consumers. It will also bring much-needed competition to centralized derivatives service providers, as derivatives remain an appealing option for anyone looking to gain exposure to volatile crypto assets.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                    ",2021-06-15

United States-based funds were most bullish about the new asset class, expecting to raise their portfolio exposure to crypto to 10.6% on average within five years.Their European Union- and United Kingdom-based counterparts gave a slightly more modest figure, although still significant: 6.8% on average. Intertrust’s sample included chief financial officers of funds that each manage an average of $7.2 billion in assets. The CFOs themselves personally expected to have a minimum of 1% of their portfolios in crypto.High-profile hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones have been vocal advocates of Bitcoin (BTC) amid concerns about inflationary tendencies in the economy.

It managed to reach a high of $41,101 before decreasing slightly.The main resistance area is found at $41,325. This is the 0.382 Fib retracement level and a horizontal resistance area. The next resistance above that is the 0.5 Fib retracement level at $44,775.Technical indicators are bullish. The MACD has just turned positive, the RSI is above 50, and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bullish cross.Despite this, a short-term pullback could occur prior to an eventual breakout.BTC Chart By TradingViewETHETH has been following a descending resistance line since May 19. The line has rejected the price five times up to this point.ETH created its first higher low on May 30 at the 0.618 Fib retracement support level at $2,182. It’s possible that it has been following an ascending support line since, which in turn would create a symmetrical triangle.The short-term MACD and RSI support a movement toward the resistance line and potentially could lead to a breakout.Despite this, it’s likely that the longer-term trend is still bearish.ETH Chart By TradingViewXRPXRP has been facing resistance at $1.04 since May 20. Since June 1, it has also been following a descending resistance line, which has so far rejected the price three times.On the other hand, the main support area is found at $0.80.The six-hour MACD and RSI are both increasing, supporting the possibility of a breakout.Therefore, it’s likely that XRP eventually breaks out and moves towards the resistance at $1.04.XRP Chart By TradingViewAAVEAAVE initiated a strong bounce on May 23 but has been falling since May 27. The decrease has taken the shape of a descending parallel channel, which often contains corrective movements.Story continuesOn June 12, AAVE reached the support line of the channel and bounced. It’s currently attempting to reclaim the midline of the channel.The short-term MACD and RSI are both bullish and increasing. Therefore, AAVE is likely to reclaim the middle of the channel and move towards resistance.AAVE Chart By TradingViewZECZEC has been increasing since bouncing on May 23. The bounce caused it to reclaim the $116 level, confirming it as support.However, ZEC has failed to move above a short-term descending resistance line that’s been in place since May 19.Following a rejection from this descending resistance, ZEC is in the process of creating a higher low just above the $116 support area. Doing so would be the first step in creating a bullish structure.However, technical indicators are neutral. A breakout from the resistance line could take ZEC towards $197.ZEC Chart By TradingViewMATICMATIC has been decreasing alongside a descending resistance line since May 18. It created a lower high on May 26 and is currently making another attempt at breaking out.The ongoing upward movement began after MATIC bounced at the 0.786 Fib retracement support level on June 12.Technical indicators are providing some bullish signs, such as the RSI movement above 50 and the first higher momentum bar in the MACD. However, the latter has yet to give a bullish reversal signal and the Stochastic oscillator has not made a bullish cross. Therefore, a bullish reversal is not yet confirmed.Despite this, both decreases since May 18 look like corrective A-B-C structure. Therefore, an eventual breakout is likely.MATIC Chart By TradingViewLINKLINK has been decreasing inside a descending parallel channel since May 26 after it reached a high of $35.41. On June 12, it created a higher low and bounced at the support line of the channel.It’s currently approaching the resistance line.The MACD and RSI are both increasing, supporting the possibility that LINK breaks out.

He spoke on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme monitored by The PUNCH. The Central Bank of Nigeria had in February 2021 ordered banks and other financial institutions to identify persons and entities operating cryptocurrency exchanges and close all such accounts. It also stated that dealing with cryptocurrencies and facilitating payments through them is illegal in the country. Speaking on Tuesday, Bawa backed the CBN move, saying it has assisted in limiting avenues through which criminals launder the proceeds of their crimes in the country.

Investors view bitcoin as the second most crowded traded (investors love bitcoin perhaps too much) behind being long commodities.A total of 224 fund managers with $667 billion in assets under management participated in the survey.To be sure, bitcoin prices have had a rough go of it lately as investors seemingly fixate on every bearish tweet from crypto influencer Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Bitcoin prices plunged roughly 37% in May, and are down 38% from their mid-April peak of $64,829.Is bitcoin a bubble despite recent crash?Prices have received a boost this week from bullish comments by money manager Paul Tudor Jones, who called bitcoin a good portfolio diversifier. At $40,000 though, bitcoin prices remain not too far removed from the early June lows of around $33,000.Meanwhile, others on Wall Street are warning the downside risk in bitcoin continues to be high.J.P. Morgan strategist and bitcoin expert Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou argued recently that medium-term fair value for bitcoin is in the $24,000 to $36,000 range.The analyst thinks the May crash in bitcoin has badly weakened institutional demand, which is likely to keep prices under pressure for the near-term.""There is little doubt that the boom and bust dynamics of the past weeks represent a setback to the institutional adoption of crypto markets and in particular of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We note that the mere rise in volatility, especially relative to gold, is an impediment to further institutional adoption as it reduces the attractiveness of digital gold vs. traditional gold in institutional portfolios,"" Panigirtzoglou said.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The valuation of the flash loan attack is estimated to be around $200 million. Termed as an “economic exploit” by the team, the incident took a massive toll on the project’s health, and its token BUNNY saw a 95% dump in price. Similarly, BurgerSwap, a decentralized automated market maker on BSC, lost $7 million through 14 transactions on 28 May. The hackers, as claimed by the BurgerSwap team, created a fake coin to initiate the attack. They then adjusted the routing to manipulate the prices and steal the funds. Furthermore, Belt Finance, a DeFi platform providing market-making solutions, lost a whopping $50 million to a flash loan attack. By creating a smart contract that uses Pancake Swap for loans, the hackers exploited the beltBUSD pool. And in 8 transactions, damage of $50 million, including a profit of $6.2 million, was inflicted.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609692 = window.pid609692 || rnd;                 var plc609692 = window.plc609692 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609692;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609692 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609692++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc476001 = window.plc476001 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc476001:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_476001_' + plc476001;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 476001,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_476001_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc476001++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609693 = window.pid609693 || rnd;                 var plc609693 = window.plc609693 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609693;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609693 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609693++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                  These attacks feature here due to recency bias.

Likewise, these headlines further fuel skepticism against the blockchain and DeFi community impeding the efforts being put in for their mass adoption.                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  All these factors culminate in questioning the amount of undue risk in the DeFi space with special emphasis on its security and integrity. With over $66 billion locked in DeFi, it is time the vulnerabilities in the DeFi space are solved in absolute terms. The CMO of Chainlink Labs, Adelyn Zhou stated that “flash loan attacks do not create vulnerabilities within DeFi – they simply reveal vulnerabilities that already exist.” This statement calls out the DeFi protocols that are still relying on centralized oracles. Looking at the modus operandi of the flash loan attacks, hackers place their bets on vulnerable centralized oracles to become temporary whales. This provides them the capital and the leverage to influence, manipulate, and siphon funds of gargantuan proportions. This leaves us with the conclusion that any DeFi protocol dependent on a sole price oracle is vulnerable to flash attacks. But, what if the trading infrastructure promoted the interconnectivity of the centralized exchanges? Then, oracles dependent on multiple exchanges, with volume and liquidity differences, can shield themselves against flash attacks. This is specifically what Flowdesk aims to achieve with their market-making infrastructure. By combining more than 40+ platforms, Flowdesk advances the interconnectivity of centralized exchanges. The Dire Need for Market-Making Between CEX and DEX The cryptocurrency market is fractured, and exchange platforms are scattered across the globe. Although we can see this as an advantage to crypto projects, more often than not, this dissociated liquidity comes at a crucial cost. Maintaining a project token’s liquidity is a must, and although DeFi helps projects manage their own tokens, the tools to apply these principles are missing on centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and Coinbase. To surmount these challenges, Flowdesk, a technological market-making company is aiming to bring liquidity to crypto projects across all platforms — CEXs and DEXs — 24/7. Their financial expertise coupled with their specialized market-making algorithms enables constant liquidity and healthy market conditions for the digital asset ecosystem that, in some cases, is extremely volatile. As the trend of Bridges, Swaps, and L2 protocols gets widely popular, it is important to maintain credible market conditions across every trading pair, on all protocols at all times. This helps prevent arbitrage opportunities that defer early investors from investing in projects. Liquidity and trust take time to build organically, and it’s mandatory for any project to survey their market. With Flowdesk’s constant market data aggregation and normalization, every project can have a global view of their market and an understanding of their market flow. This trust is also built with the help of the virtual assets service providers. As cryptocurrency becomes broadly accepted and known, its reputation still needs to be proven. Flowdesk aims to bring back trust into the digital asset ecosystem. As such, they are operating in France, the nation with one of the strictest regulatory frameworks, and are awaiting the deliverance of the Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) authorization from the French regulating authorities. While these frameworks can be seen as strict, they aim at protecting the end-users, who very often suffer due to the risks posed by the inferior quality of certain DeFi protocols. Conclusion Being an algorithm-bound market maker, Flowdesk is championing the upkeep of regulatory compliance. Not only are they infusing trust into the industry but their open-source culture is also promoting collective growth. Both these factors together contribute to making DeFi and the crypto market more healthy and trustworthy. With these attributes in place, their widespread adoption turns into a mere formality.   Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay ",2021-06-15

The official argued that despite Russia enforcing crypto legislation earlier this year, the Bank of Russia has been negligent, refusing to authorize local banks to offer crypto investment services.Tumusov said that central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina has been speaking openly about the bank’s reluctance to deal with decentralized cryptocurrencies, focusing on a state-controlled digital ruble instead. “Reluctance or not, this will not change the situation. It is necessary not to struggle with the reality but rather to adjust to it, to respond to the challenges of the time,” Tumusov argued.The lawmaker noted that many countries around the world offer clear tax laws and policies that allow the industry to develop. He stated that Russia needs methods to deal with crypto that aren’t just prohibitions:“Short-sightedness can be costly for Russia. Cryptocurrencies are the reality. Either we will accept it, or we will lose.”Related: Russian Bitcoin critic says he would have bought BTC for 100 rublesTumusov’s remarks on crypto come shortly after reports confirmed that major Russian banks such as private bank Tinkoff have been unable to offer crypto services due to the Bank of Russia’s tough stance on digital assets. Meanwhile, state-backed commercial banks such as Sberbank and VTB largely criticize the industry, claiming that they don’t like Bitcoin because it’s too risky.While Russian banks are hesitant to dive into digital assets, major crypto companies like Binance have established a presence in the country. According to a June report by crypto intelligence firm Chainalysis, Russia is ranked the fifth-largest country in the world according to its estimated realized Bitcoin gains in 2020, following the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom.

That’s a decent feat for the latter, which last hit a record on April 26.  Markets simply believe it is too soon for a Federal Reserve taper, as the central bank’s two-day meeting kicks off Tuesday. According to Bank of America’s latest monthly fund manager survey, 72% are buying the Fed’s line that inflation is transitory.  That doesn’t mean some investors aren’t still worried about this, that and the other. Our call of the day comes from Credit Suisse’s chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub, who offers reasons to stay bullish.  “Surprisingly, we find investors more bearish as inflation readings and declining yields dominate conversations,” he said in a note to clients that published on Monday. “Despite these issues, we remain comfortable with our 4600 [S&P 500          SPX,         -0.77%       ] year-end price target, which implies 8.3% upside.”  So here’s Golub debunking a few current investor concerns (in bold), with charts to back it up: Inflation readings such as last week’s on consumer prices and higher commodity prices could begin putting profit margins under pressure. “Our work indicates that companies are experiencing substantial pricing power which should lead to greater profitability despite higher input costs,” countered Golub.                     Credit Suisse               Some Fed officials have hinted of a readiness to start discussing tapering asset purchases, while rate-hike expectations have inched forward. In a review of rate increase cycles in 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2015, the bank found that returns were robust 12 months ahead of, and 36 months after the first rate increase, weakening only when the yield curve flattens.                      Credit Suisse               Also read: Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan is sitting on about $500 billion in cash, waiting to invest in higher rates Signs of declining bond yields in the face of higher prices could mean stagflation is looming. That is unlikely, with inflation largely seen as transitory and 10-year Treasury yield rate declines modest (5-year range 0.5% to 3.2%), said Golub.  Economic surprises have steadily fallen since mid-July, but the market keeps going up. Economic activity has improved during this time, and that is the “true catalyst of the S&P 500’s advance,” the strategist argued.                      Credit Suisse               Growth and earnings per share, both running high, could be about to roll over. “While the pace of improvement is sure to moderate, growth is projected to remain well above trend through the end of 2022,” said the strategist.                     Credit Suisse               While fiscal and monetary policy kept economies running throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, further help looks unlikely. “While further stimulus appears less likely (or will be reduced), we are less concerned given (1) an overheating economy; (2) less immediate impact of plan; and (3) higher accompanying taxes,” said Golub.

As ever, much of the misunderstanding was about the nature of bank capital. Many people confuse bank capital with reserves. Reserves are cash deposits at the central bank and vaulted currency. They enable customers to withdraw cash and make payments out of their deposit accounts. Without them, banks would have to go to the market for funding every time a customer withdraws money from their account. Banks famously don't keep enough reserves to enable all customers to withdraw all their funds all at the same time. Reserve requirements aim to ensure that a bank has sufficient liquidity to meet normal payment requests. The proportion of reserves to deposits that regulators require banks to keep is called the ""reserve requirement"", and it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and in some cases even from bank to bank. The most famous reserve requirement is the Federal Reserve's 10% of eligible deposits, which is the foundation of the well-known ""money multiplier"" model of bank lending. Sadly, it is no more. It was abolished in March 2020, superseded by the Basel Committee's liquidity regulations and additional Federal regulations such as living wills, and rendered obsolete anyway by the enormous excess reserve balances banks are carrying because of QE. But although fewer countries have formal reserve requirements now, banks these days are far more liquid than they were prior to the 2008 financial crisis. The risk that they will literally run out of money and have to close their doors is much lower than it was at the time of the run on Northern Rock. Banks also have far more capital than they had before the 2008 financial crisis. But capital is not about liquidity. It's about solvency. Capital requirements aim to ensure that banks don't become insolvent when asset prices fall or borrowers default. The whole point is to prevent any repeat of the taxpayer bailouts of 2008. I'm astonished how many people don't seem to know this. Capital is on the opposite side of the balance sheet from reserves. This is the basic balance sheet equation: Assets = Liabilities + equity Equity is not cash or assets. It is the difference between total assets and total liabilities. It is typically made up of shareholders' funds, retained earnings and general provisions. Bank ""capital"" is equity plus certain types of subordinated and convertible debt. Bank capital is often called ""loss-absorbing"" capital. This means that in the event of asset prices collapsing or bank loans defaulting, the bank's shareholders and junior bondholders bear the losses, not depositors, senior creditors, or taxpayers.* You could regard it as a form of collateral. If a bank doesn't have enough capital to meet regulatory requirements for the assets it holds, it must either dispose of some of the assets or raise additional capital. Raising capital could mean rights issues and/or issuing convertible bonds or some forms of subordinated debt. Deposits are not capital, and neither are senior bonds. Importantly, convertible and subordinated debt generally doesn't count towards the bank's core Tier 1 capital, the capital that is first in line to take losses. Banks can't borrow their way out of insolvency. Now to the Basel Committee's proposed capital requirements for crypto assets. The committee divides crypto assets into two groups:  Group 1: tokenised assets (Group 1a) and fully reserved stablecoins (Group 1b). The committee proposes a draft regulatory framework for these assets. Group 2: cryptocurrencies, algorithmic stablecoins, and reserved stablecoins that don't meet the capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements for Group 1b.  The widely-reported 1250% capital weighting applies to Group 2 cryptoassets. The Basel Committee has decided that because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and are highly volatile, the risk of total loss is considerable. Banks must therefore have sufficient capital to ensure that there is no risk of insolvency in the event of a total loss. That capital weighting looks wild, but is explained in this footnote to the Basel Committee's paper:  So, for banks that meet the Basel minimum capital requirement, the 1250% weighting is equivalent to 100% equity collateralisation of Group 2 cryptoassets. However, most banks nowadays have more capital than the 8% minimum. For them, the 1250% weighting is over-collateralisation. To give an example: in 2020, JP Morgan's capital ratio was 13.1%. Applying this to the Basel formula I tweeted earlier translates into a capital of $163.75 for every $100 of Group 2 cryptoasset exposure. That is significant over-collateralisation. This capital requirement applies to both short and long positions. There's also a recommendation that supervisors apply an additional capital requirement to short positions because potential losses are unlimited:   These capital requirements are by any standards draconian. They would make it prohibitively expensive for banks to take leveraged positions in cryptocurrencies. This might sound like a good thing - after all, it was the excessive leverage that caused the 2008 crash. But for banks, it amounts to banning them from holding or trading crypto on their own account. After all, leveraged position-taking is the entire business model of a bank: even in mundane retail banking, they fund their loan books by borrowing.** If they can't take leveraged positions, there is absolutely no point in holding or trading the asset on their own account. So these proposed regulations, therefore, amount to banning banks from holding or trading cryptocurrencies or stablecoins that don't meet Group 1 criteria. And in case this isn't clear enough, the BIS also gives supervisors the option of actually banning banks from holding or trading crypto on their own account:  So we can summarise the BIS's proposals regarding banks holding or trading cryptocurrencies and unregulated stablecoins on their own account thus: ""Don't do it. But if you do, put your own money at risk - not other people's."" But these regulations would not prevent banks acting as custodian for crypto assets, as some in the crypto community seem to think. Nor would they prevent banks holding and trading crypto on behalf of clients. They are only concerned with banks' own account activities. Proprietary trading, as it is usually known. These regulations also wouldn't prevent regulated banks acting as settlement banks for the fiat side of crypto transactions. However, AML/KYC regulations could still make this problematic. So, draconian though these proposed capital requirements are, they wouldn't completely prevent banks from participating in the crypto space. They could still offer custody, asset management, and settlement services for Group 2 cryptoassets. And the regulatory framework for Group 1 cryptoassets potentially opens the door to regulated stablecoins and tokenised assets becoming a regular part of the global financial system. The Basel committee specifically excludes central bank digital currencies from the scope of its proposals, but this regulatory framework could enable commercial banks to hold, trade, and issue fully-reserved stablecoins. Crypto is coming in from the cold. * I have considerably simplified capital requirements for the purposes of this post. In practice, losses might not be borne entirely by shareholders: subordinated debt holders might also suffer losses, and under some circumstances, holders of convertible bonds (""cocos"") can bear losses before shareholders are affected. ** Yes, I know banks create deposits when they lend. Deposits, even those created in the course of lending, are loans to the bank. Furthermore, when deposits created in the course of lending are drawn down, the bank must borrow to close the balance sheet gap. Loan books are therefore leveraged.

Which is why we’ve put together an easy-to-understand guide explaining the main terminologies that make cryptocurrencies work. From blockchains to crypto mining to P2P, here’s what you need to know about cryptocurrencies and how they work.Blockchain –It sounds complicated but at its core, a blockchain is nothing but a type of database. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems that are a part of the blockchain. The system records information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to hack or cheat the system.Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. Blockchain differs from other databases that record information because it doesn’t belong to anyone, it belongs to everyone who is part of the ledger.The data entered into blockchains can be decentralized, distributed, or centralized--depending on its use case. Bitcoin, for example, consists of thousands of computers, but each computer or group of computers that hold its blockchain is in a different geographic location and they are all operated by separate individuals or groups of people. This is an example of a decentralised blockchain. Because of its decentralised nature, all Bitcoin transactions can be transparently viewed by anyone with access to the blockchain.Crypto Mining – You must have heard Elon Musk backing off cryptocurrencies by talking about their carbon footprint caused due to mining.But what exactly is crypto mining?In simple terms, crypto mining means acquiring cryptocurrencies by solving cryptographic equations through the use of computers. This process involves validating data blocks and adding transaction records to a blockchain. The miner who successfully solves the puzzle is rewarded with Bitcoin once the encryption is validated by other miners, and this process is known as “Proof of Work’ (PoW).To mine virtual currencies, massive mining centers need to be set up that are capable of handling all the validation and processing. The electricity costs, depending on where an operation is located, can be enormous. Over 70% of Bitcoin mining happens in China, where dirt-cheap electricity makes mining computers extremely profitable. It is also why crypto prices slumped recently after China effectively banned crypto mining.P2P Networks – Think of P2P networks or platforms as a digital marketplace that connects interested buyers and sellers to transact with each other without the intervention of a third party and without a centralized entity or middleman. On a P2P platform, buyers and sellers can place their requests to buy a certain cryptocurrency. Once the order finds a match, the buyer transfers payment in the form of fiat currency (INR if you’re from India for example), and the seller confirms receipt whereupon the P2P network releases the order to the buyer. P2P networks, thus, work as a holding account of sorts to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers without requiring any documentation from either party.Buying Your Crypto On WazirX -If you’ve been toying with the idea of owning your first cryptocurrency and have no idea how to do it, here are two ways you can start with.1 - In the first step, we suggest you download the WazirX app or simply go to the WazirX website.Open your account and quickly complete the KYC process. This will then open the gateway for you to add funds in INR via bank transfer or P2P.Once the funds have been added, you can explore the Exchange tab and select from a variety of cryptocurrencies on offer on WazirX’s platform.Simply enter the amount of cryptos you wish to buy and hit Buy.Congratulations, you can now watch your latest investment in the Funds category.2 – You can also use the Quickbuy feature on WazirX’s app to buy and sell cryptocurrency.Open an account and complete the KYC process to add funds via bank payment or P2P. Check the Quickbuy tab in the app and select your preferred cryptocurrency.Enter your amount and preview your order before confirming.Once done, you can view your cryptocurrency assets in the Funds tab.While cryptocurrencies might sound a bit daunting at first, there is no getting around the fact that they are here for good. You might as well learn more about them right now and stay ahead of the game. And of course, invest in them as you see fit with the methods outlined above.Moneycontrol journalists were not involved in the creation of the article. ",2021-06-15

That price implied a market capitalization for Takung Art of about $17 million. Broadly speaking, that seemed correct. Takung Art offered, and still offers, an intriguing and unique business model. The company's platform provides fractional ownership of art, antiques, and collectibles to (mostly) Chinese consumers, along with ongoing trading of the units the company creates. Takung Art takes an initial listing fee (and a steep fee at that), while also generating revenue through trading commissions on the platform. The problem at the beginning of this year was that the business had headed sharply in the wrong direction. Revenue had plunged. Solid profits in 2016 and 2017 turned into heavy losses. A reasonable investor could debate the precise merits of the $17 million valuation, but barring a massive turnaround, even from such a tiny valuation Takung Art stock hardly looked like a so-called multi-bagger. So far in 2021, it has proven to be precisely that. At Monday's close of $19.42, shares have rallied 1,212% year-to-date. In even this crazy market, it's been the second-best performer on U.S. exchanges, trailing only AMC Entertainment (AMC) and actually ahead of GameStop (GME). The catalyst has been the supposed boom in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. In March, Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold an NFT for $69 million. Not coincidentally, Takung Art stock took off at the same time:  source: finviz.com From one perspective, the rally made sense, given Takung Art's end markets, its existing platform, and its presence in Asia. From another, however, the rally itself, and not just its size, seemed bizarre. Most notably, unlike PLBY Group (PLBY) or Topps (which is merging with Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation II (MUDS)), Takung Art never actually said it had plans to enter the space. In fact, the company said nothing at all: it still hasn't issued a press release in more than three years. Despite the company's silence, through the end of May, TKAT stock managed to maintain a decent chunk of the March gains. Then on June 1, the company disclosed in an SEC filing that it had invested in a company that ""engaged in the operation of an NFT platform related to collectibles."" Takung Art shares gained 24% on the news, and amid volatility since then are up about 13% from where they traded before the release. But the deal looks odd, to say the least, in terms of both structure and cost. Takung Art is paying a dear price for a small slice of a company that, as yet, does not appear to have an actually working product. The acquisition raises the question of how TKAT shareholders can profit from NFTs, even if the speculative pipe dreams come to fruition. Cultural Objects Provenance Holdings Limited (Author's note: the information taken in this section comes solely from Takung Art's recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as attempts to reach the company were unsuccessful. A representative of the investor relations firm currently listed on the Takung Art website confirmed there is no longer any relationship with Takung Art. That IR firm's website now consists of content that is absolutely not suitable for work. An email sent to the Takung Art corporate website bounced back; a phone call was not answered. Efforts to reach the company directly through other channels and to find more information on the nature of Takung Art's investment discussed herein are ongoing; updates will be posted in the comments if and when they are available.) Takung Art is investing in British Virgin Islands-based Cultural Objects Provenance Holdings Limited. According to the 8-K filed with the SEC, Takung Art is contributing:  $500,000 in cash; 282,000 restricted shares of stock in exchange for 54,100 common shares of COPHL; and another 290,000 unvested restricted stock (known as the ""Make Good Shares"") in exchange for 32,460 unvested common shares of COPHL.  There are two curious aspects to the transaction. The first is that Takung Art is investing in a company that has no product at the moment, at least not in the NFT space. We know this because one of the conditions of the investment is precisely that Cultural Objects complete ""an NFT platform for primary market sales."" (Cultural Objects also has to launch ""a physical exhibition / show [sic] with sales of collectibles"" using its technology.) On its own, this perhaps wouldn't be that unusual, as it might suggest that Takung Art is outsourcing the development of the platform and/or doing something along the lines of a so-called ""acquihire."" But there's another catch: Takung Art is buying just a small sliver of Cultural Objects. According to the Securities Purchase Agreement, COPHL has 1,352,450 shares outstanding. If the conditions are met, Takung Art would own about 6.4% of the company, as the SPA makes clear in section 2.3. Bear in mind that the consideration in cash and stock totaled $10,630,120 at the time of the SPA, and even more now (nearly $12.5 million at this writing). Cultural Objects has no apparent presence or history, and no existing NFT platform, yet the investment at the time of the agreement valued it at $166 million, with the current TKAT stock price moving the figure to nearly $200 million. It's difficult to imagine what aspect of the Cultural Objects business (to the extent to which it currently exists) supports that valuation, or even the contribution of such a healthy amount of stock. Even the cash payment is not immaterial for Takung Art, which at the end of Q1 had net cash of about $3 million, and burned nearly $8 million in 2020. So Many Questions Why, then, did this deal happen? There was no related party disclosure with the deal, so we have no evidence that anything is amiss ethically. Takung Art's downside is protected, certainly: no platform from Cultural Objects means no stock (or cash) from Takung Art, at least from my layman's reading of the contract. But the value being given away is rather high in terms of the dilution to existing shareholders. More importantly, if Cultural Objects controls the platform, it presumably controls the profits as well. In other words, the downside is protected, but the upside is sharply limited. Takung Art would see some benefit from a valuable platform, given 6.4% ownership. But this is a company whose market capitalization has increased more than $200 million year-to-date largely on NFT hopes; Cultural Objects would need to have a valuation of roughly $3 billion for this stake simply to support those gains. The questions go beyond the financial aspects. Why invest in a company based in the British Virgin Islands, when Takung Art itself is incorporated in the U.S. and according to the 10-K all of Takung Art's 24 employees are based in Hong Kong and mainland China? In fact, why invest in a company at all? Takung Art presumably could execute an equity offering; 572,000 shares, even at a discount to the late May trading price, would have raised in the range of $8 million, maybe more. That's roughly equal to general and administrative spending for the last two years total, and surely enough to at least begin to develop such a platform in-house. Why does ""an NFT platform related to collectibles"" even mean? Are Cultural Objects and Takung Art looking to make collectible NFTs, NFTs of collectible items, or (as the COPHL name suggests) a platform that helps authenticate the items? And why not art? For Takung Art, collectibles (which include sports memorabilia and what the company calls 'Unit+' products) accounted for just 14 of 295 listings at year-end 2020, again according to the K. Its legacy business was focused on art, and there would seem to be some value in its network of appraisers and selling agents in establishing provenance in its home region. If there is an explanation, logical or otherwise, Takung Art hasn't given one. In the meantime, even if the NFT craze has long-term legs, the deal seems to undercut its potential value for Takung Art stock. If TKAT's exposure to NFTs is limited to 6% ownership of what appears to be a startup, it's hard to see how that comes anywhere close to justifying the meteoric year-to-date rise in the stock. The Legacy Business Isn't Enough for TKAT Stock And if the NFT opportunity doesn't justify the rally, the legacy business can't, excluding a massive sea change in its performance. At one point, this was an attractive business. In 2015 and 2016, for instance, Takung Art generated nearly $12 million in net income combined at net margins above 40%. But the business has tanked, and the key problem has been that the company isn't generating much in the way of new listings. Just 10 listings were added in all of 2020. The novel coronavirus pandemic could be blamed - except the figure was just six the year before. As a result, listing fee revenue has collapsed to $816,000 in 2020 against $10.9 million in 2016. The loss of that revenue has crushed profitability. Gross margins were over 90% at the peak, and 50% in 2020. Operating loss last year was 34% of revenue, certainly an improvement from -115% in 2019 but still a long way from where it needs to be. It's difficult to assess exactly why that revenue has collapsed. Before 2018, when management was still in communication with the market, the company attributed the weaker revenue to strategic moves, notably around an effort to increase trading volume and liquidity by cutting commissions. (This third-party research report from 2018 offers a good overview of the efforts, which included plans to garner higher-quality artwork and the entry into collectibles.) At this point, however, it's painfully clear that the top- and bottom-line pressure isn't coming from a business 'reset'. Simply put, Takung Art isn't getting new listings onto the platform, and the trading of units in existing portfolios isn't close to enough to offset that problem. Q1 2021 doesn't look much better, with just three listings, revenue down another 34% year-over-year, and an operating margin of -76%. There's room for debate as to what the legacy business actually is worth. But it is nearly impossible to peg its valuation anywhere near the current market capitalization past $200 million. And if Takung Art owns a tiny slice of its NFT opportunity, the fundamental case here simply doesn't work. What To Do Now? Not that long ago, the fundamental issues here would have underpinned a seemingly solid short case. TKAT stock looks something like Eastman Kodak (KODK) in early 2018 or Tilray (TLRY) later that year: stocks swept up in bubbly optimism toward their sectors that would inevitably fade as the hype did. Takung Art stock has been treated as an NFT play; it's really not one, barring some kind of new business plan beyond the investment in Cultural Objects. Even if the company did release such a plan, its strategy would face a significant number of roadblocks, ranging from the Chinese central government's attitude toward cryptocurrency to the lack of access to Western markets to an apparent lack of any actual experience in the sector. Of course, shorting a stock such as this at the moment appears awfully dangerous. This is a low-float small-/micro-cap off 74% from its highs. Redditors aren't necessarily guaranteed to find the stock (and, for what it's worth, they've mostly been a ""Buy American"" bunch), but it wouldn't be stunning if they did. In this market, even the company's lack of commentary works in its favor - something that probably wouldn't have been the case even 12 months ago. Investors can assign Takung Art whatever potential they choose, whether that potential is real or even whether the company itself is looking to capitalize on it. This stock can stay up for a while. In fact, forced to choose, I'd bet it will stay up for a while. A brief look around social media shows a lot of retail investors who ""like the stock,"" and those investors can move a 6.4 million share float for some time.  But not forever. At some point, the legacy business needs to post profits or the NFT opportunity needs to have some validity. Right now, neither is the case, and the most likely outcome seems that neither ever will be.",2021-06-15

Sir Tim is partnering with Sotheby’s House for the auction. According to Sotheby’s House, the historical internet artefact will be up for bidding from June 23 to June 30, with bids starting at $1000. NFTs are all the rage right now, with artist Beeple’s digital art hitting the headlines after it sold for $69 million back in March. Beeple’s art titled “Everydays: The First 5,000 Days,” was auctioned by Christie’s, which did not reveal the name of the buyer. The auction for Sir Tim’s internet artefact is titled: ‘This Changed Everything’ and it will include timestamped documentation of his creation, thus making it a significantly high value item, especially for collectors of digital art. Given the work contains the invention of the world wide wide, there will be a lot of interest on this auction. Read our Sunday Eye Special On NFTs  | How a new platform may start the next big trend in the Indian art market — NFTs “Three decades ago, I created something which, with the subsequent help of a huge number of collaborators across the world, has been a powerful tool for humanity. For me, the best bit about the web has been the spirit of collaboration. NFTs, be they artworks or a digital artefact like this, are the latest playful creations in this realm, and the most appropriate means of ownership that exists. They are the ideal way to package the origins behind the web,” Sir Tim Berners-Lee said in a press statement. Money raised from the auction will go to initiatives that Sir Tim Berners-Lee and his wife support. Sotheby’s has also revealed that the NFT in question consists of four elements. It will have the original time-stamped files containing the source code written by Sir Tim, a visualisation of the nearly 10,000 lines of code, a letter written by him reflecting on the code and the process of creating it, and a digital “poster” of the full code created by Sir Tim from the original files using Python.Most Read  1 Vishal Bhardwaj thought Kaminey won’t work because nobody was getting along on set: ‘There was so much conflict…’   2 Ganapath box office collection day 2: Tiger Shroff-Kriti Sanon’s dead-on-arrival film fails to crack Rs 5 crore mark after two days   3 ‘SIM Swap fraud’: Delhi advocate receives 3 missed calls from unknown number, loses money from account   4 India versus New Zealand: Mohammed Shami has mastered the art of bowling out batsmen, like Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis did   5 Leo box office collection Day 4 early reports: Vijay’s film makes the best of first weekend  See More Advertisement It also includes the original HTML documents that instructed early web users on how to use the application.

The Bitcoin Mining Operation launched in May 2021 with the bulk of the initial mining equipment expected to arrive in September 2021.   * See NovaBlock for additional information on current and updated reward payouts. https://novablock.com/calculator **Based on Bitcoin price of $40,475.00 and a difficulty setting of 19932791027262.74 About The Graystone Company, Inc.

In other words, an artist sold something that doesn't exist for real money. There is even a Snopes write-up confirming the authenticity of this bizarre story that garnered national headlines.This transaction is dishonest and deeply troubling. Auction houses should not allow people to sell something that does not exist.The recent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) craze may be wildly irrational, especially the $69.3 million piece auctioned on Christie's, but NFTs are verifiable digital assets traded on blockchain technology. It's not invisible and non-existent; it's a digital asset like cryptocurrency. It may be worth nothing one day and is a highly speculative investment, but the consumer knows what they are buying.There is precedent for people trying to sell immaterial things.People have tried to auction their souls on eBay. The e-commerce website promptly shut down those attempts because the sellers can't deliver what they are promising. eBay also explained another reason why it forbids soul selling, stating ""if the soul does exist then, in accordance with eBay's policy on human parts and remains, we would not allow the auctioning of human souls.""  A woman walks in front of a digital painting by Chinese artist Liu Gang (back) at a crypto art exhibition. NICOLAS ASFOURI/AFP via Getty Images Auction houses should consider adopting policies similar to eBay prohibiting the sale of ""intangible items or anything a buyer can't confirm that they've received."" You can't confirm receiving something invisible that doesn't actually exist.While many people believe the soul exists, selling the ""invisible art"" sculpture was blatant fraud because it indisputably doesn't exist despite the ""certificate of authenticity"" the artist provided to dupe the buyer into proving that the ""air and spirit"" sculpture is real.The sculpturist defended his art claiming that, ""After all, don't we shape a God we've never seen?"" The problem with that analogy is that no one is selling God and even psychics selling fortune-telling services aren't claiming to be selling something tangible. A sculpture isn't metaphysical, God is.Several years ago, people fell for radio parodists Pat Kelly and Peter Oldring's hoax that the invisible art of Lana Newstrom was selling for millions of dollars. Unfortunately, invisible art sales are no longer a hoax, so perhaps auction houses should protect gullible consumers from getting conned.Eli Federman has written for Reuters, Time, New York Post, Daily News and elsewhere on religion, culture and law.

The common name for government money is fiat money, from the Latin word for decree, order, or authorization. Two important facts must be understood about government money from the outset. First, there is a very large difference between government money redeemable in gold, and irredeemable government money, even if both are run by the government.  This is important to know, as humanity is going to leave the gold standard behind. But the thing is, it was absolutely necessary for any currency to start with some form of backing. The second and often overlooked fact, is that, contrary to what the name might imply, no fiat money has come into circulation solely through government fiat; they were all originally redeemable in gold or silver, or currencies that were redeemable in gold or silver. And how did governments around the world managed to switch from one to the other? Well, World War I happened. Vaults were full of most of the citizen’s gold. The population dealt with paper money. This was crucial to the whole enterprise.  The ease with which a government could issue more paper currency was too tempting in the heat of the conflict, and far easier than demanding taxation from the citizens. Within a few weeks of the war starting, all major belligerents had suspended gold convertibility, effectively going off the gold standard and putting their population on a fiat standard, wherein the money they used was government-issued paper that was not redeemable for gold. The Gold Standard Was No Longer Functional According to the author, this form of indirect funding was the factor that allowed the war to last as long as it did. “World War I would have been settled militarily within a few months of conflict, as one of the allied factions started running out of financing.” In 1917, the United States intervened, the war ended, and “no victor could claim to have captured large territories worth the sacrifice. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up into smaller nations, but these remained ruled by their own people, and not the winners of the war.” The governments couldn’t admit their wrongdoings. “A fair market valuation of their existing stock of currency to their stock of gold would be a hugely unpopular admission of the depreciation that the currency underwent.” The solution was the creation of the system we live under to this day, “the value, supply, and interest rate for money now became centrally planned by national governments.” Related Reading | John McAfee Interview: ‘Bitcoin Will Become The Gold Standard’ After the war, the governments wanted “to return to the gold standard at the pre-World War I rates.” All sorts of decrees followed, but the damage was done and no country could keep their system together. The process and the policies emigrated from Europe to North America and culminated in The Great Depression. “What followed was the 1929 stock market crash, and the reaction of the U.S. government turned that into the longest depression in modern recorded history.” A North American Recovery Common core history says that President Hoover stood still trusting the free market to recover, and it was “Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who moved to an activist governmental role and suspended the gold standard.” According to Saifedean Ammous this is not accurate, and “there was nothing unique or new about the New Deal. It was a magnification of the heavily interventionist policies which Hoover had instituted.” With the population deprived of sound money, and forced to deal with dollars, Roosevelt then revalued the dollar on the international market from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce, a 41% devaluation of the dollar in real terms (gold). This was the inevitable reality of years of inflationism which started in 1914 with the creation of the Federal Reserve and the financing of America’s entry into World War II. Enter Keynes, who had “never studied economics or researched it professionally.” His theory stated that “the state of the economy is determined by the lever of aggregate spending.” Printing money was good, even though it debased the currency. Saving was bad, “government must do all it can to deter its citizens from saving.” The money kept losing purchasing power, so spending was the wise thing to do.  The governments were extremely happy with this interpretation. Keynesian economics was here to stay.  BTC price chart on Poloniex | Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com  ",2021-06-15

This story is available exclusively to Insider                             subscribers.                             Become an Insider                             and start reading now. Have an account? Log in. Now he has just closed his third fund, which is more than six times bigger than his first, for his venture firm 1confirmation. In four short years. Tomaino is now managing over $800 million in assets.On a June 1 episode of the ""Unchained"" podcast with crypto journalist Laura Shin, Tomaino shared his insight into investing in early-stage crypto companies and his outlook for the market.Investing strategyHis thesis is very simple, Tomaino said on the podcast.""Back authentic founders that have deep historical context on crypto, that are building products that we understand as users,"" Tomaino said.This is exactly how Tomaino ended up at Coinbase. On the podcast, he described the struggles of trying to buy bitcoin by going through the cumbersome process of going to an ATM to get cash out to then wire the cash to now-defunct crypto exchange Mt Gox via Western Union.""That was the best way to buy bitcoin at that time,"" Tomaino said. ""Then Coinbase came along, it was just this product that made it dead simple. That's kind of what drew me. We kind of let the products guide our investment thinking.""The philosophy is what helped him become one of Coinbase's first employees when it was still a private company.And it's a philosophy Tomaino sticks to. He currently looks to invest in bleeding edge technologies that are in the pre-seed or seed stage, typically writing checks of between $1 million to $3 million, he said on the podcast.Tomaino's portfolio also has investments in core cryptocurrency networks, such as blockchains like bitcoin, ethereum and polkadot.Crypto network investingInvesting in cryptocurrency protocols and networks can be challenging, with so many launching and all with their own positives and negatives.Most of the crypto companies Tomaino invests in leverage ethereum, which is a blockchain that powers a number of applications through its smart-contract functionality.""It's working really well,"" said Tomaino, on the podcast. ""But I'm not someone who thinks everything is going to happen on ethereum.""Ethereum has scalability challenges, which results in high gas fees and slow transaction times.An upgrade to ethereum 2.0 is set to resolve these issues and is expected to occur later this year.In the meantime, developers and investors are looking at alternative options.One is to bet on layer-two protocols. These are solutions that are built on top of the ethereum blockchain. They solve some of the scalability and speed issues, while allowing developers and projects to leverage the ethereum ecosystem.Some examples of layer two solutions are Polygon (MATIC) and xDai (STAKE).Tomaino said on the podcast he is skeptical on the potential of layer-two products.""I think just like in 2016, there are some promising initiatives at layer 2 that are bringing scalability to ethereum,"" Tomaino said. ""Some of that stuff may happen. It's probably going to take a lot longer than we think. ""Betting on layer-one protocolsAnother option is to leverage layer-one protocols, which are blockchains, such as ethereum and bitcoin. In recognizing ethereum's challenges, developers and crypto experts have rushed to launch new, or revitalize, layer one protocols that present solutions to ethereum's challenges.And while Tomaino expects ethereum to have the best chance of being the long-term winner in protocols, he highlights there are scenarios in which it's unlikely to be feasible to leverage this particular network.""I think if you're a crypto art marketplace, where people are buying pieces of crypto art for thousands of dollars, then paying $50 or $90 for a transaction is okay,"" Tomaino said. ""But for a $100 asset within a game or something, it's just not viable.""Polkadot (DOT) and cosmos (ATOM) are protocols that enable developers to create custom blockchains for bespoke products, which then communicate with other blockchains creating a multi-chain environment  that can still link in with bitcoin and ethereum.Polkadot's native token DOT is up around 200% year-to-date, while cosmos' native token ATOM is up around 127%.""We're very excited about other layer 1 chains like polkadot and cosmos that are bringing in new developers and enabling new use cases that ethereum simply can't support right now,"" Tomaino said.Many layer one protocols are still at a speculative phase, so it's hard to pick a winner, Tomaino said.The case for polkadotHowever, Tomaino finds polkadot exciting, because it's pushing the space forward by answering ""a hundred billion dollar question"" of how blockchains can create a type of decentralized governance that can actually evolve.No one has really done that, Tomaino said.""I would say what I like about polkadot — and particularly like the radical approach to on-chain governance — is this idea of a 12-member council that is making decisions,"" Tomaino said.Tomaino is excited about the idea of decentralized governance that gives power to the token holders, but can also evolve faster than the current governance minimization approach that's currently in most blockchains.""And that's kind of the promise of something like polkadot,"" Tomaino said. ""I think the polkadot governance is wildly unappreciated and unexplored.""Tomaino is not alone in betting on polkadot.British crypto VC firm KR1 has a similar take on the potential for polkadot based on their experience of the challenges of the ethereum network.Inside recently spoke to the co-founders of KR1, George McDonaugh and Keld van Schreven about their investment case for polkadot.Polkadot ""basically fixes a lot of the problems with ethereum,"" van Schreven said, adding:  ""Once you frame who created it and why, then that becomes important.""Like Tomaino, he is excited by the on-chain voting capabilities - the process for managing and implementing changes to the blockchain - in addition to polkadot being cheaper, faster and more developer friendly.""I think it's going to be one of the winners in the next few years, and then it's going to last for maybe 100 years,"" van Schreven said.Greg King of Osprey Funds also recently told Insider why he's bullish on the protocol.

I will shortly be handing you over to Chief Executive Brendan Horgan, and Finance Director Michael Pratt, who will take you through today's presentation. Before I do so, can I just remind you that this call is being recorded. During the call, all participants will be in listen-only mode, and at the end of the presentation there will be an opportunity for questions and answers. I'm now delighted to hand over to Brendan. Please begin your presentation. Brendan Horgan Thank you, operator, and good morning, and welcome to the Ashtead Group Full-Year Results Presentation. I'm speaking from our field support office in South Carolina. Joining online from our London office are Michael Pratt and Will Shaw. Today will be our fifth set of results under these virtual circumstances, but so far, I think we can agree the format has served its purpose. Before getting into the highlights of the year, I'll take this opportunity to extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to our devoted team members across all geographies and disciplines who have come through for our customers, our communities, our investors, and indeed for themselves and their colleagues. I hope they're proud of what they have accomplished together. And although I may be biased, I think it's been nothing short of remarkable. It's in this spirit that I'll turn to slide three, where I'll give a brief look-back on the year as it relates to our internal and external messaging and delivery with a consistent focus on our stakeholders. As we always have but perhaps amplified throughout this period, we defined our stakeholders and honed our focus, energy, and efforts on coming through for each with the aim to emerge in a position of improved strength. Beginning with our people, and we always do, we made their safety our first priority. And I'm happy to report a consecutive record year from a safety metric standpoint for our U.S., U.K., and Canadian businesses. During this period it was something every one of our team members had to stay focused on when distraction would have been easy. I will literally repeat the words I used last year at this time. Adjacent to safety is one's own wellbeing. And their career is an important part of this. From the outset of COVID-19, we were determined to safeguard these careers because under the circumstances, it was the right thing to do. Given team members across the business the comfort of knowing we were there for them. It's easy to be a great employer during good times; it's what businesses do during times of challenge that define their real character. This position we took and related decisions around working rules, special pay time off, et cetera, we believe were important early moves which were not only the right thing to do, but were material contributors to our performance and positioning moving forward. For our customers, we were there for them as essential service providers during these remarkable times. We quickly adapted to the new normal by leveraging our technology and scale to satisfy our customers' demands and requirements. Our customers were working to manage through these times, and we were right there with them. We experienced what I characterize as a flight to quality. Not only during the earlier pandemic times, but increasingly as it relates to partnering on upcoming projects and events, many of which involve sustainable solutions, something that will be a key differentiator in the years to come. For our investors, in a way it's simple. The actions taken by and for our people and our customers allowed us to outperform the market by maximizing opportunities. Throughout this period, we designed and launched a renewed strategic growth plan, quickly reduced leverage to just below the low end of our range, put in place a new buyback program, and increased our dividend for the 16th consecutive year. As we begin the new financial year we'll remain focused on delivering for all our stakeholders and taking advantage of the exciting growth opportunities we see. So, let's get on to some of the more straightforward highlights for the year, on slide four. The highlights pickup where we left of in March, with our Q3, and trading updated in conjunction with our capital markets day, in April, perhaps with a bit more momentum. Our market-leading performance in the year shows the strength of our model. This has been demonstrated during good times, but now proves itself equipped during more challenging times of an economic cycle. The business delivered PBT of Â£1 billion and record free cash flows of nearly Â£1.4 billion in the year, contributing to lowering our leverage to 1.4 times net debt to EBITDA, a desirable place to be with the momentum we are experiencing in the business today. In a year where agility mattered more than most, we went from pausing our greenfield and bolt-on program in the early months of the pandemic, to opening an industry-leading 29 greenfields in North America, and returned to bolt-ons, completing five in the fourth quarter. Together, these actions and results put us in a position of strength as we enter our strategic growth plan, Sunbelt 3.0. In April, we announced our latest buyback program of up to Â£1 billion over the next two financial years. And I'm incredibly happy today to announce our proposed final dividend of Â£0.35, which will amount to a full-year increase of nearly 4%. This should demonstrate the confidence we have in our business and the future, while recognizing the cash generation in the year. I'll turn now to slide five to cover our initial fiscal '22 guidance. Consistent with our approach in the reported year, the slide frames our current estimate of the year-on-year revenue change by business unit in their respective currency, as well as Group level CapEx and free cash flow. Beginning with rental revenue, we anticipate the U.S. to be in the 6% to 9% growth range, Canada to deliver growth of 20% to 25%, and the U.K. to grow 5% to 8%. From a CapEx standpoint, we begin the year with a range of Â£1.37 billion to Â£1.54 billion, all leading to a free cash flow in the Â£600 million to Â£800 million range. We will update this on a quarterly basis as we progress through the year. On that note, I'll now hand it over to Michael to cover the financials in more detail. Michael? Michael Pratt Thanks, Brendan, and good morning. The Group's results for the year ended 30, April, 2021, are shown on slide seven, and show a strong performance with all businesses showing healthy growth in the fourth quarter. Group rental revenue increased 1% on a constant currency basis, which is a remarkable achievement given the backdrop. However, while for the year as a whole, revenue has increased, the lower activity levels earlier in the year had an impact on margins. This reflected, in part, our decision not to make any team members redundant as a result of the pandemic, not to reduce pay level, nor take advantage of any government support programs. Moreover, throughout this time, we continue to invest in the business, including our technology platform and our rental fleet. Furthermore, in addition to not reducing pay levels, we continue to pay bonuses, made additional discretionary payments to our skilled trade workforce as mark of thanks for their hard work and dedication in challenging circumstances, and increased wage rates in response to an increasingly competitive labor market. As you saw at our capital markets day, one of the core principles of Sunbelt 3.0 is to lead with ESG. While understandably the focus is increasingly on the E, the S is critical to our business. And more importantly, it is part of our culture. This is evident from the dispositions we took during the year surrounding our people. While there was drag from decisions we took for the long-term benefit of the business, the EBITDA margin was still healthy at 46% and with an operating profit margin of 24%, adjusted pretax profit was Â£1 billion and earnings per share were 166 pence. Turning now to the businesses, slide eight shows a performance in the U.S., rental and related revenue was 2% lower than last year at $4.9 billion. As we discussed previously, we took an early decision at the onset of the pandemic to protect our most valuable assets, our people and our fleet. Our average fleet size was slightly larger this year than last year. Furthermore, we continue to invest in the business, particularly in our technology capabilities. While this approach had an adverse impact on margins, it has been more than vindicated by our significant market outperformance as we take share. There are a lot of moving parts in the numbers this year as illustrated in the fourth quarter, both in absolute terms and relative to last year. This year, the fourth quarter benefited from a reduction in our allowance for doubtful debts whereas last year, we increased this allowance in the fourth quarter, due to our concern over increased levels of irrecoverable receivables due to the pandemic. However, this did not materialize and cash collections have remained strong throughout the year, and particularly in the fourth quarter. As a result, only 50% of the reduction in rental revenue dropped through to EBITDA in the year. Margins were also affected adversely by used equipment sales. While secondhand volumes remain healthy overall, our proceeds were affected by both the type of assets sold and the sales channel selected for disposal. Despite these factors, the EBITDA margin was still healthy of 49%, operating profit was $1.44 billion at a 27% margin and ROI was 20%. Turning now to Canada on slide nine, rental and related revenue was 21% higher than a year-ago on a reported basis at $436 million. This includes the benefit of William F. White acquired in late 2019. On a more comparable basis, excluding White's rental revenue was 3% lower than a year ago. he White's business was severely affected by the pandemic but has bounced back strongly since production resumed in the autumn last year and revenue was fourth quarter record for the business. These factors contributed to the White's business generating a profit of $29 million in the year and enhancing overall Canadian margins. That said, we've seen improvements across the Canadian business. The Legacy Canadian businesses EBITDA margin excluding White improved to 43% and it generates an operating profit of $69 million at an 18% margin. These margins are in line with our initial goal for the Canadian business of 4% and 20% and the operating profit is better than last year's $54 million. This is impressive performance in this environment and demonstrates strong cost discipline in what is still an immature business, which does not yet have the benefit of well developed clusters, or the depth and breadth of our full range of specialty businesses. Turning now to slide 10, U.K. rental and related revenue was 18% higher than a year-ago of Â£481 million. This was a strong performance of the breadth of our product offering and commitment of our team members enabled us to support all our existing and new customers and provide essential support in the national response to COVID-19. Our support for the Department of Health accounted for around 29% of revenue, with a large proportion of this relating to the services we're providing in support of the rental. Turning out to the cost base, this reflects our continued investment in the operational infrastructure of the business as part of Project Unify and the cost of service to the Department of Health test sites. Our investment in the operational infrastructure includes a charge of approximately Â£10 million to reshape the operating footprint of the business taken in the second quarter. This was taken as an impairment charge and is included within depreciation for the year. These factors resulted in EBITDA margin of 30% and an operating profit margin of 10%. As a result, U.K. operating profit was Â£61 million and ROI recovered to 10%. Slide 11 sets out the group's cash flows for the year. This slide tells a powerful story and demonstrates the strength of our business model. We have maintained a strong focus on working capital management, particularly the collection of receivables, which has resulted in cash flow from operations of Â£2.3 billion. This combined with a decisive action we took to reduce capital expenditure resulted in record free cash flow of just under Â£1.4 billion. It's important to recognize that while we reduced our capital expenditure this year significantly, this has not been at the expense of the future. We have executed in our fleet disposal plan as intended. But with lower demand overall, we replaced only highly utilized assets and spent the balance on growth assets where demand was high, particularly within our specialty businesses. This is where we get the phrase ""Growth disguised as replacement"" when talking about capital expenditure. That said, as you can see, in the middle of the slide, we've spent absolute growth CapEx in the period, which has been to meet demand service in the Department of Health in the U.K., and in our Canadian lighting and grip business, resulting in fleets larger than they were a year ago in the U.K. and Canada. Slide 12 update our debt and leverage position at the end of April. We use the cash generated in the year to reduce that and leverage which at 1.4 times excluding the impact of assets that's being within the bottom of that target range. This benefited from our strong and expected earnings performance and fourth quarter cash collections. To put this into context, as you can see from the chart on the top right, this is as low as leverage has been in April in the period since 2012, and in reality, since long before then. This point is worth dwelling on. Never had the flexibility of our model been more clearly demonstrated than in this year of adversity. Our ability to flex capital expenditure down at short notice and generate significant free cash flow against an adverse market backdrop has enabled us to reduce leverage consistently through the year from 1.9 times a year ago to 1.4 times by the end of the year. This is the strength of the model. Looking forward to '21, '22 we expect leverage to be in the lower half of our target range of 1.5 to 2 times. As we've said on many occasions, this strong balance sheet and flexibility gives us a competitive advantage and positions as well for the future. It's important to recognize that this has been achieved, while we've continued to invest in the business through retaining our people, investing in our technology capability, Greenfield openings, additional capital expenditure to both support the pandemic response and take a bunch of growth opportunities and Â£125 million spent on bolt-ons. It is disposition of strength that has enabled to outperform the market and take share. Our debt facilities are committed for an average of five years at a weighted average cost of 4%. Both our leverage and well invested fleet continue to provide a high degree of flexibility and security and enable the business to be on the front foot as we embark on Sunbelt 3.0. As you will see from our results announced on this morning, we are changing our reporting currency for the coming financial year to report in U.S. dollars. Slide 13 shows this year's results and last year's as they would have been if we had been reporting U.S. dollars. We put out a separate press release this morning that provides additional detail with a five-year track record and quarterly splits for the year we've just completed. Reporting dollars makes sense for the business as our reporter results will reflect more transparently the underlying performance of the business and reduce reported earnings volatility due to currency fluctuations. We made this change effective from 1 May 2021. And so our first results reporting U.S. dollars will be for the quarter ending 31 July, 2021, which we are due to release on September 16. We will declare future dividends starting with the interim dividend for next year in U.S. dollars and pay them in Sterling and based on the prevailing exchange rate shortly before payment. Shareholders run options received in dots. Before I hand back to Brendan, it will be remiss of me not to thank the finance team for the enormous effort involved in enabling us to report in U.S. dollars. When you read the detail, you will see that this has involved restating our results from 1 May 2004 onwards. No simple exercise. So, thank you. Brendan. Brendan Horgan Thank you. Michael will now move on to some operational and end-market detail beginning on slide 15. I'm encouraged to report it returned to growth in Q4 within our U.S. general tool business. Rental revenues were 7% better than last year. You may have expected growth in the quarter given the comps, but worth noting, we have also eclipsed pre-COVID 2019 levels in general tool. Our specialty business delivered another noteworthy quarter, delivering 18% growth year-on-year. Bear in mind, this is growth on top of growth as we never took a step backward leading up to or during the pandemic. This performance demonstrates on a full-year basis, the diverse makeup of our business and the tangible effect, the uniquely powerful cross selling capabilities our model delivers. The bottom right graph on the slide depicts how well the rental industry has managed supply through the period. The industry entered the pandemic with a fleet 9% larger than the previous year to a fleet size 3% smaller today. To state it clearly, the current supply and demand equation is as good as it's been for years. This dynamic coupled with our gain and market share over the period has led to current record levels of utilization across many of our operating regions. Further setting the stage for what has been promising sequential rate movement in late spring and early summer. These are good conditions. These conditions will of course be shaped in part by the end markets we operate in. As we turn to slide 16, we cover the ordinary set of construction and rental industry forecast. Before covering, I'll remind you that construction while our largest market is less than half our business. However, it remains a meaningful desirable and important part of our end market. So we'll cover in some detail. Not surprisingly, construction starts are expected to recover in 2021, reaching pre-COVID levels by 2022 and growing through 2025. These starts and put in place figures are supported by residential construction, which has been a positive surprise throughout the year, and showing no signs of slowing. Leaving the remaining non-residential component from a put in place standpoint, forecasted to decline in 2021 before returning to pre-COVID levels in 2023, these are the most current forecast time will tell as to their accuracy. The current activity levels we are experiencing in the business, which I covered on the previous slide aligns with the positive Dodge momentum index, which is at its highest levels since 2007, and the strong ABI figures. Importantly, we can say the same for our business and non-construction segments, such as MRO, emergency response, and the very early return to live events. There seems to be an abundance of momentum in the markets. As I said a moment ago, these are good conditions. Turning now to our business units outside of the U.S. beginning with Canada on slide 17, as Michael covered, our Canadian business performed well, considering the difficult conditions, the year abroad. On an underlying basis, meaning without William F. White, our pure rental revenues declined only 2% while delivering record profits and margins; undoubtedly, noteworthy, outperformance of the broader Canadian market. Our ongoing focus on advancing the beginnings of our clustered markets in Canada and the establishment of our specialty business platform is showing positive early results. Part of this specialty business is of course, our lighting grip and studio business, William F. White, who gained share in the period and the exciting film and production space while advancing cross-selling winds with a broader Sunbelt product lines. This business delivered the best quarter of their 50-year history. As we've said for some time, our runway for growth in Canada remains long. Moving on to slide 18 to cover Sunbelt U.K. The business has executed well throughout Project Unify and is carrying great momentum producing advancement and wins on many fronts and is now poised to enter Sunbelt 3.0 to deliver on the longer term objectives laid out during the CMD. The outperformance in the year was a combination of COVID response efforts and the ongoing gains as well as positioning in the broader construction infrastructure, maintenance and events markets. Let me be clear. This has been a year of progress in the U.K. business. To add definitive context, our current fleet on rent levels, excluding that on rent to the NHS is greater than pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Some about U.K. continues to support over 500 NHS COVID testing sites. At this stage, we are fully in the maintenance and ongoing services phase. We are unclear as to the remaining duration and site count implications, but anticipate some level to be ongoing through the coming winter. I'm sure we can all agree that we look forward to the time when these sites are no longer necessary and are given the order to demobilize. Infrastructure work remains active in areas such as utility, telecom and highway. And our relationship with Tier 1 contractors that cover the infrastructure and commercial construction segments remain strong as we retreat routinely service their needs over the year. Cross-selling inside the business has been a very tangible outcome of the Unify efforts, and has led to good wins and absolute as well as share of wallet across a broad makeup of customers. As you will know, live events sector was a material driver of a number of our specialty business lines, which went to virtually zero in the early days of the pandemic and has largely stayed there until just recently. We are seeing the beginning of certain events returning. A current example is the G7 Leadership Summit last week. We provided accommodation units, fencing barriers, solar light towers, electric bikes, power generation and foreign products. This is a carbon free event, meaning all of our products are either powered by renewables such as solar or HBO fuel. Having delivered on an event like this, positions us well across the group with our events partners, particularly as they move toward a low carbon agenda. This is an exciting space, which Sunbelt will surely lead the way as live events return, which they are beginning to. Moving on to our fleet plan for the year on slide 19, this is consistent with our initial guidance given with our Q3 results in March. Our CapEx levels are anticipated to return to levels similar to fiscal 2020. On the slide, you will see the component parts of the guidance I gave at the front of the presentation by country and between rental and non-rentals spend. Our usual and extensive fleet planning exercise carried out last fall and early winter proved more important this year, as the supply constraints are significant, as OEMs work through supply chain and workforce challenges, while ramping back up their production levels. To our partnership with the world's leading manufacturers in our space, and early engagement to secure our build slots was more vital than many previous years. We're in a good position to receive delivery in accordance with this guidance. Although, I will say that the exercise is far more complicated than putting numbers on a slide. The landings and disposals of fleet both by composition and geographic allocation will be fluid as we progress through the year. Our ability to navigate this through experience, utilizing technology and real time analytics, I believe will be an advantage during this critical period. I'm going to transition here from results to our strategic growth plan unveiled during our capital markets event in April. Most of you watched our virtual event live or took in the replay at some point. However, I thought it would be worthwhile to do a flip through this morning of the key deliverables. Turning to slide 21, the construct of Sunbelt 3.0 can be summarized with these five strategic actionable components. We're planning to do a deeper dive into one of these at a time in conjunction with future quarterly results. However, I will briefly touch on each one now beginning on slide 22. We will grow our general tool business with a focus on advancing our cluster market strategy. We have set our sights and formed a detailed plan to achieve cluster status and 49 of the top 100 DMAs, where we will deliver heightened service to our customers while achieving the financial benefits, also known internally as cluster economics. You will notice we're off to a good start. We've opened 12 green fields and completed to bolt-on acquisitions, which added a further four locations all in just the first six weeks of the financial year. Slide 23 illustrates our specialty business roadmap from a revenue and rental penetration standpoint. I cannot overemphasize the work that went into this, specifically, the market sizing and rental penetration levels by specialty business line, and then utilizing this information to develop detailed plans to deliver a combined specialty business with Â£2.4 billion in revenues by fiscal 2024. We view this three year plan as a milestone, not an endpoint as we see a path of business exceeding Â£ 6 billion over time. Let's turn to slide 24. Andy Wright and Phil Parker covered with you our 3.0 plans for the U.K. during the CMD. In keeping with the strategic theme we set course on nearly two years ago, I'll summarize the slide by stating that theme, and understood business model leveraging the strength of our diverse product offering to bring service to our customers unmatched in the U.K. market and by extension, delivering long-term and sustainable margins, cash generation and returns and a business we can be proud of. This is what the Sunbelt U.K. team has been doing and I'm confident they will deliver through 3.0. Moving to slide 25, we covered in more detail than ever before our technology ecosystem during the CMD. It's difficult to do our technology plans inherent in 3.0 justice on a single slide. So I'm simply summarizing three primary areas of development, customer experience, order capture and fulfillment and dynamic pricing. Our technology capabilities are a differentiating factor, very much visible to our customers and core to driving improved efficiencies within our operations. Slide 26 covers our actionable component to lead by way of ESG. We set course to reduce carbon intensity 35% by 2030, and more near-term milestone of 15% by 2024. This is a commitment we take incredibly seriously and have resources in place to deliver. It's also important to understand how ESG particularly environmental and social serves as a catalyst to advance rental penetration across the vast product lines and our vital role in making this a reality, perhaps the E gets much of the attention, but we must not dismiss the S, particularly in the business made up of skilled trade workforce, whether it be health and safety at our locations and the broad and diverse sites we service 1000s of times a day, or the importance of career advancement opportunities, training, leading wages and benefits. To deliver on these things, a business must possess the culture, infrastructure, financial resources and supporting cast. Our actions surrounding the E, S and G are clear. This leads us nicely into capital allocation on slide 27. It is our fifth actionable component. But I'll cover here along the lines of our priorities and as they remain unchanged should come as no surprise. Throughout the year, we invested in existing location and Greenfield fleet additions and in Q4, return to bolt-ons after a COVID driven temporary pause, our returns to shareholders through the earlier covered proposed final dividend and buyback program, all-in keeping within our stated leverage range. To conclude, let's turn to slide 28. This has been a year of outperformance throughout all of our geographies and equally a year of positioning for future sustainable growth and success. Our model has demonstrated for years the ability to thrive during good times and we can now see clearly that during more challenging periods in the economic cycle, rental, and in particular, our unique approach between general tool specialty and clustered markets is designed to deliver a reliable alternative to ownership to an ever broadening line up of end markets. This increasing propensity to rent, combined with our ability to gain market share enables us to perform strong and a broad range of market conditions. Our business has embarked on another phase of ambitious growth. Sunbelt 3.0 is clearly defined and understood, given us a roadmap to benefit all of our stakeholders as we continue to grow this exciting business. The scale of our business is now such we can fund strong organic growth, while continuing to generate positive free cash flow, which provides immense flexibility within our long-term leverage range. For these reasons, and coming from this position of increased strength, we look to the future with great confidence. And with that, Operator, we'll turn it over to Q&amp;A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Brendan, thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]Our first question today is from the line of Jane Sparrow of Barclays. Jane, your line is open. Please go ahead. Jane Sparrow Good morning. Two questions, please. Are you able to provide a bit more color on what promising means when you're talking about sequential rate increases, perhaps if not an exact number there, maybe are we talking sort of low single-digit, mid-single digit, so just a bit more color there? And then perhaps following on from that, the 6% to 9% U.S. rental revenue growth that you're targeting for the full-year, what are you factoring in there for rate? And given supply chain constraints, is it fair to say that potential upside to that number is more like to come from rental rates and M&amp;A, rather than additional organic CapEx give it's hard to get hold of equipment at the moment? Brendan Horgan Sure. Good morning, Jane. In terms of color on rate, I would say this way, when we look at our, as I said promising, sequential rate movement in April, and then again in May, we have to go back to 2014 to put together two months where we had as much sequential movement as we experienced. Look, I've shared I think on stage during CMD, when we look at our internal targets, not to be confused with budgets or guidance, we've challenged the business to have rates 5% higher this coming April than they were last April. Now, will that come true? Time will tell. I do think from an overall supply and demand standpoint, we are poised to deliver that. And I would just say the momentum in those first two months would amount to that if we were able to deliver. Again, time will tell. In terms of our guidance at 69% and your point in terms of what's baked into that from rate. As I said, the 5% is not baked into that. We have a bit of rate, but nothing extraordinary in that guidance. But your point on how we could exceed that is a really good one. We outlined our CapEx guidance, and we've worked, as I said, with our OEMs to secure those build slots. This may just be one of the years that, as ambition and driven -- as ambitions and driven as our team is, we maybe couldn't spend more than what we've given guidance on through our OEMs. And if we did, it's likely to come late in the year, not earlier. So, we're managing disposals, as I said, in order to satisfy the demand we have, which as I noted, many of our regions are now posting record levels of time utilization. So, yes, more of that outperformance would then come by way of rate and the bolt-on M&amp;A activity, which we've already gotten off to a good start. Jane Sparrow Thank you. Operator Thanks very much. Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Rob, your line is open, so please go ahead. Rob Wertheimer Hi, good morning, everybody. It seems like the last year was one where you took a pretty good step forward relatively to the whole universe of competition, whether it be from the technology initiatives that you've put in or keeping the labor force, move the cash flow that allows you to sort of by fleet. So I guess what I want to ask is sort of competitive question, I'll ask it from the lens of labor. What do the labor markets feel like right now? Do you anticipate that you'll have any trouble hiring for the growth that you have? And obviously, the moves you made were supportive and probably fresh into that rebound we've had? And then just any comments on, generally, the competitive gap as it exists, either through that lens or anything as we kind of return to growth in the industry and you guys are ready for growth? Thank you. Brendan Horgan Sure, thanks, Rob. From a -- look, let's just address skilled trade workforce. It's -- I mentioned it in my covering of the slides there. And if you look at things like even [Dodge Momentum] [Ph], let's just say, and you read about that, and some of the challenges that are being faced in the market. And certainly attracting and retaining, probably the latter being the primary, is challenging for many. We are seeing evidence that our decisions throughout the year have retained our workforce well. But we're being very proactive. And by that I say that -- now, I've not shared this externally until just this minute, but actually, Monday, the 21st, we are putting forth a increase to our skilled trade workforce of $1.25 an hour for every single person. And when you do the math around that from a base wage standpoint and an anticipated overtime, you're talking about the $300-a-month increase in their take-home pay, and $3,600 a year. I say that because in no way, shape, or form were we behind the times. We have a leading wage philosophy in the business. And we are certainly experiencing and recognizing the inflationary environment when it comes to wages. But we're taking a proactive step. Now, will we get all of that back in a quarter's time? Of course, we won't, but we need to do that. The other part of that is not just the pay; it's the environment that we are focused on creating, part of which is actually technology. And through that technology it created an improved work environment for our skilled trade team members, whether it be in our shops, it be in our drivers who are making our deliveries and pickups, or be our field service techs who really want to have that technology, particularly today as you're hiring the sort of younger entrants into this space. They expect that to be at the palm of their hand, whether it schematics for a piece of equipment or a very simple way to phone a friend, so to speak, in terms of reaching out to our command center, our central command center where our central technicians are helping them. So, what does that mean from a competitive landscape standpoint? I think really most importantly it -- these things are ingredients to or catalyst for an increase in rental penetration. And in the end, that's really what it's all about. We're clearly confident that we will take our, let's -- somewhere between fair share and unfair share of what that brings, and we're positioned to do that, not just in our general tool business but our specialty as well. So I hope, in general, that answers your question, Rob. Rob Wertheimer That does. Thank you, Brendan. Operator Okay, thank you. And our next question is from Annelies Vermeulen, Morgan Stanley. Annelies, your line is open, please go ahead. Annelies Vermeulen Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions, just a couple from me. So, just a clarification on the store openings so far, obviously at the CMD the plans that you announced basically implied two openings per week. You mentioned 16 greenfields since the 1st of May, which would imply a very good start. And were those all in general tool or were there some additional specialty on top of that as well? And if you could talk a little bit on how the pipeline looks over the coming couple of months, that would be helpful. And then secondly, on the market for deals, you've obviously done a return to bolt-on deals earlier in the year. And I'm just wondering what the market for deals looks like, now that the U.S. economy has opened up a little bit more. Is there, are you seeing more opportunities, better multiples? That sort of seeing any comments on that would be helpful. And, then perhaps just one more on the very strong growth that you reported in specialty, I'm just wondering if there's any particular segments within that, whether it's HVAC or flooring or whatever that has driven those in particular? And what is driving that? Any comments on that would be helpful. Thank you. Brendan Horgan Sure, thanks, Annelies. In terms of our cadence or pace for greenfield, yes, during the capital markets we said we would end the year at about 936 locations, and add 298 to get to our 1,234 location by April of 2024. That was not exactly linear, if you will, in terms of our plan. So, we're a bit ahead of pace of -- for the first year. The first year, I think had a plan of about 90 greenfields, and then we pick up that pace in year two and year three. Clearly, we've entered with a good clip. Not to mention we actually finished a bit ahead of that 936 at the end of the year. So, good pace there, and I would expect that to continue. In terms of makeup, if you look at those added by way of greenfield and bolt-on, it was 50-50. So, the greenfields were biased to specialty, and the bolt-ons just so happened to be general tools. So, that start [eight in eight] [Ph] in the six weeks. In terms of markets for deals, it's a really good question. And I think there are a few things that come into play. Certainly the pipeline is strong. The active dialogue that our business development team, you will have all met Kurt Kenkel during the CMD. Kurt is a busy man, so he's in lots of conversations with perspective suitors. The business development team is also very active in planning for integrations, et cetera. So, I would characterize it like this; there a number of interested parties out there who are in discussion. Interesting from a tax standpoint though as people or owners, I should say, are now considering what happens from a capital gains tax treatment or what happens from that standpoint. So, I would probably say, just a couple ago, with the looming concern that perhaps capital gains tax rate would go up from its sort of 22%-23% to 43% or so may have actually act as an accelerant to get some conversation started. And now some are looking at the latest sort of rumblings from the administration that perhaps, if there's a capital gains tax increase that would be backdated or begin in April, this current calendar year. So maybe that acts as a bit of a suppressant. But in the end, it time will tell, we're less worried about the pace or the rush in pursuing these and more in the relationships that we're building with these potential bolt-ons. But I think thus far it's pretty good when we've done two in the year and we did four or five in Q4. So, that should give you an indication in terms of pace. In terms of multiples, no change, we covered the multiples that we've been paying. And the deals that we've done in Q4 and Q1 are no different than that. And finally, you mentioned specialty in terms of any standouts. How can I resist sharing that, if you look at the -- out of the gates 20% growth in specialty just in the month of May, on top of that 18% or better than that 18% we saw in Q4, and frankly, it's really shared nicely. Our power and HVAC businesses in the 20% range, our flooring business is nearing 50% growth year-on-year. Climate Control is strong double-digits. So, there are no real standouts other than standouts among standouts, I suppose. Annelies Vermeulen That's okay. Thank you very much. Brendan Horgan Thank you. Operator And our next question is from Will Kirkness at Jefferies. Will your line is open. Please go ahead. Will Kirkness Thanks very much. Two or three here, but it's okay. Thanks for the comment on specialty growth in May, I wondered if you could just give U.S. rental revenue growth overall for May that'll be useful. Secondly, also thanks for the comments around wage rates. I just wondered if you could talk about what new joiner inflation is running out in percentage terms or perhaps per the percentage around that $25 per hour that you referenced. And then lastly, if one of you could help on utilization, I know you don't disclose it explicitly anymore, but just on the charts are obviously up in terms of fleet on rent versus '20 and '19. I think your AC is modestly down in the U.S. year-over-year, but still up very strongly versus '19. And just one of you can help us with utilization sounds like it's up to sort of pretty, pretty decent levels? Thanks very much. Brendan Horgan Yes, thanks. Good morning, Will. From a May growth in U.S., it's 17%, 18%, 17.5%. In terms of wage up, this inflation from a wage and wage pressure standpoint, I mentioned the $25 that works out to be about 6% increase for our non-union skilled trade, there's about 7,000 of them in North America alone. And that brings our average for our skilled trade workforce, just under $0.25 an hour. I frankly, I think it's something that will continue to move in that direction, and maybe even move faster than some might think, which again, I don't think is a bad thing. I think it's something that you have to be proactive in, in order to make sure you have the absolute best that are out in the marketplace, which we're confident that these steps continue to put us in a good position. I think you worked out the utilization pretty well on your own. If I just maybe add a bit of color around that, if we look at the month of April, and the month of May, in each seven out of 12 of our regions in the U.S., and eight out of 12 of the regions in the U.S., in either of the two months, had their best ever time utilization in the month of April or in the month of May. So I think that's a pretty positive sign. And again, it comes down to really now making sure that we have availability for our customers, because we don't want utilization to tip too high. We like to be able to say yes, because after all available is one part of that availability, reliability and ease. So as I said, we're going to temper our disposals until we get a better feel as to what demand looks like, but yes, we'll, as I've said, these are good conditions, utilization strong, momentum is there in terms of rate. And from a specialty standpoint, rates not part of the equation that really truly comes down to availability, reliability and ease. Hope that answers your questions. Will Kirkness Yes, that was perfect. Thanks very much. Brendan Horgan Great. Thanks, Will. Operator Our next question is from Neil Tyler at RedBurn. Neil your line is open. Please go ahead. Neil Tyler Good morning. Thank you. Two questions, firstly, on CapEx and I suppose, Brendan, following on from your comments, just then about tempering disposals, given the meticulous plan that you put together for the CapEx for the April 2022 year. I wonder you having to bring those planning procedures forward for the following period in, given the bottlenecks that exists in order to have access to more fleet? So I suppose that's the first question. You're accelerating the CapEx planning process over the medium-term? And the second question is on rate, it feels just running some numbers in my head. As you talk about that the cost inflation, that sort of four to 4% 5% rate increase, you'll probably be required across the group in order to maintain margin. Is that a sensible way to think about things? Brendan Horgan Those are the two of them, Neil? Neil Tyler Those are the two. Yes. Brendan Horgan Great. Well, first of all, I'd say, let me answer your second first, a 4% to 5%, on average, would more than adequately handle the inflation that we see today, you know, things could change. But I think that that would more than absorb that, if we're in the maybe 2% on average for the year, or a bit more than that, that's probably in a sort of maintenance margin range, but you bring up cost inflation. And I think it's important to look at this in two categories. One, let's look at our fleet rental assets. And we can look at that both in terms of replacement and growth. But if we just -- if we look at fleet, and given the way that I mentioned through or covered in the results presentation there, this exhaustive review that we that we go through. If we look at the assets that are fleet planned for, and therefore, secured build slots with our OEMs. They're all on order and various stages of purchase order as we speak. The assets we're replacing on average, we're going to dispose of today. Actually, we were just looking at this the other day, the average age of those assets, this minute that we've yet to dispose of is seven years, 10 months. So, by the time we dispose of them, let's just call it kind of eight years, those assets that we have or will replace in this fiscal year, their lifecycle inflation average is 3.25% in North America. So in the U.S., it's about 3% and 3.25%. In Canada its minus 2%, like that's important to understand, because what it shows is, from that eight year ago time, how much sort of buying power we have accumulated, how much more we spend in general, and look at Canada. Obviously, we weren't in Canada eight years ago, but we have some legacy assets from acquisitions that we are buying today less than the business would have bought eight years ago. So, that's what's happening now, that is not a statement in terms of what happens to fleet inflation in the coming year. I think that that is why no that that is yet to be told, we are doing our part to make sure that we can minimize as best as possible. But in the end, there will be some inflation out there. In terms of our planning or future planning, as you suggested, best way to answer that is this. Our fleet team is actively engaged with all of our primary OEMs as we speak, not just planning for FY23, but actually planning into FY24. So as part of Sunbelt 3.0, we are working with our partner OEMs to actually a telegraph, if you will, our replacement needs all the way through calendar 2024. So we're talking about what our supply and pipeline might look like. Beyond Sunbelt 3.0, we're not firm and fixing purchase orders. So don't worry about that. But that's the level of engagement as required. If you talk to any world class OEM, they will tell you that if they have a customer who helps them manage their longer, and if you will, their supply chain, it's what they value most. And working together that way is what helps curb inflation, although there will be inflation. But remember, it will only be for one year if you will were overall fleet dependent on how that how long that lasts. I hope that answers your questions, Neil. Neil Tyler That's suits and helpful. Thank you. Brendan Horgan Great, thank you. Operator For our next question, we'll turn to Andrew Wilson at JPMorgan. Andrew your line is open. Please go ahead. Andrew Wilson Hi, good day. Good morning, everyone. I just have one left actually a lot of areas wanted to discuss have been covered. It's kind of a question around, I guess, it's really on the M&amp;A side. I'm interested in the potential sentiment amongst the vendors of some of the better assets that you might have not been able to buy previously that might be interested in. And it's really thinking about this sort of -- you look at assets performance through the downturn where you've clearly been able to continue to invest in that, I presume hasn't been true of lots of the businesses in the same market. Then you come out of into a recovery phase and basically it's extremely hard to get equipment and it's getting increasingly expensive to do so. How that sort of driven the shift in terms of some of these vendors basically convincing them that selling might be a better idea than trying to continue to fight this out. It just seems to me that the last 12 months we'll probably given people a pretty stark, I guess, explanation of what this market is going to look like in almost that we'll be a bit more inclined to sort of join with us there rather than, than try and compete against them, just interested in terms of that sentiment. Brendan Horgan Sure. Andrew, if you're ever looking for anything else to do, come on board, I don't know. Look, you've framed it all really well. There's not much color I can add. Look the discussions we have, there's no question. If you not planned really well, you're not getting much equipment this year, plan simple. Furthermore, I bring back that ESG piece. There will be over time. I mentioned what we did with the G7 in the U.K. I was on a data center site three weeks ago. I'll leave the town out of the commentary and what I was there. I was meeting with the owners head of sustainability. I was meeting with the general contractors head of sustainability, and we were there to deliver the world's first ever fully battery powered non-hydraulic driven skid-steer loader, if that means anything to you. So my point is, that sort of investment is significant, and there will be barriers to enter so to speak. And you have to have the level of sophistication in the team that actually understands what we're trying to do, because OEMs need us to partner with them as well, because we have the sort of a playground if you will or sandbox in order to test these sort of products. And it's those sorts of things that independent owners of varying sizes are beginning to get their minds around and saying, am I really ready for that journey, it's a very different one, but again, I think you've really on your own and the question, almost answered it and highlighted it really well. Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Wilson Thank, Brendan. Appreciate it. I'll keep the job offer in mind. Thanks. Brendan Horgan You got it. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Arnaud Lehman at Bank of America. Arnaud, your line is open. Please go ahead. Arnaud Lehman Thank you very much. Good morning gentleman. Firstly just on your CapEx guidance that I believe you increased a little bit this morning. And that's, I guess related to comments around some insulation, even decent increase in volumes are increasing value, I guess is my question. Do you have to spend a bit more to get the same amount of equipment coming to your warehouses or to the building sites? Secondly, would you mind giving a bit of color on what to expect in terms of drops through for just called 2022, obviously once a race are improving and volumes are good, because there is also customization, maybe some six cars coming back, maybe traveling around a bit more. So any color on that would be appreciated. So you're moving your current of reporting to dollar. I think that makes sense. You need to first step, are you thinking of let's say U.S. dual listing or anything like that, or I did for now, unless we on U.K. equipment sales, I think there this equal 2021, they're like two to three times the size of 2020 comes off as short sales. What would be the normal run rates of going forward, please? Thank you. Brendan Horgan Let me tackle your third question, then I take the rest are primed for Michael. In terms of currency reporting as we've announced this morning, and I think Michael covered well, look it says it is clear as can be. It is simply a transparency. It is simply the vast majority of our revenues and profits are in U.S. dollars, and finally for me to be able to keep up with all these numbers, it's a whole hell of a lot easier. If I can just speak in dollars instead of going back between dollars and pounds, there's nothing else to be read into that. We will be reporting from Q1 in U.S. dollars. So, I'll hand the rest over to Michael. Michael Pratt Good morning. Yes, so I'll piggyback up on the CapEx point is more refinement point, as we went through the budgeting process, you've heard Brendan talk about the level of life cycle inflation we're getting. So there's no, if you think about when we do our planning, and when we agree where we are for the current year, there's not a significant impact there. So, it's more that we just picked up the amount. I think we know we raised the lower end of the range and the upper end of the range by about $100 million in the U.S. So there's nothing more than that of them sort of a refinement of the process. In terms of drop through, you're right there, the year we just had a lot of moving parts. And as a consequence, they had a knock-on effect, as we go forward. As we alluded to, at the Capital Markets Day, or told that Capital Markets Day, we'd expect drop through to improve as we go through the three year period. But in the coming year, we expected probably to be in the low-40s. When we've talked about the bad debt reserve relief that we had this last year, if you think about, we'll have over time coming back into the business, you've got T&amp;E coming back into the business, et cetera. And you're right to then also to touch on inflation. So, there's lot of moving parts, but they are sort of headwinds, which once you get onto a normalized basis, if you were to and I'm not suggesting I do it just for, if you try and normalize, you get back to sort of somewhere in the 50s that we normally talk about, but there are some headwinds this time around. In terms of U.K. equipment, I think what you're looking at is you're referring to the U.K. equipment sales, but you're just talking about the difference between, I guess rental revenue, and the total revenue in the U.K. as we talk about, that's not all used equipment sales at all, a quite a bit of that is ancillaries and sales for support of the NHS, so where we are supporting the rental, the various products that we're having to buy in and then sell on. So, the way things are done normally, almost go back to prior years, going forward there should be no real change in the balance between rental and total revenue is just with the work that we're doing for the Department of Health, et cetera then there is a slight divergence this year, and also for the year coming as well. Arnaud Lehman All very clear, thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Before I take the next question, which is from Karl Green at the Royal Bank of Canada [Operator Instructions] Karl, I'll now open your line. Please go ahead. Karl Green Yes, thank you very much. Good morning. Just a couple of final questions for me just firstly, in terms of managing the labor force and thinking about minimizing the need to hire in new talent, what sort of labor capacity slack do you have at the moment? So I'm thinking now in terms of being able to offer people incremental over time, so their total base pack goes up, they feel happier, your retention continues to improve and then the second question, unrelated just around depreciation. Given that tightness of supply, are you likely to see any assets over the coming 12 to 18 months, which are going to be rented out but fully depreciated? Or is that too much of a risk in terms of reliability from your perspective? Thank you. Brendan Horgan Great, thanks, Karl. I'll take the second one first, in terms of there's no risk there in terms of that aging, if you will. And certainly it wouldn't be in most cases fully depreciated. Some would hold, some sort of residual. I think Michael may answer to that. Michael Pratt All I can say is we've talked about a lot in the year just gone. We have a pretty well trodden path as to when we look to dispose of assets. And so we are, we will continue that with the fact that we told you that a few months if we delay disposals in the early part of the year, just to deal with the high levels of demand as we go through the summer season. But now we'll look to be adhering to our fleet plan, because it's all geared to what is the optimal time to keep an asset and to get the best returns from it. Brendan Horgan Great, and to your question on sort of managing this labor force as we refer to a skilled trade, there's two pieces one in our existing businesses and if we look at our time utilization that I mentioned, we do have some capacity, our over time levels are not quite back up to what they were at peak, which means that we're seeing some efficiency improvement, given the relative fleet size that you would have heard Will Kirkness point out. So, there's a bit of latent capacity so to speak there. The other part of course is our Greenfield program. So when you're opening two Greenfields a week, there is a significant recruiting campaign that goes on. And our recruiting department is certainly heavily involved in those markets. The good thing is of course, you would have heard from Brad Lull during the CMD, how telegraphed our Greenfield program is so we know in what geographies we will be adding Greenfields, in February or next June. So that gives our recruiters the opportunity to do it that way. But sort of the brand, from an employment standpoint, when we talk about the things that we have, not only what we did in terms of no redundancies, et cetera in the year, the bonuses, the safety environment, the training, all those things go into it significantly. And that's what today's workforce is looking for. And we have a lot of emphasis and investment going into that. Karl Green That's really helpful. Thanks very much. And just following on from that, have you got any retention statistics, you can share in terms of how that's tracking at the moment versus say 2019, I guess 2020 is probably quite irrelevant? Brendan Horgan Yes, you'll see them on the Annual Council, when we talk about skilled trade in particular will be in the low to mid-teens from a voluntary turnover standpoint, which I think in the current environment is not a bad place to be, understand our business, driving one of our trucks of 50,000 GVW vehicle, and a driver who is trained and operates 2,200 skews of serialized assets on and off. It's not for the faint heart. And we tend to know pretty soon, there's sort of a magic milestone of 12, 18 months that once we have one of our skilled trade team members who stay at that point, from that point on, we kind of can't even get rid of them. They like it, it gets in their DNA. So that's kind of how I would put context to that. Karl Green Understood, thanks very much. Brendan Horgan Great, thanks Karl. Operator Thank you. For our final question, we'll turn to Rahul Chopra at HSBC. Rahul, your line is open. Please go ahead. Rahul Chopra Hello, thank you so much. I've couple of questions in terms -- one is in terms of provisions, I think you earlier said that you had good collections towards the end of this year. So can you just remind in terms of what's probably in terms of provision, how much contribution and if there could be potential to even looking forward in terms of FY '22 first quarter or second-half, first-half, that's the first. Secondly, in terms of the CapEx raising of Â£5.5 million, can you just give us shape in terms of how should we think in terms of the facing for the next couple of years? And in terms of can you just remind us in terms of PSGA adoption rates and is there any potential upside to CapEx from the ESG transformation or is it already baked into those CapEx numbers? Thank you. Brendan Horgan Michael, do you want to handle provisions? Michael Pratt Yes, let me tell you that the receivables one, I think we what we said is cash collections were strong throughout the year. And I suppose the way to sort of characterize it in terms of where we ended up at April, and this is probably the best way to sort of characterize in the U.S. We ended up with a position at the end of April, whereby despite revenues being higher than they were in Q4 of last year, we ended up with receivables lower than they were at the end of Q4 last year. So, if you go April this year to April last year, we ended up with lower receivables and better aging, which is what contributed to it, we said well, you don't need the level of provision that you had before. So that dynamic will impact on how we came up with where we were from a provisioning perspective at year-end. Brendan Horgan In terms of I think I understood your question, in terms of CapEx phasing in sort of future years, I think for actually that question and your ESG sort of angle on that. It's important to understand that Slide 32 which we have in the appendix of the result this morning. And it really comes down to this sort of fleet profile we have. So, to answer your first question, you can see quite clearly, we've made a step change in terms of replacement in the current fiscal year, which is part of these figures, and there's a modest increase in over the next couple of years, but you'll really see there's quite a bit of consistency until we get to the point of replacing the assets we would have acquired in 2019 which is that next step change. So you're not even talking about, you're talking about 2027 kind of range at that point in time. And when it comes to your question, if I understood the sort of lens in which you were asking it through, correctly what happened. So, I mentioned the battery powered skid steer loader. So, what happens, if the battery powered skid steer loader becomes mainstream, it does not mean that the diesel powered skid loader crates early grave for itself. Instead, what you'll find is it comes back again to that fleet aging profile. From a manufacturing standpoint, and a sort of financing, if you will, in the broader equipment space, manufacturers can only manufacturer enough in a year to replace the assets need replacing, and satisfy the growth or maybe in a year. So when they do that, it goes into those bands. So next year, we'll replace then eight year old assets. And if there is some significant innovation, which there will be innovation, but it's not going to be overnight, it's going to be over time, then you would address that year, you would address the three year old assets. And that's kind of the way that your best sort of seeing that go down the road. This is probably a good question to add some color to the statement I made during the results. And that is beginning in Q1 we'll pick up one of our specific strategic actionable components in Sunbelt 3.0 and add a bit more color. So, certainly one of those, I'm not saying exactly when will be ESG, that would be very focused on not just the 35 by 30, but actually giving tangible anecdotes as to what's happening in the marketplace and how we're addressing that. So I think that's probably a good area to speak in more detail to the question that you've asked, is that all clear, Rahul? Rahul Chopra Yes, I think that's helpful. Thanks a lot, really helpful. Operator Thank you. So, that concludes questions on today's call. I would now like to pass back to Brendan for any closing comments. Brendan Horgan Great, thank you all for your participation this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you following our Q1. Take care. Operator Thanks everybody. You may now disconnect your lines.",2021-06-15

Network and learn with industry peers. Learn More   Elisity, a cybersecurity startup, today announced that it raised $26 million in a funding round led by Two Bear Capital and AllegisCyber Capital. CEO James Winebrenner says that the capital will be put toward scaling Elisity’s operations as it accelerates R&D and customer acquisition. According to a recent study published by the University of Maryland, hackers attack every 39 seconds, or about 2,244 times a day. The average time to identify a breach in 2019 was 206 days, at which point the cost could be in excess of $3.92 million. Kaspersky Lab reported a threefold year-over-year increase in smart gadget hacks in the first half of 2018, with one malware variant managing to infect 57,000 wireless security cameras. Elisity, whose founding team includes Cisco, Qualys, and Viptela veterans, offers a product suite that’s designed to secure data while ensuring access. It combines the paradigm of zero trust access, meaning no user is trusted by default from inside or outside the network, and a software-defined perimeter to authorize users, devices, and apps based on policies before they can communicate with critical resources. Access is monitored by AI algorithms that track, monitor, and analyze flows and user behavior to make recommendations and discover all of an organization’s assets to build an encrypted mesh overlay between a cloud services panel and network probes. Elisity was started in 2018 by Burjiz Pithawala, Sundher Narayan, and Srinivas Sardar, all of whom previously held leadership roles in product development and architecture at Cisco. The executive team is headed by Winebrenner, who led the go-to-market strategy for Viptela from pre-launch through to the sale to Cisco in 2017.

The approach abstracts and centralizes the access mechanisms, so that the security engineers and staff can be responsible for them. The global zero trust security market is expected to reach $54.6 billion by 2026, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 18.8%. Gartner posits that this reflects the technology’s potential: More resilient environments with improved flexibility and better monitoring appeal to organizations looking for more flexible — and responsive — ways to connect and collaborate with their digital business ecosystems, remote workers, and partners. With Elisity, devices can connect to a software-defined, app-centric virtual network that runs atop existing transport networks only if they’re configured with a policy. The mesh decouples app access from underlying network access, assuming the network is untrustworthy. Similar to a traditional virtual private network (VPN), services brought within the Elisity environment aren’t visible on the internet and are thus mostly shielded from attackers. Organizations can connect and secure access in campus, branch, and remote offices to apps in the cloud, multicloud, and datacenter environments. “Elisity’s AI-powered … platform fuses identity and behavioral intelligence to continuously assess risk and instantly optimize access, connectivity, and protection policies that follow … devices, applications and people wherever they go,” Winebrenner told VentureBeat via email. “By integrating asset management, connectivity, and security, Elisity helps enterprise-class organizations across industries including financial services, health care, and manufacturing break through today’s siloed enterprise networking-and-security group challenges.”  Winebrenner says the mesh isn’t just a VPN replacement, but rather a platform that helps companies transition to zero trust across their digital footprint. Elisity provides real-time information on who’s accessing resources and from where, allowing admins to segment environments based on traffic flow and machine identity. It also lets them manage a unified access policy and support the requirements of remote access in a secure way, migrating workloads across clouds or within a VPN in a cloud. Winebrenner claims that 31-employee Elisity allows enterprises in industries such as manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, financial services, and health care to realize cost savings, time savings, and risk mitigation because they no longer have to rely on disparate software to protect access. He says the platform reduces the total number of tools required to manage access — without taking such access for granted. “Distributed enterprises need agile security for their remote workforce. But converged cloud security approaches don’t take into consideration the unmanaged or managed devices employees are using, often without any visibility from IT or security. The industry most go beyond edge security, it must go beyond … identity and access management,” Winebrenner added. “The better approach is the integration of all these things into security that gets closest to the asset or user and understands the context of behavioral changes.” Milpitas, California-based Elisity’s latest funding round, a series A, brings the company’s total raised to over $33 million to date.

Bitwise, now four years old, became profitable this year when it crossed $1.2 billion in assets under management at the end of the first quarter. Part of the motivation behind this fundraising was to bring big stakeholders in the young company's journey, CEO Hunter Horsley told CNBC.""We wanted to get some of the best minds, investors and backers across Wall Street and crypto involved with the company because we see an opportunity to build an enduring institution,"" Horsley said.Other new investors include D1 Chief Investment Officer Daniel Sundheim, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, Dan Loeb's Third Point LLC, Daniel Och's Willoughby Capital, Louis Bacon's Moore Strategic Ventures and Paul Eisenstein's Vetamer Capital; as well as a number of current and former banking, asset management and tech executives. Existing investors Elad Gil and Electric Capital led the round. Other existing backers like Highland Capital, Khosla Ventures, Castle Island Ventures and Naval Ravikant participated, too.Bitwise plans to use the funds to strengthen its balance sheet and develop its research, client service and sales teams. It has doubled the size of those teams from the start of 2021 and plans to double them again by year-end. The company also plans to launch more products this year, Horsley said, though he declined to give more detail on the matter. Bitwise currently offers several cryptocurrency index funds, ""but there's more that we want to do,"" Horsley added.Bitwise is focused on serving long-term investors that want exposure to cryptocurrencies, rather than traders, by enabling financial advisors to steward it for them. Its approach is to create funds that are compatible with existing infrastructure and workflows that individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans, financial advisors and taxable brokerage accounts use.""Much of the crypto industry is trading and traders, people looking at the price everyday and thinking about what the latest news or tweet means for price over the next seven days,"" Horsley said. ""We serve the long- term investor thinking if this has a role to play in the next 5-10 years of how they approach their portfolio and building a thesis.""""It's an audience that has slightly different behaviors,"" he added. ""We've seen inflows every day for the last two months despite market pullback, and it's a really important additional audience to come into the space.""One of Bitwise's more popular funds tracks an index of the 10 largest crypto assets, including bitcoin, ether and litecoin. The company also launched this year a decentralized finance index fund and a crypto ETF. The ETF holds 30 stocks whose companies derive 75% of their income from cryptocurrency or have 75% of net assets in crypto.In January, 81% of 1,000 financial advisors Bitwise surveys annually said they were fielding questions from clients about cryptocurrencies. Of those advisors, 17% said they were considering making their first crypto allocation on behalf of clients this year.Bitwise was one of the first companies to apply for a bitcoin ETF in early 2019. It withdrew that application in January 2020 and has yet to refile it. Several companies have entered or re-entered the bitcoin ETF race this year, including Fidelity, NYDIG, VanEck and SkyBridge Capital.""The SEC is very thoughtful on the space, is considering the right dimensions in terms of evaluating perspective and we're trying to be helpful collaborator to them,"" Horsley said. ""We're spending time there, we're optimistic one will be possible and we'll file when we think the time is right.""",2021-06-15

Nevertheless, entering the Asia-Pacific and European trading hours on June 15, the pair corrected by more than 4.5%, hitting an intraday low of $24.25.Polkadot pulls back after testing technical resistance near $26.668. Source: TradingViewInitial upside moves in the DOT market surfaced in the wake of the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally on June 13. Billionaire investor Elon Musk commented that day that he would reinstate accepting Bitcoin payments for Tesla’s electric vehicles if the cryptocurrency's new supply is mined using renewable energy.The BTC/USD exchange rate jumped from as low as $34,780 to above $40,000 after Musk's comments. Meanwhile, top altcoins — which heavily tail Bitcoin trends — followed suit, taking DOT prices higher as well.Nevertheless, the scale at which Polkadot's coin rose dwarfed the retracement rallies of most of its top crypto rivals. DOT's heightened move uphill coincided with Coinbase Pro's announcement that it was adding DOT-enabled trading instruments to its platform.Starting today, inbound transfers for DOT are now available in the regions where trading is supported. Traders cannot place orders and no orders will be filled. Trading will begin on or after 9AM PT on Wednesday June 16, if liquidity conditions are met.  https://t.co/iWgfMf9B4x— Coinbase Pro (@CoinbasePro) June 14, 2021  Kusama parachain auctionMore bullish cues for traders came from startup Parallel Finance. The firm raised $2 million to bring its lending and staking features to the Polkadot and Kusama networks. Kusama works as a sandbox for projects with aspirations to launch a parachain on Polkadot. Therefore, the testbed blockchain comes with real economic benefits and consequences, enabling other blockchains and apps to launch with forkless upgrades, governance structure and scalability.That said, projects harness Kusama's interparachain network to communicate with other apps having their separate parachains.But to win a parachain slot, projects such as Parallel Finance must participate in a parachain auction. In doing so, they need to submit the bid amount (in DOT or KSM) alongside the slot duration (6 to 24 months). That effectively locks away DOT and KSM tokens for the duration of the slot, thereby reducing the tokens' circulating supply.Meanwhile, observers believe that DOT's and KSM's demand will keep rising based on the competitive auction process. #Polkadot is seeing one of its breakout days in quite some time, jumping +20% as #Bitcoin crossed back above $40k for the first time since May 26th. A promising sign that $DOT can fully recover is its continued rising #Github development activity. ‍ https://t.co/nf3Sdj07Wj pic.twitter.com/1SpCSzs5JZ— Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 14, 2021  Projects that win a parachain auction will do a lot to provide value to their community and backers, according to Alex Siman, founder of Subsocial — a Polkadot-based decentralized social network.""On the Polkadot parachain, the slots for projects to build on the chain is limited to 100, making the auction process notably competitive,"" he explained. ""A non-innovative project may not be able to win such auctions, and those who do will not want to waste the opportunity to go down in history.""Related: Kraken launches Kusama parachain auction platform as KSM defies downtrendThe first parachain auction went live on the Kusama network around 11:00 UTC on June 15.

Mira Christanto, a researcher at crypto data analytics firm Messari, noted that 65% of DOT's active supply has already been staked since May. Only 30% of DOT now remains in circulation, and the upcoming parachain auctions will take more of those tokens out of supply.""After the parachain launch, 40% of DOT could be bonded in parachains, hence reducing effective circulating supply to only 15%,"" she added.

The incredible momentum in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) that took the price from the $10,000s to over $60,000 has reversed, with Bitcoin giving back around half of the rally. For reference, Bitcoin traded in the $10,000s during last summer and fall before skyrocketing. Some factors that drove up the price back then include increased retail and institutional adoption of Bitcoin and retail investors speculating. Adoption continues to increase but is being counterbalanced by the uncertainty that has caused Bitcoin to fall in price. As of my writing this, Bitcoin seems to be on its way back up, but here are some reasons that the rally in Bitcoin faded after hitting its all-time high:  The Chinese Communist Party launched a fresh crackdown on Bitcoin, arresting over 1,100 people. Like many things in China, there are two sides to the story here, with the government claiming the groups were involved in criminal activity and some in the crypto community claiming that the main point of the crackdown was to seize private wealth. China's crackdown contrasts with greater acceptance of Bitcoin in Latin America, with El Salvador making Bitcoin a legal tender for the country alongside the U.S. dollar.  There has been a lot of discussion lately on whether Bitcoin is bad for the environment. Investing in cryptocurrencies and ESG investing are both desirable for institutions, and until recently, most people were not aware of the conflict between the two. Bitcoin uses a ton of electricity, until now much of it came from coal-powered plants in China. China is cracking down on individuals mining Bitcoinâthe speculation is that maybe they'll use excess capacity from their massive hydroelectric dams to centralize Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin in its current form uses a lot of energy, but remember like the internet in the 1990s, Bitcoin is a work-in-progress. Ethereum (ETH-USD) has announced that they will be moving from a ""proof of work"" model to a ""proof of stake"" model, which is much more energy-efficient. The Bitcoin developer community similarly is likely to improve Bitcoin which could take the energy usage from a massive level to a negligible one. See the Lightning Network for one example of a possible improvement. Gold mining uses a lot of energy as well, as do S&amp;P 500 stocks like Tesla (TSLA), but commentators are fixated on Bitcoin at the moment. The ESG arguments against investing seem somewhat two-dimensional to me, while the three-dimensional picture is much more complex. Elon Musk tweeted negatively about Bitcoin recently. This catalyst has flipped again as Musk is helping Bitcoin go higher. Musk obviously has millions of followers on Twitterâhe can write haiku and post memes and have 25 different mainstream media outlets analyzing his opinion. Elon has recently tweeted about Bitcoin, Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), or C*mrocket (his new favorite cryptocurrency). Musk also said he would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment for Tesla. On a similar note, a TikToker stripped on stage at the Bitcoin conference in Miami last week and shouted ""Dogecoin to the moon"" before security carried him out. Depending on what side of the bed he wakes up on next, Musk could either help or hurt the price of Bitcoin going forward. Margin calls. I can't believe people actually do this, but there are some people out there who like to amp up the volatility of Bitcoin even more, so they borrow against their Bitcoin to buy even more. The obvious problem is that the collateral for the loan is Bitcoin, which is the most volatile asset around. When the price falls, the lenders call the loans and sell, which drives the price even lower, which forces other liquidations. This forced selling causes price crashes, and the speculators generally lose all their money.  These factors help explain Bitcoin's rise and fall from its peak in April. Data by YCharts Is Bitcoin A Good Investment? Throughout the history of civilization, power, financial resources, and information were held in the hands of only a few people. Obviously, this is still true to some extent, but relatively recently the internet came along and turned the world upside down as young people with good ideas found the perfect medium for distributing them all over the world, sometimes making more money in a few short years than their parents and role models made in their entire lives. Maybe someone bullied you in high school. Maybe your significant other cheated on you in college. Maybe you've dreamed about becoming a multi-millionaire and thumbing your nose at people in your past. If your prospects in pro sports or entertainment are dim, working and investing in technology is your best shot at making it happen. When these things happened to our parents and grandparents, most of them found themselves working 8 to 5 jobs for peanuts with no easy way out. Maybe they took a chance on a dream by moving to New York or Los Angeles, but most people never get that kind of chance. Today, thanks to the internet, it seems there's never been an easier time to become a multimillionaire, and it doesn't even matter where you live. The internet gives you limitless scale to achieve this sort of non-linear success. While the negatives of technology make for good stories in the mainstream media, the birth of the internet has democratized power, money, and information more than any other invention in history. This extends to BTC. In its simplest form, Bitcoin is an extension of the decentralized power of the internet, applied to money. A recent study showed that nearly 1/3rd of millennials with $1 million or more in investible assets have 1/2 or more of their wealth in Bitcoin. If the sample survey is to be believed, crypto has created a significant portion of the millennial millionaires, and tech at large has created a strong majority of them. The oldest millennials are turning 40 this year, and there are about 600,000 millionaires for 72 million people in the millennial generation (a little less than 1 percent of the total generation). The money being made in tech and crypto is real and comes from adding value to the world. Bitcoin adoption has rapidly increased in countries like Venezuela, where it has helped Venezuelans abroad get money to their families in need without dealing with the political will of either the U.S. government or the Venezuelan government. El Salvador similarly is adopting Bitcoin as legal tender and plans on mining the coin with volcanic steam, which could help reduce poverty. Americans who are worried about the fiscal obligations and monetary system at home similarly have adopted cryptocurrency. Bitcoin gets its value from adoptionâthe more people that adopt Bitcoin, the more valuable it is. Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a network grows exponentially as adoption increases. That's how the BTC went from ~$600 to ~$60,000 in 5 years. Since BTC is growing so fast, this invites speculation as to what the final value of Bitcoin will be when the project is fully mature 5-10 years down the road. One way of thinking about Bitcoin volatility is that small changes in future adoption make for big changes in value. Another way to think about it is that the valuation can change a lot with efforts of major governments to regulate, tax, or ban Bitcoin since the valuation likely assumes a certain level of future growth in the asset. In the long run, I think that crypto will see increased adoption that will give it a market cap that is significantly higher than today. Along the way, volatility is a given for the same reason that Bitcoin is a good investment because small changes in adoption lead to big changes in value. If you don't believe that Bitcoin will be banned by Western governments (I don't), then Bitcoin is still a good long-term investment in my view. People who have been around crypto a long time are used to the volatility, but people who are new to it can be somewhat shocked. Will Bitcoin Go Back Up or Will it Crash Again? I believe that crypto adoption will continue to increase in the coming years and that Bitcoin will rise in price. Bitcoin investors should be prepared for 50 percent drops at any point though, although the drop may come from a price significantly higher than the current price. Overall, the pullback in Bitcoin makes sense given what is going on with some of the uncertainty in the world, but that the risk of Bitcoin being banned or going to zero is low. I took some profits in Bitcoin for personal reasons in the $40,000s, but Bitcoin remains one of my largest holdings. There is some risk that Bitcoin is not the crypto of the future, but the network effects seem to me that either Bitcoin, Ethereum, or both remain the key cryptos and can change their coding to innovate. I'll share a brief story for my readers so that they can learn from it and not make the same mistakes that I almost made, which I feel is the single biggest risk in crypto. I recently got a new phone, and of course, traded my old phone in for 100 bucks or whatever they gave me. What I didn't realize is that my 2-factor authentication was tied to the old phone, so when I went to log into my BlockFi account after having a couple of glasses of wine, I couldn't get into my account. I tried the Google Authenticator with the new phone and my Google account, but Google gave me an error message when I did that. I had to use the recovery key that they gave me when I set up my account. I'm in. No big deal, right? Before it logs me in, something pops up with another recovery key, which I can't really tell if it's the same or not. I take a picture of it to be safe. The next time I log into my account, I realize that the old recovery key did not work and that me taking a picture may have been the only thing that saved me from losing all of my crypto. I withdrew all of my crypto from BlockFi after this and put it in the exchange-traded Grayscale Trust (OTC:GBTC) at a discount to NAV to avoid becoming a statistic. I don't know for sure whether I would have been able to get my crypto back or not. I've had friends lose hundreds of thousands of dollars of crypto by losing their keys to it. There's a guy in the UK who accidentally threw out over $250 million in Bitcoin. The New York Times profiled a programmer in San Francisco who lost over $200 million in Bitcoin as well. In the second case, the guy simply doesn't remember the password. There are two sides to this argument, the first that when other people lose the keys to their currency that it benefits everyone else, and the second is that if it could happen to you it's a ridiculous risk. In the end, maybe the biggest risk of investing in Bitcoin isn't that the price crashes, but that something happens to you or you forget your password and lose all your money into cyberspace. If anyone here has lost Bitcoin and is willing to share, please share your story in the comments, I believe my readers would benefit from your experience! Conclusion  For those who are comfortable stomaching volatility, I think that the upside continues to strongly outweigh the downside in Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been through some wild ups and downs before, and will likely do so in the future. I'm a strong believer in the long-term potential of cryptocurrency, and my money is behind it. Bitcoin's success has not and will not be linear, but if you're willing to go along for the ride, good things have happened and should continue to happen going forward. Bitcoin has likely created more millennial millionaires than any other invention in history, and it's important to see the forest through the trees if you're looking to build meaningful amounts of wealth for the long term.",2021-06-15

With this sale, Anatha's objective is to make the purchase of cryptocurrency accessible to more people around the world.   Continue Reading                 Anatha: Crypto for the 100%                   The ANATHA public token sale is among the first to accept debit/credit cards for as little as $50 to start. Through its partner, Simplex, people can use their credit/debit cards to buy up to $25,000 of ANATHA, the highest limit ever. Buyers can of course use either ethereum (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC), as well.  Anatha is dedicated to helping eliminate global poverty by creating an ecosystem and economic model that returns the value generated on the network directly back to participants. Rather than the company extracting the value that people create using the application, that value automatically flows directly to the very people who created it through its hard-coded mechanism, the Anatha Torus. This includes 25% of the inflation model as newly minted tokens are continuously distributed directly to end users. The goal is to create a regenerative, bottom-up universal basic income (UBI) that can elevate all participants above the global poverty line. ""Cryptocurrency is not just an asset; it is a radical technology that can and will fundamentally change the world—and, in fact, already is,"" Edward DeLeon, founder and CEO of Anatha. ""After all, money and economic systems are the protocol layer of any society allowing for the distribution and expression of value, division and diversification of labor, as well as the management of wealth. We are aiming high, leveraging these technologies to eliminate global poverty.""This Anatha ecosystem features a new approach to sending and receiving tokens meant to make crypto more accessible—a human readable address system (aka an HRA). While many in the industry are offering name registries to make unwieldy crypto addresses easy to remember, Anatha has created a simple, accessible, and interoperable protocol. People can register their HRA which looks like a handle on any social media — @name, with no extensions. A one year HRA subscription costs one ANATHA which, at the time of launch, will be approximately $.35 (the price shifts as it is pegged to the price of the Euro).By registering an HRA, people automatically participate in the Anatha Torus, earning more ANATHA tokens daily. As of today—the mainnet went live on October 1, 2020 with the most successful ILO in decentralized exchange history—everyone in the Anatha Torus earns around $6.10 a day. That means, right now, everyone in the Anatha Network is living above the poverty line.Going forward, Anatha will add new modules and features—including a decentralized exchange (DEX) and social features—that will generate more value on the network as well as greater everyday utility.The Anatha public token sale is different from others in many ways. There is no limited window for crypto ""insiders."" Instead, the the sale is ongoing, designed to reach everyone, everywhere—which is why the initial total supply is over 7.8B: one ANATHA for everyone on the planet. And unlike the majority of sales, Anatha is selling 98% of the total token supply, keeping only 2% for bonuses, bounties, and future partners. This reinforces the company's belief in the power of decentralization and its dedication to creating a true Crypto for the 100%.For more information about Anatha, please visit anatha.io.

CoinFlip's new ad, titled ""So Flippin' Easy,"" features actor and long-time crypto investor Neil Patrick Harris unveiling the company's ATM and cash to Bitcoin model, allowing anyone to join the wave of mass crypto adoption. ""Cryptocurrency is the future of how we shop, invest, and do business, but it can also be incredibly technical and intimidating. I prefer my transactions to be simple and to the point,"" said Neil Patrick Harris. ""It's why I joined forces with CoinFlip – their ATMs make it so anyone can turn their cash into a significant investment opportunity with a great return. I'm pleased to partner with them and spread the word about how their ATMs and online Trade Desk services work so more people can have access to the exciting world of cryptocurrency."" With this campaign, CoinFlip leans further into its mission of making cryptocurrency more accessible by educating the public about the ease of participating using the cash they have on hand. As more consumers look for ways to incorporate crypto into their finances, CoinFlip provides a simple easy way to invest for those that aren't tech-savvy. Harris is a great spokesperson and prime example of someone who started out investing in cryptocurrency early as a novice and learned more over time. ""Cryptocurrency can be intimidating, and one of the things we set out to do with this campaign was to demystify it by showing how simple it can be to buy Bitcoin,"" said Ben Weiss, CEO of CoinFlip. ""As a company, CoinFlip is committed to helping everyone have access to the benefits of Bitcoin. Some people leverage crypto as an alternative asset; others use crypto when they have reduced or no access to traditional banking resources. No matter the reason, CoinFlip will be there with our expansive ATM network, online trading options and award-winning customer service to answer any questions you may have whether you are making your 1,000th transaction or your first."" Created by advertising agency The Boathouse, the campaign will debut nationally across television, OTT, YouTube and social channels. Television and OTT spots will initially run in five markets: Chicago, Boston, Tampa, Denver and San Antonio with :60, :30, :15 and :6 second spots.

In particular, the NFT that Berners-Lee will be selling consists of four parts according to Sotheby's: ""original time-stamped files containing the source code written by Sir Tim; an animated visualization of the code; a letter written by Sir Tim reflecting on the code and the process of creating it; as well as a digital 'poster' of the full code created by Sir Tim from the original files using Python including a graphic of his physical signature.""     A letter by Tim Berners-Lee reflecting on the WWW's source code. Credit: courtesy sotheby's   “Three decades ago, I created something which, with the subsequent help of a huge number of collaborators across the world, has been a powerful tool for humanity. (...) NFTs, be they artworks or a digital artefact like this, are the latest playful creations in this realm, and the most appropriate means of ownership that exists. They are the ideal way to package the origins behind the web,” Berners-Lee said in a statement. SEE ALSO:  This beginner-friendly guide will teach you all about NFTs    The sale, which opens on June 23, will start at $1,000, but given that high-profile NFTs are often sold for millions, Berners-Lee's WWW NFT could easily reach a much higher price. According to Sotheby's, the proceeds for the sale will benefit initiatives that Berners Lee and his wife, Lady Rosemary Leith Berners-Lee, support.Berners-Lee never patented his inventions of the world wide web and the first browser, releasing the source code for free instead. Together with his wife Rosemary Leith, Berners-Lee sits on the board of the World Wide Web Consortium, which they co-founded in 2009 to advance the open web as a public good and a basic right. Berners-Lee is also CTO of software company Inrupt. In 2019, Berners-Lee published an open letter, outlining some of the issues that ""plague"" today's web, including online crime, ad-based revenue models that reward the spread of misinformation, and bad design which harms the quality of online discourse. The launch of the NFT is his first public venture into cryptocurrencies, but according to the Financial Times, he sees similarities between his original vision for the web, and the decentralized nature of Ethereum, which is where most NFTs reside.

Tweet this           Black Tech Street NFT Coin         Mr. Billingsley and impact and innovation company SecondMuse introduced Black Tech Street at the centennial of the Greenwood Massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 30, 2021. Black Tech Street will build a tech hub of Black entrepreneurs in what was once the wealthiest and most successful Black community in the United States before it was destroyed by racism and hate a century ago.  ""Building on the launch of Black Tech Street this month, we're excited to launch the Centennial Coin in partnership with Blockchange. We want Tulsa to be ground zero for a movement and mindset shift that sees Black people everywhere embrace Tech as a means to build wealth and positively impact the world. This Coin is one avenue to kickstart that movement,"" said SecondMuse Co-CEO Todd Khozein. Blockchange is a social innovation fundraising platform that combines cryptocurrency, NFTs, and gamification, while leveraging tax policy, to create a self-sustaining charitable donation ecosystem.The Centennial Coin will honor one of the founders of Black Wall Street, O.W. Gurley, while also representing the future of Black industry and innovation. Donors can bid on the NFT in an auction that will open on Juneteenth (June 19, 2021). 100% of the proceeds from the auction will go to Black Tech Street to fund programming. What makes this fundraising approach unique is the power of smart contracts and the secondary market for NFTs. This evolves traditional charitable giving by making it possible for the initial donation to continue to pay dividends to the charity as well as future buyers. Each time the coin is sold on the secondary market, Black Tech Street will receive a royalty of 50% of the sale price and the buyer will get a commensurate tax advantage, creating an inclusive and self-sustaining economy for charitable giving where everyone wins. ""We call it regenerative fundraising for world-changing causes,"" said Ron Guirguis, co-founder of Blockchange. ""And we couldn't imagine better partners than Black Tech Street and SecondMuse who are working to create intergenerational wealth for Black entrepreneurs in Tulsa and beyond.""According to Mr. Billingsley, using the emerging technology of NFTs to both honor the past and build the future, is a perfect expression of the vision and ambition of Black Tech Street. ""We are using cutting edge technology and emerging financial vehicles to help fund on-the-ground programs designed to unlock the creativity, innovation and passion of Black tech entrepreneurs now and for years to come,"" Billingsley said.For more information on the Centennial Coin auction, visit www.bringblockchange.com.About Black Tech StreetBlack Tech Street aims to facilitate $1 billion of investment in the Black Tulsa Economy over 10 years by facilitating entrepreneur support programming that will create a tightly knit, collaborative community of Black entrepreneurs and professionals.

Network and learn with industry peers. Learn More   Liron Azrielant is occasionally mistaken for an assistant at Meron Capital, and entrepreneurs showing up at the office ask when the venture capital partner will be available. But she is the cofounder of Meron Capital, along with Daniel Roditi, and they have just announced their second fund, Meron II, with $50 million to invest in Israeli companies. Azrielant and Roditi talked with me about their fund, which will invest in promising entrepreneurs in Israel. Their aim is to be agile and leverage their contacts to build on the success of their first fund, which they set up in 2017. They plan to make 18 to 20 pre-seed and seed investments in startups that are building software-based solutions for enterprise, cybersecurity, digital health, fintech, DevOps, and more. They previously invested in 16 startups, and four of those have exited: AIOps startup Loom Systems was acquired by ServiceNow; API integration platform Reshuffle was acquired by Twitter; digital health company Clear Genetics was purchased by Invitae; and IoT startup Axonize was acquired by Planon. In addition, 10 more have so far raised further financing, with startups Immunai, Solugen, and Armory alone disclosing combined investments in excess of $300 million to date. I talked with Azrielant about her background in the Israeli army, her computer science training, and what she views as her role in inspiring female entrepreneurs. Roditi talked about growing up in Switzerland and then moving to Israel in 2015. The two also talked about the challenge of doing business while Israel was involved in its recent war with Gaza, how they’re inspired by resilient entrepreneurs, and how they expect Israel to continue its reputation as the Startup Nation under the new prime minister, Naftali Bennett. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Liron Azrielant and Daniel Roditi have created a second $50 million fund.Image Credit: Meron/Nir Slakman VentureBeat: Could you tell me about your backgrounds and how long you’ve been doing this investing? Liron Azrielant: I’ve known Danny for more than five years now. We were both part of the investment team at Blumberg Capital. We’ve been investing together since 2015. In my personal career, I started as part of a program called Talpiot. It’s a program in the Israeli army. You’ve probably heard of it. Quite a few startups came out of it, like Pagaya. I finished it while serving full time in Israeli intelligence, part of a unit developing new tools to obtain information. After my release, which was also after I graduated, I joined Agilent Technologies, where I was working on communication protocols. At that point I was still on the engineering side, a hardcore techie, with the intention of becoming more technical. I decided to pursue a master’s in computer science at MIT. I ended up combining that with an MBA, and that drew me more into the business side. After graduating I joined Bain in Atlanta and was part of their private equity group. That drew me into the world of investment, at first in private equity. I was doing pre-deal due diligence for large companies. After a few years I moved to New York and joined PwC’s dedicated M&A group. After six years in the States I made two decisions. One was that I wanted to move to the buy side, and two, I wanted to come back to Israel. At first I looked at more private equity stuff, but I decided what I was really excited about was early stage. I ended up joining Blumberg Capital, which is when I met Danny and our mutual journey began. Daniel Roditi: I’m originally from Geneva, Switzerland. I moved to Israel in 2015, which is pretty much when I met Liron. Before that I started my career in Geneva in private banking, the advisory side of the Rothschild Bank, doing mostly bonds, equity structured products. It was nice, but extremely boring. Then I went on to study in the U.S., came back to Europe to go to Greece during the previous crisis, where I was working in commodity trading in Athens, which was an interesting time. There was 65% unemployment in my age group. I was doing back-to-back trading on wheat, corn, barley, soybeans between Greece and other European countries, South America, and Asia. I decided to join a startup that was solving one of the big pain points I dealt with working in commodity trading, which was business intelligence and transparency over prices. It was a very over-the-counter market. I was employee number one on the business front at AgFlow, a startup in commodity trading back in Geneva. It was still a boring city, but a more exciting challenge. I was there, built the entire business team, built the entire sales pipeline, and then eventually decided to leave to come to Israel. I had a finance background, and I had a software and technology background, deploying software. I decided to combine both of those by coming here. I came to do an MBA at Tel Aviv University in 2015. That’s when I met Liron and joined Blumberg as part of the investment team. Together we left in December of 2016 to found Meron Capital. Above: Meron Capital’s portfolio.Image Credit: Meron Capital VentureBeat: It seems like this whole “startup nation” image around Israel has accelerated. Does that give you the confidence that focusing on Israel is the important thing to do? Azrielant: We’re deep tech investors, and we believe there’s no better place than Israel to invest in deep tech. The stuff that I personally was studying and implementing in the army, it was far more advanced than anything I studied in any corporation or at the university. Israel is a place where, at 18, a large percentage of the population picks up training that’s relevant for a wide array of technologies. If you think about intelligence, it’s cyber. It’s about stealing information and preventing it from being stolen. Once you have the information, it’s about understanding what to do with it. NLP, deep learning, pattern analysis, everything that narrows down information that’s too big to listen or read through and understanding the key parts. Image recognition. This is relevant for so many industries. Anything that has to do with infrastructure, databases, these are all things that we learn and employ in the army. It just gives Israel such a huge edge. I’m not even talking about getting a lot of responsibility at a young age, getting this can-do attitude. People at 18 don’t pick that up so often in other places. Also, there’s this sort of self-fulfilling prophecy we’ve seen. Israel has been identified as a hotbed for startups, which in turn causes companies to open more development centers here, strengthening the talent. Corporations look at Israeli companies as targets for acquisition. That in turn creates more successful entrepreneurs, investors, and mentors for the new generation. It only strengthens and increases the potential of these companies to succeed. Roditi: It’s accelerating, as you said. This is also due to recent trends we’ve seen and what’s happened in the past few years. First of all, what happened with corona. We realized that Israel was pandemic-proof in its DNA. Most of our companies are not exposed to consumers. They’re targeting other businesses or infrastructure. That made them flourish in that period of time. Two, what we saw with Softbank and WeWork and these types of movements in the ecosystem, we’re also quite proof against that. Most of the companies we invest in, most of the biggest successes in Israel, are capital-efficient with high profit margins. There’s no WeWork effect. There’s also a maturity in the ecosystem today. That comes with what Liron mentioned, and also comes with more big companies coming out of Israel. Startup nation, scale-up nation, these are things we hear, but actually today it’s becoming quite apparent that more and more companies here are multi-billion-dollar companies. They’re strengthening the ecosystem from the ground up. VentureBeat: I see some of the success stories you had from the previous fund. Can you talk about some of those and why they were significant? Azrielant: Our first investment and second exit was Loom Systems. They sold to ServiceNow. The biggest story there — and this is also something we use as a north star when we look at a company to invest in — is resilience. Loom is a great company, but I don’t think that’s the reason they succeeded. It’s that the entire founding team, and especially the CEO — when it was hard, when it wasn’t looking like it was going anywhere, they got through the tough times and brought the company to such a successful state that it had multiple offers. It taught us a lot about what to look for in a founder and what really leads to success. Roditi: Just in terms of baselines, we have four exits out of a portfolio of 16 companies in four years. Twenty-five percent of the portfolio has been acquired, which is completely crazy when you look at the global statistics. Above: Meron Capital is focusing on Israeli entrepreneurs.Image Credit: Meron Capital VentureBeat: Does the word “Meron” mean something, by the way? Azrielant: There’s a mountain called Meron in Israel. I wish we had a more meaningful story, but honestly we were just going back and forth on names we liked and domains that were available. Because we were such a new, up-and-coming fund, and we were trying to gain authority, we chose a name that sounds like something that was there before. Canaan is a fund. There used to be a fund called Carmel. Meron is a very known mountain in Israel, so we thought it conveyed a sense of stability. Roditi: I’m Swiss, so I have mountains deep in my heart. I’m happy to connect that to my DNA. VentureBeat: $50 million seems like a good amount. What are you targeting as far as the usual size of the investments? Azrielant: Between half a million and $2.5 million. We’re focusing specifically on the pre-seed and seed companies. We want to be the first institutional money in. As for the size of the fund, despite the trend that you’re seeing now with valuations going higher and exit sizes growing bigger, it was important for us to have a fund where the dynamics make sense even if that reality changes. When we went through the numbers in Israel, we saw that there’s this layer of unicorns that you now see, which is fairly new, but in the past 10 years, Israel has been extremely overindexed in exits between $100 million and $500 million. In some years, the chances of a company getting any funding at all to being acquired at above $100 million were 1 in 25. In bad years it was 1 in 40. These are odds you really want to play, and having a $50 million fund allows us to return the entire fund with even just one exit like that. This is also something that we baked into our strategy. Roditi: It’s also core to our culture that we want to be aligned with our funders. When you have a fund that’s $200 million, you have 10% of a company, and they get an offer of $500 million, you’d return 50 out of 200. That would be great for you as a fund, still. Often partners tend to push entrepreneurs to not take offers, and instead take more financing and grow the company bigger to make their returns more worthwhile. We don’t want to be in that position. We want to optimize our alignment of interests with our founders to the best of our ability. Having a fund size that’s limited in capacity is the best way to do that. VentureBeat: When were you raising the fund and closing the money? Azrielant: We made our last investment out of Meron 1 in Q1, or maybe just the beginning of Q2 in 2020. We started fundraising for Meron 2 around August, but we were lucky enough to do some investments in a warehousing structure, so our first investment out of Meron 2 was in September 2020. The period between August and June was what I refer to with Danny’s resilience. He kept us pushing and working and hustling. It wasn’t an easy period for us. But we were lucky to be able to make investments in that period. Above: Meron Capital supports Israel’s Startup Nation image.Image Credit: Meron/Nir Slakman VentureBeat: I’m guessing it was not easy to raise money during the pandemic. Roditi: We raised all the money without face-to-face meetings, almost. Which was interesting. How do we build trust, especially for that? We strongly believe that trust is the most important element, trust and respect. How do we build those over Zoom? That’s something we had to work around and still create meaningful relationships with our investors and bring them in. It was challenging, but honestly it was super cool. I enjoyed the process. Azrielant: We had one very significant investor that never invests without meeting face to face. We were at the brink of applying for a special visa to travel into Germany just to meet him. But eventually we were able to generate enough trust without having to travel. VentureBeat: Have you noticed anything different about the startups you see now coming out of the pandemic? Azrielant: The seed rounds have continued to increase. We’ve seen $5 million, $6 million, $7 million — there was one $26 million seed by a repeat founder. We’re seeing that more and more. There’s also a bit of a dichotomy where startups that start out with a certain — either they’re repeat founders, or they have an easier time starting, and then there’s a bit of a gap in the early stage, the pre-seed and seed. To us, it’s great, because we feel like we’re playing right before where all of the craziness begins. We’re able to identify just the sheer raw talent of the founders and teams before they become super-hyped companies. It’s hard, because the scene keeps changing, but we feel like our window of opportunity, that gap in the market, is significant right now. VentureBeat: I know you had the recent trouble in Gaza. Has that had any sort of impact on being able to do business? Roditi: We had a very significant commitment come in on the Tuesday everything started. We received that commitment from European investors for whom-it would be their first investment in Israel. They didn’t have a special affiliation to Israel and were doing it for purely financial reasons. They gave us the commitment on Tuesday, early in the afternoon, and then Tuesday night we started being bombarded out of Gaza. I was afraid that would jeopardize the commitment, but they signed and moved forward with the investment with no issue. In the end, in Israel, people know that it happens like this. It’s cyclical. It’s not going to impact the industry at large. For the rest of the world, I think there’s — it changes, a bit, their approach to Israel, although not significantly enough for it to impact us. Azrielant: We had alarms going off during Zoom meetings. It’s weird to say that we’re used to it, because something like this happens every few years, but we are. The toughest part was trying to communicate to our partners that for us, it’s just business as usual. We’re going to keep focusing on the business. It’s not as severe as it sounds, even if we have to hang up and run for shelter in the middle of a meeting. VentureBeat: It feels like a lot of investment is built on that trust and comfort level. When you have a war going on, it has an impact. Somehow Israel has done this through its whole history. Roditi: You’re right. Anybody who invests in an environment is going to look at it from a risk-reward perspective. War increases the risk aspect, both because it increases the geopolitical risk, and because people, especially those who don’t have an affiliation to Israel, feel like there’s some layer of political gesture to investing in Israel when it’s at war. Perfectly aligning with this — I think it’s our job to manage this correctly. VentureBeat: This also seems to come at a time when there’s political or governmental instability. It’s interesting that life still carries on. Roditi: Yes, absolutely. Azrielant: The potential, if all things go well — I’m assuming you know the background of Naftali Bennett, the new prime minister. He’s the founder of a very large high-tech company [Cyota, sold to RSA for $145 million in 2005]. We’re pretty excited about — despite each of us having our own opinions on his political standings, the entire industry is very excited to have a high-tech startup veteran as prime minister. We believe that he’ll understand the complexity and the needs of the industry. VentureBeat: Did any of that make you consider whether you wanted to expand the region in which you invest and mitigate risk that way? Roditi: No, or at least not me. It’s about maintaining and being aware of our competitive advantage. That competitive advantage is to be part of this ecosystem, to be entrenched in this ecosystem, to be able to scan all of it and do due diligence on founders here. If we were to expand and start investing in Europe or the U.S., we’d let go of that competitive advantage, which I think is key to being successful. Azrielant: I think I’d rather invest in founders that have managed the uncertainty of having to run to shelter, or not knowing if they can make a business meeting because of political unrest. They’ll be so much more prepared when exit discussions go south, or when they’re trying to win their best clients and manage negotiations. Roditi: For these guys, entrepreneurs, when they decide to create a company, they also go through that process of assessing risk and reward. If they see increased risk and still go for the reward, these are typically the type of guys that we want to finance. Above: Tel Aviv, IsraelImage Credit: iStock / Dance60 VentureBeat: Do you place your own importance on being able to meet face to face with startups that you invest with? Azrielant: During the corona crisis, we had to have a lot of the meetings in Zoom. Still, we found ways to meet the founders we chose to invest in at least once. Whether it was meeting outdoors at a coffee shop, or whatever was allowed — I think we got better at creating the initial relationship remotely, but we’re trying not to cut out the face to face element completely. The same with the war. We found places that have shelters or secure spaces, and if the alarm goes off, we’re already there. Roditi: With regards to face-to-face meetings, as opposed to larger funds or growth stage funds — they have a lot of data to rely on when they do due diligence on companies. They have a lot of quantitative information and visibility into a company’s products and so on. We’re really investing in the entrepreneurs. We take that leap of faith on entrepreneurs before they have a product, and sometimes before they even have an idea. We work with them on that. Our job is much more qualitative than quantitative. It’s very personal. We need to make sure we can sit on the same side of the table with this entrepreneur for the next 10 years. In our case, I don’t think we — I wouldn’t say never would we invest without meeting face to face. I think we would have. We may very well do it in the future. But this element and this chemistry is very important to us. VentureBeat: What sort of predictions might you make about what you expect to see unfold in technology, especially in Israel? Azrielant: I do think that inherently capital-efficient companies will continue to overperform. We’ve seen quite a few physical startups growing, like Uber, like WeWork, but I do think software technology startups are going to be the main drivers of value, especially now that we’ve seen what happens when the physical aspect of the world drops completely. Roditi: A few things are happening in the world where Israel is positioning itself very well. Israel’s real DNA in terms of how entrepreneurs work is that they’re very strong technically. Until now, it made a lot of sense to go for very technical places, like deep learning and AI and cybersecurity, which is mostly what Israel is known for. Today we see a lot more technology in all sorts of businesses. We see that talent being attracted to this. One of the big ones that has yet to be disrupted by technology is health care. There’s a huge opportunity there with computational biology, which is based on software. Software in health care is going to boom, and we’ll see that more in Israel. Fintech is also becoming more technical, more deeply integrated, and I think we see that with embedded fintech. We see that with tech for finance companies. We’re also going to see a lot of developments in the fintech space. Cyber, of course, is seeing a big resurgence right now. We’re also very well-positioned for frontier technologies like quantum computing. VentureBeat: Are there things you might stay away from? I don’t know if games or cryptocurrency are interesting to you. Roditi: I would rather not say we’d stay away. One of our competitive advantages, one of the things that defines us specifically, is that we’re young and agile. I’m always going to be open to investing in new places, depending on what the industry is coming up with, and responding to the market very quickly. We won’t invest in arms, tobacco, gambling, or things where we don’t feel a strong ethical parallel with our own standards. Azrielant: In the broader sense I think I wouldn’t invest in anything that I think has a negative impact on the world. Those are just some obvious ones. But a good example is we saw companies that we really liked, that had great numbers, in the area of medication adherence. But as we dug down into it, we felt like it might have an element of reinforcing drug dependency. The overall impact of what that company does might not be for the best. We didn’t feel like that was a product the world should have. We always prefer technologies that make the world better, and we’ll avoid completely technologies that we feel are reinforcing problems or promoting problematic things. VentureBeat: Related to that question, where do you expect to invest a lot? Are there sectors that are clearly where more money might go? Azrielant: Personally I’m the most excited about fintech, from multiple angles. B2B payments is a huge area that both Danny and I are excited about, but also tools, selling to CFOs, to the controllers. We feel that unlike, say, cybersecurity — while there’s still a huge need for it, CSOs are being marketed to nonstop. There’s still a big gap in offering tools to the CFO in an organization. In addition, similar to what Danny said about trends, anything that has to do with health care, precision medicine, matching the right treatment to the right person, trying to use software and algorithms to treat people better. VentureBeat: Are there a lot of other woman-run companies in Israel, in the venture industry there? Azrielant: Not at all. It has its ups and downs. In a lot of ways I feel fortunate. I feel like standing out helps. But it also means that I had to work harder to get to where I was. It doesn’t happen anymore, but when I was just starting out — Liron, my name, it’s a unisex name. I’ve had founders walking into the office and asking, “Oh, when will Liron arrive?” Honestly, for both of us, not just being a woman but also being young and appearing young — we’ve had people asking, “Is a decision-maker here? Who else is on your investment committee?” It’s this rapport you need to build from scratch over and over again. But I do feel that after all the hard work of making a name for ourselves and standing out, it’s starting to no longer be a disadvantage. We’re starting to reap the fruits of that work. People do tend to remember us more and recognize us more. That’s a tool that’s been great for us, especially when we’re trying to show our work and our value to our founders. Roditi: Liron is being quite humble, but she’s actually a great figure in the Israeli ecosystem, especially for being a woman founding partner of a fund. What we see here, and I guess it’s something that you also realize in your day to day, there’s a lot of funds that have multiple partners. Recently, because there’s been a lot of light shed on women partnerships in funds being so low in terms of percentage, they’re promoting female partners, often in operation roles rather than investment roles. Sometimes they’ll bring them in in investment roles, but as a fifth partner, sixth partner. Liron built the fund from the ground up herself, which is something that’s not — it’s more than rare. Above: Tel Aviv, IsraelImage Credit: israeltourism/Flickr VentureBeat: When you have some of those awkward situations happening, how do you respond? Azrielant: I didn’t do it, but one thing I really wanted to do is serve that person coffee and tell him, “Liron will be right in. Here’s a good tip about Liron. He really likes when you read about him before a meeting. Please use this time to do some research.” But no, honestly, I just smile and correct and try to focus on not taking it personally, staying professional. Danny has the same thing because of his age. A lot of professionals have these things you have to overcome. This is mine, and I try to smile through it. Roditi: It happens less and less now, because of years of work and presence in the ecosystem. Azrielant: Now most founders that come to us know who we are beforehand, which is something we’re extremely proud of. It was hard to come up with — Meron Capital, which was nothing a second ago, is now on the list of funds you want to approach. VentureBeat: Are you noticing more women entrepreneurs in Israel? Azrielant: Yes, definitely. Danny and I just had a long discussion about this yesterday. I’ll tell you a story about my grandfather. When I was five or six years old, every time I visited my grandfather he’d say, “When are you bringing the Mercedes home?” That was the prize for being a beauty queen in Israel, so that was his way of complimenting me. When my brother, who was six years younger, grew up, I noticed my grandfather would say, “Are you going to be a lawyer or an engineer?” In my generation, there was a difference in expectations. It’s being corrected more and more. What I’ve seen coming in the last few years, and I’m super excited about it, is we’ve had that awareness about the difference in expectations between the genders for long enough that it’s suddenly kicking on. Suddenly women founders have had this new expectation of them for long enough to go study, take great steps, and start their own companies. Compared to five years ago when we started investing, we’ve seen so many more top women founders that we’re excited to invest in. Our latest investment, Sorbet, is woman-led. Also, our fourth investment and first exit was woman-led. They’re both awesome. Roditi: We have a statistically woman-heavy portfolio, although that’s really not by design. I also think that from the entrepreneur’s side, seeing that we’re a fund that has a woman in leadership makes women more comfortable working with us. I can’t say for sure if that’s true, but I’ve heard — Sorbet, when I was doing the deal, it’s something the entrepreneur mentioned. I’m guessing, but I think it’s important that we show we have that culture in-house. Azrielant: We always invest in the best person, the best company that we meet. We have a fiduciary duty to our investors. But we’re so excited that so often that person happens to be a woman. We hope that this trend grows stronger. VentureBeat: As a society, do you feel like Israel is any more likely to produce women entrepreneurs than elsewhere? Azrielant: Absolutely, for two reasons. One is the military. Men and women, every person at the age of 18 goes into the military. The way that people are sorted into units, guys tend to take combat roles a little more often than women, even though a lot of the combat roles are also open to women. What’s left, the technological roles, are open enough — not enough of them are 50-50, but a lot of them are. There’s this crazy tech training that women receive. Second, I think it’s changing a bit now, but Israel is so deep into — the culture is very much a meritocracy. In the U.S., when they look at your resume, they may care more about whether you worked at a top company, the logos you can put there. In Israel it’s more about what languages you can code, what you can technically do. Those things tend to have a lot less of a gender flag. Do you know Python? Are you good at Python? That drives respect and promotion. Roditi: It’s funny, because my brother, the other day we were talking about gender in Israel. He said, “Israel, to me, is the most feminist country on the planet. Look, already, just the first names, in Hebrew so many names are both for men and women, like Liron.” When you think about this, it’s a little crazy, the number of names in Israeli society that are used for both men and women. You really only see that here. It’s funny coming from — my brother is Swiss and he still works there, so he has limited visibility into Israel. But that was something that impacted his vision of it. If you say a name in Israel, it could be for both genders. There’s no differentiation. VentureBeat: Is there anything else you’d like to mention? Azrielant: We like to work with founders for a long time. More often than not, the founders we end up investing in, we met them long before the investment. I know you keep hearing this, but we like lines, not dots. Almost all of our deals, we’ve had very significant discussions with founders. Some of them were actually around, “I don’t think that idea is good enough. I’d like to help you validate something different.” This is because we go early stage. We invest in people. For us to make an investment, we don’t necessarily have to be in love with the idea or the specific solution that the founder is pursuing. We just need a strong enough founder approaching an interesting enough problem. That’s helped us identify a lot of strong founders when there’s crazy competition.

Silver Spring, MD, June 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --… [+5730 chars]",Yahoo Entertainment,"Next-generation Proof-of-Stake validation is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional resource-intensive crypto miningSilver Spring, MD, June 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BTCS Inc. (OTCQB: BTCS) (“BTCS” or the “Company”), a blockchain technology focused company, today announced the expansion of its blockchain infrastructure segment with the launch of a new staking operation on Cardano, a decentralized third-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain launched by ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson.“Recent price volatility in the digital asset space, which we consider immaterial to long-term use cases, has provided tremendous opportunity to grow our revenue-generating staking operations,” stated Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. “Based on a detailed evaluation of key characteristics and metrics, we selected Cardano as the next addition to our staking program. We believe that Cardano’s blockchain quality, revenue potential, and technical difficulty provide a tremendous opportunity, and with existing as well as planned capabilities, we believe its token (ADA) is undervalued relative to its peer group.”BTCS has deployed its own Cardano pool and pledged approximately 258,000 Cardano tokens (ADA). Staking is the environmentally-friendly technology used to process and validate digital asset transactions on Cardano, Kusama, Tezos, Ethereum 2.0, and other next-generation blockchains.While it shares characteristics and applications with other blockchain platforms, Cardano distinguishes itself through a commitment to peer-reviewed scientific research as building blocks for updates to its platform. One of Cardano’s applications is identity management, used to streamline and simplify processes that require the collection of data from multiple sources, and traceability, used to track and audit a product’s manufacturing processes from provenance to finished goods, addressing the challenge of counterfeit goods. The Cardano platform also has a goal of providing banking services to the world’s unbanked population, an estimated market of 1.7 billion individuals according to The World Bank.Story continues“Cardano has a leg up on many other altcoins because it lays out use cases across education, retail, agriculture, government, finance, and healthcare,” added Michal Handerhan, COO of BTCS. “Cardano’s undeniable strength rests in its focus on blockchain-based identity and traceability management solutions and creating a plausible decentralized financial system for the developing world instead of trying to target the entire smart-contract market.”“Given that Cardano’s team has real firepower on board to make the goals a reality, and have several foundations filled with talented people doing the legwork, Cardano has a real shot at adoption in key markets,” continued BTCS CEO Charles Allen. “Cardano represents a significant opportunity for investment should its financial ecosystem begin to take hold within the markets it is seeking to impact.”About BTCS:BTCS is an early mover in the blockchain and digital currency ecosystems and the first “Pure Play” U.S. publicly traded company focused on blockchain infrastructure and technology. The Company through its blockchain infrastructure operation secures ethereum’s and cardano’s proof-of-stake blockchains by actively processing and validating blockchain transactions and is rewarded with digital assets. The Company is developing a proprietary staking-as-a-service platform to allow users to stake and delegate supported cryptocurrencies through a non-custodial platform. The Company is also developing a proprietary digital asset data analytics platform that allows users to consolidate their crypto trades from multiple exchanges onto a single platform, enabling users to view and analyze their performance, risk metrics, and potential tax implications. The Company employs a digital asset treasury strategy with a primary focus on disruptive non-security protocol layer assets such as bitcoin and ethereum.

Government of Canada to bring high-speed internet to hundreds of homes in Zimmerman and areas north of Burlington Yesterday, the Government of Canada announced it’s investing over $1.3 million to bring high-speed internet to 329 more homes in Zimmerman and areas north of Burlington. The investment is a part of the Universal Broadband Fund’s (UBF) Rapid Response Stream, which has a budget of up to $150 million. The stream aims to enhance household access to high-speed internet in the very short term or before November 15, 2021 to address immediate broadband needs. UBF is the federal government’s $2.75 billion investment designed to help connect all Canadians to high-speed internet. Applications to the UBF were accepted until March 15, 2021, and are now being evaluated, the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) noted in a press release. A suite of federal investments to improve high-speed internet, UBF includes the Connect to Innovate program – which is expected to connect nearly 400,000 households by 2023 – and the recently announced $2 billion broadband initiative from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

The new features make it easier for small businesses to expand and reach additional clients, according to the company.  The marketplace integration uses GoDaddy’s Websites + Marketing site builder combined with e-commerce tools to let businesses list their products and manage orders and shipping across different platforms from one place. Users don’t need to login to each marketplace to track what they have sold, what needs to be shipped or restocked. Inventory is also automatically adjusted and synced as people buy products to ensure overselling out-of-stock items will not be a problem. In addition to the new Amazon and eBay features, GoDaddy has launched features to make it easier for business owners to connect their stores to social media. The Instagram integration allows users to schedule and publish posts on Instagram while monitoring activity through the Websites + Marketing dashboard.

The breakdown of the $100 million includes a $60 million commitment from 2018 under the Ontario Liberal Party. None of the $60 million has been put towards anything since 2018, Betakit noted in a recent article. The additional $40 million is new funding. The new Venture Ontario Fund, to be overseen by the province’s venture capital agency Ontario Capital Growth Corporation (OCGC), will be dispersing the $100 million to venture capital funds with a focus on high-growth sectors, including sciences, medical devices, IT, AI and clean technology, according to a June 9 news release.

Beyond the city level, many national governments and international organizations have also adopted smart city development as a key policy priority. However, until now, there has been a lack of global coherence around this concept, in particular in terms of the following two fundamentals, according to WCCD:  A general lack of clarity on the definition of what a “smart city” truly is. A lack of internationally-standardized indicators to measure progress, drive smart city investment, drive city-to-city learning and create tools for year-over-year benchmarking.  WCCD says it’s operationalized ISO 37122 indicators for smart cities globally to address these urgent needs, thereby coordinating the global effort to build open, high-calibre, independently verified and globally comparable city data. Cities successfully ISO 37120 certified and part of the WCCD global network are eligible for ISO 37122 certification and positioned to lead in smart city development globally with ISO standardized, comparative, and independently verified city data. These are essential starting points for smart city development. ISO 37120 includes 104 key performance indicators (KPIs) across 19 themes – all prioritized by cities to measure performance on city services and quality of life, according to WCCD.

Data on Tuesday showed U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in May, with spending rotating back to services from goods as vaccinations allow Americans to shake off COVID-19 restrictions.  read more  But robust demand is outpacing supply, stoking inflation, with several recent readings of inflation gauges - including  the producer price index released on Tuesday - signaling rising price pressures.  read more  ""The U.S. dollar kept firm as another hot reading on inflation overshadowed a chilly consumer,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The Fed's two-day meeting was set to end on Wednesday and it is due to issue a policy statement afterward. So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have said rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time. Recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal. ""Assuming that some of the recent increase in inflation is indeed sustained, we would argue that the Fed will react to it, supporting the USD later this year,"" analysts at BofA Global Research said in note. Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter.  read more  The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.04% higher at 90.529, after rising as high as 90.677, its highest since May 14.

The British currency was last down 0.18% against the greenback. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin  hovered around the $40,000 level, a day after it climbed above that mark for the first time in more than two weeks, aided by the promise of fresh investment from major backer MicroStrategy and an upbeat tweet from Tesla (TSLA.O) boss Elon Musk.

McAfee linked the charges filed by the Internal Revenue Service to his failed bid to run as a Libertarian Party candidate in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a second such attempt. ""In late 2018, I announced I would run again and I also announced I would target the IRS and its corruption and two months later the IRS filed charged against me,"" he told the Spanish High Court during the first hearing of his extradition trial. ""I believe the charges are politically motivated."" McAfee added that that given his age, almost 76, he would spend the rest of his life in jail if he were to be convicted in the United States. ""I am hoping that the Spanish court will see the injustice of this,"" he said, adding ""the United States wants to use me as an example."" In Washington, the IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Spanish prosecutor, Carlos Bautista, dismissed the claim of political motivations, insisting the Libertarian Party rarely gains more than 1% of votes in U.S. elections. ""He is a tax rebel, nothing else. A millionaire who doesn't want to pay taxes,"" Bautista said. ""He will benefit from all guarantees of due process."" McAfee was arrested at Barcelona airport in early October when he was about to board a flight to Istanbul with a British passport. U.S. federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment in October against McAfee over charges that he evaded taxes and wilfully failed to file returns. That came shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed it had brought civil charges against McAfee, alleging he made over $23.1 million in undisclosed income from false and misleading cryptocurrency recommendations. The Spanish prosecutor said McAfee could be extradited, but only to face charges related to his tax returns of 2016, 2017 and 2018.",2021-06-15

People don’t care,” Bernstein told CNBC’s Trading Nation this week.   “We’ve got this major bull market going on in commodities, and all people are saying is that it doesn’t matter,” he added.Oil has indeed been on the rise for several weeks now, spurred by reopening economies that have pushed up demand considerably. Benchmarks hit the highest in three years this week as the prospect of Iranian oil returning to markets and changing the supply and demand dynamics became a little more distant than it was last week.  However, even last week, when the chances of additional supply from Iran seemed greater, oil was trending higher as the strength of demand recovery more than offset any possible worry of excessive supply. If anything, there have been warnings of supply tightness and even higher prices. The near-term outlook is also very bullish.

I daresay you haven't had much practice. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
 - The Queen, Alice's Adventures in Wonderlan… [+88748 chars]",Seeking Alpha,"The most frequent way that investors come to believe in impossible things is that they fail to impose ""equilibrium."" They neglect to examine how output and securities come into existence, the arithmetic that dictates how they have to add up, and who ends up with what after each exchange. They imagine that what might be true for an individual investor or sector must also be true for the financial markets or the economy as a whole. Discussions of economics and finance typically reflect little consideration or even understanding of the ""stock-flow equilibrium"" that necessarily relates various real economic outcomes - output, savings, investment, and government spending - with the issuance of various financial objects like Treasury debt, base money, and stock shares. Equilibrium is like conservation of mass - every purchase is also a sale; every security that's created must be held by someone until it is retired; securities are created to memorialize obligations; output that's not consumed has been saved; the shortfall of one sector must be the surplus of another. Once you insist on thinking in terms of equilibrium, it becomes obvious how many discussions in economics and finance are incoherent. Notably, the lack of equilibrium thinking obscures a critical fact about investing: every security, once issued, must be held by someone until it is retired. As a result, the only thing that a security will ever provide to its investors, in aggregate, is the stream of actual cash flows that it delivers between the point that it is issued and the point that it is retired. The price changes called out by Mr. Market are not changes in aggregate wealth - they mainly provide varying opportunities for wealth transfer between one investor and another. There's an increase in aggregate wealth only if there's an increase in expected value-added output and deliverable cash flows. Otherwise, a change in the valuation of a given stream of cash flows merely reflects a change in the expected rate of return.  Imagine that some in some private business you own a small share that cost you $1,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is very obliging indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or sell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of value appears plausible and justified by business developments and prospects as you know them. Often, on the other hand, Mr. Market lets his enthusiasm or fears run away with him, and the value he proposes seems to you a little short of silly. You may be happy to sell out to him when he quotes you a ridiculously high price, and equally happy to buy from him when his price is low. But the rest of the time you will be wiser to form your own ideas of the value of your holdings, based on full reports from the company about its operation and financial position. - Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor  We'll begin with an overview of market conditions and move on to a discussion of securities, wealth, money creation, fiscal policy, inflation, the Phillips Curve, Bitcoin, market valuations, free enterprise, natural monopoly, and economic growth. I've briefly included several charts and points that are familiar to long-time readers - more detail can be found in prior commentaries. My hope is that by the end of this comment, you'll have a more coherent sense of how they all interact. Ideally, this comment will serve as something of a reference - if only so future investors might avoid the sort of misperception that has contributed to the current extremes. Market conditions I'll note at the outset that understanding how the relationships between money, finance, and the economy actually work may not help your investment process unless you also accept (as we finally did in late-2017) the extent to which the discomfort of investors with zero interest rates has blunted their capacity for discernment. Amid zero interest rates, historically reliable ""limits"" to speculation have not applied. That's not to say that the current speculative extremes will escape profoundly damaging consequences. It's just that we have to be selective in our disdain. In particular, we have to be content to gauge the presence or absence of speculation or risk-aversion, without assuming that there is a limit to either. When investors form their expectations for returns based on price behavior, and price behavior is driven by investor expectations in turn, the feedback loop contributes to self-reinforcing bubbles. The situation is worse when investors ignore valuations in hopes of limitless ""support"" from policymakers, despite the absence of any reliable, mechanistic relationship - other than psychology itself - linking policy actions and security prices. The chart below shows the ratio of nonfinancial market capitalization to corporate gross value-added, including estimated foreign revenues. This is the valuation measure that we find best correlated with actual subsequent market returns across a century of market cycles, as well as in recent decades.  Presently, we estimate clearly negative average annual total returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the coming 12-year period. The scatter below reflects two of our most reliable valuation measures: nonfinancial market capitalization to corporate gross value-added (including estimated foreign revenues) in data since 1950. I've extended the chart back to 1928 by setting valuations in proportion to our margin-adjusted P/E (MAPE) in data prior to 1950. The valuation of the U.S. stock market on May 7, 2021, was easily the highest level in history.  The scatter below reflects data since 1947, showing our Margin-Adjusted P/E (MAPE), MarketCap/GDP, and MarketCap/GVA versus actual subsequent 12-year S&amp;P 500 total returns. These are among the valuation measures we find best correlated with actual subsequent market returns. Notice that each is normalized so that 1.0 on the horizontal axis represents the historical norm. Not surprisingly, when valuations have been near their historical norms, subsequent returns have averaged something close to 10% annually. That's what we mean when we discuss the ""mapping"" between valuations and subsequent returns. What drives ""errors"" in this mapping? Errors are produced mainly when valuations at the end of a given holding period are very far from their historical norm, at least temporarily. For example, if current valuation extremes were sustained at these levels even 12 years from today, the average annual total return of the S&amp;P 500 over that period would likely be in the low single digits, rather than the negative return that we presently expect. That low, but the positive return would quite likely be associated with substantial interim volatility because extreme valuations are typically followed by high volatility, as prices become more sensitive to small changes in expected returns. Still, we can't rule out future bubbles, so even at current extremes, we have to navigate and respond to market conditions as they change.  It's important to recognize that while valuations are extremely informative about prospective market returns on a 10-12 year horizon, and potential market losses over the completion of any market cycle, but valuations are not reliable short-term measures. If elevated valuations were enough to drive the market lower, we could never observe the sort of extremes that emerged in 1929, 2000, and today. Over shorter horizons, we have to attend to whether investors are inclined toward speculation or risk-aversion, and we find that this psychology is best gauged by the uniformity or divergence of market internals across thousands of individual stocks, industries, sectors, and security types, including debt securities of varying creditworthiness. Presently, our key gauge of market internals is also unfavorable, while market conditions are extremely overextended, which creates the potential for ""trap door"" outcomes. We've seen this combination a few times in recent years, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2020. Based on statistical proximity, we find that the ""nearest neighbors"" to current extremes were in 1987 and 1998, just before ""panic"" type declines, neither of which was accompanied by a recession. Even amid these extremes, we've patiently refrained from ""fighting"" this speculation aggressively until we observe broader deterioration in the equity components of internals. For now, the main divergences on the equity side take the form of progressively weaker participation, leadership, and price-volume behavior with each successive market advance. While Wall Street is clearly enthusiastic about an enormous post-pandemic recovery, keep in mind that the U.S. government has run a deficit amounting to about 19% of GDP over the past year. Undoubtedly, we'll see a broad recovery in private sector economic activity in the quarters ahead. But this recovery will also have to replace, rather than augment, trillions of dollars in pandemic relief funds. The recovery will progress amid substantial labor market frictions as well as shortages in various production inputs. It's quite possible that the mental image in anticipation of a post-pandemic recovery may be more pleasant than the actual recovery itself. In that event, the glowing optimism currently built into record valuation extremes could be followed by quite a bit of disappointment. This is not a market that is priced for the smallest shred of disappointment. Below, we've sorted S&amp;P 500 into 10 deciles, by price/revenue ratio (thanks as usual to our resident math guru Russell Jackson for compiling all of this data). Each line shows the median price/revenue ratio of each decile. Keep in mind that the lowest valuation deciles typically represent companies in industries such as retail and industrials, while the highest valuation deciles typically represent companies in industries like information technology and medical devices. So each line is best compared with its own history. Presently, every one of these deciles is at the most extreme level in history (unlike the 2000 peak, when there was far more dispersion across valuations). This is breathtaking, and I don't expect it to end well.  Still, even here, we can't assume that speculative recklessness has a well-defined limit. An improvement in our gauge of market internals, either at current valuation levels, or ideally at lower ones, would encourage a more neutral outlook (though certainly with a safety net in any event). That would not relieve the dismal long-term prospects for stocks - I expect this bubble to collapse like every bubble that has preceded it. Still, if one adaptation has been necessary for the face of zero interest rate policies, it's that speculation should not be aggressively fought with an outright bearish outlook except when growing dispersion and divergence in market action suggests that the ""bit"" has dropped out of investors' teeth. We'll take that evidence as it emerges. As a side note, it's endlessly fascinating to me that investors imagine that decades of zero interest rate policies by the Bank of Japan have somehow held stocks at a ""permanently high plateau."" As an advisor to the Bank of Japan, my late friend and dissertation advisor Ronald McKinnon at Stanford argued - even 30 years ago - against the sort of ""financial repression"" it was pursuing. Ben Bernanke encouraged the opposite. In the span of more than 30 years since the December 1989 speculative peak, Japan's real GDP growth has averaged less than 1% annually. Meanwhile, the Nikkei has produced a total return of zero, but not without three separate losses exceeding 60% each, four distinct additional declines in the 30-40% range, and multiple smaller corrections closer to 15-20%. This sort of market outcome is what I've often described as a ""long, interesting trip to nowhere."" Such periods invariably follow record valuation extremes. Recall, for example, that the total return of the S&amp;P 500 lagged Treasury bills during the 18-year period from August 1929 to May 1947, and during the 21-year period from November 1961 to October 1982, and during the 13-year period from March 2000 to April 2013. That's 52 years out of an 84-year span. It's just what happens when valuations become extreme.  In my view, much of the cartoonish behavior that we observe in various markets and asset classes is directly or indirectly Fed-induced. Explosive growth of monetary hot potatoes, coupled with years of zero-interest rates, have fueled an increasingly reckless speculative appetite for alternatives that might escape (or profit from) the Fed's unrestrained activism and financial repression. If we insist on Japan-style monetary dogma, we should be fully prepared for Japan-style outcomes. Every security that is issued must be held by someone until it is retired Consider a world where Alice has $100 of what people call ""cash on the sidelines,"" and Becky owns some stock certificates in ABC. It seems obvious that Alice can take her ""cash on the sidelines"" and instead put her cash ""into the stock market"" by buying 10 shares of ABC stock from Becky at $10 each. These phrases like ""cash on the sidelines"" and ""moving cash into the stock market"" all make sense, as long as we ignore Becky. Unfortunately, the moment we think about Becky, it's clear that both phrases are completely incoherent. Who holds the cash now? Becky. It hasn't somehow moved ""off the sidelines."" Who holds the stock now? Alice. All that has happened is that the owners have changed. In equilibrium, there are no ""sidelines."" The stock market isn't some big jar on Wall Street where money ""flows"" in. Every security that is issued, whether it's base money (currency and bank reserves), or stock shares, or bond certificates, must be held by someone, exactly in the form it was issued, until it is retired. What if Alice buys stock in an initial public offering? Let's work it out. Alice transfers her $100 of cash to Charlie, who has started ABC - his own business. Charlie issues 10 shares to Alice at $10 each. Those new shares are evidence that money has been ""intermediated"" from Alice to Charlie, and in return, Charlie now owes Alice a portion of the cash flows from his business. Where did the cash go? Charlie has it. It didn't disappear. Somebody has to hold the cash until it is retired. The new stock shares memorialize the transaction: they are an asset to Alice and a liability to Charlie. What if Charlie puts the $100 of cash in the bank? Well, now Charlie's bank creates a security, called a ""deposit"" to memorialize the exchange of funds. The deposit is an asset to Charlie and a liability to Charlie's bank. The bank now holds $100 of bank reserves as an asset that ""backs"" Charlie's deposit. There is no more base money than there was before. No net wealth has been created. There's just a new deposit asset, which is also a new deposit liability. What if Charlie's bank lends the $100 of reserves to Deena? Well, a new security is created, called a ""loan certificate"" to memorialize the exchange of funds. The loan is an asset of the bank (which now ""backs"" Charlie's deposit instead of bank reserves), and a liability to Deena. Deena might take the $100 of base money as cash, or she might deposit in the bank as Charlie did. Has the creation of the loan or the deposit created new ""wealth"" or added to economic output? No. There's just a new security, or possibly several (depending on how many times the funds are intermediated), each that represents an asset to one person in the economy and a liability to another. What about price appreciation? What if Deena takes the $100 she borrowed and buys 4 shares of ABC stock from Alice, but now for $25 each? Alice gets back her original $100, she still has 6 shares of ABC, and the market capitalization of ABC has increased. Isn't there more total ""wealth"" in the economy because the price of ABC stock went up? Not unless the expected future value-added output and associated cash flows of ABC have also increased, and that's economic ""wealth"" that will need to be realized in the future. If the higher price merely reflects an increase in valuations, there's no increase in current or future economic ""wealth"" at all. In that case, all that's happened is the future long-term returns on ABC stock have declined. Yes, having bought low and sold high, Alice is particularly better off, but only because her transactions have allowed her to obtain a transfer of wealth from other people in the economy. While the market capitalization of ABC is higher, how does a holder get at it? All of the shares have to be held by someone until they're retired. Alice and Deena can certainly sell the stock they own for a higher price than before, but only by obtaining a transfer of funds from some new buyer. The true ""wealth"" embodied in ABC stock is still the stream of future value-added production and the resulting deliverable cash flows that ABC will distribute to its shareholders over time. Starting to get a feel for this? Securities are not ""net"" wealth for the economy as a whole. They are evidence that funds have been intermediated from one person in the economy to another. Each one is an asset to some holder and a liability to some issuer. From an individual perspective, every person who owns a financial security may count that asset as personal ""wealth,"" but it's really a claim on future cash flows that will be delivered by the issuer. Aside from whatever cash flows the security delivers while one owns it, the only way to realize the ""wealth"" at any point before the security is retired is to sell it to someone else. Telescope that into the future and you'll discover that the ""wealth"" embodied by any security is simply the stream of cash flows that it will deliver to its holders between today and the point that the security is retired. If new value-added output and income are not produced along the way, those cash flows are just transfers of existing funds from the issuer to the holder. Ultimately, the only thing that creates new net wealth for the economy as a whole is the value-added output that is produced but not consumed. Everything else is price fluctuation and wealth transfer between individuals. Suppose Elwood builds a bench from a tree in his backyard. Assume it's durable enough to be considered housing ""investment"" rather than consumption. If Fiona wants to purchase it but doesn't have the assets, Fiona can give an IOU to Elwood. One person in the economy has produced something, someone else has purchased it, and in the absence of other funds to transfer, a new debt security has been created to memorialize the exchange. If you net out all the new things in the economy, you've got the bench - the saved value-added output. Yes, there's a new debt security, but it's not aggregate wealth. It's simultaneously an asset to Elwood and a liability to Fiona, and it nets to zero. The security just tells you which direction future cash flows have to go between two people in the economy in order to retire that security.  When one nets out all the assets and liabilities in the economy, the only thing left - the true basis of a society's net worth - is the stock of real investment that it has accumulated as a result of prior saving, and its unused endowment of resources. Everything else cancels out because every security represents an asset of the holder and a liability of the issuer. Conceptualizing 'saved or unconsumed resources' as broadly as possible, the wealth of a nation consists of its stock of real private investment (e.g. housing, capital goods factories), real public investment (e.g. infrastructure), intangible intellectual capital (e.g. education, inventions, organizational knowledge and systems), and its endowment of basic resources such as land, energy, and water. In an open economy, one would include the net claims on foreigners (negative, in the U.S. case). Understand that securities are not economic wealth. They are a claim of one party in the economy - by virtue of past saving - on the future output produced by others. - John P. Hussman, Ph.D. (2015)  The ""money"" created by banks is not net wealth It's often said that banks ""print money out of thin air."" This is also incoherent. Banks simply intermediate funds, creating various objects (mainly ""loans"" and ""deposits"") in the process. These objects memorialize the exchange of funds, but each of these objects is someone's asset and someone's liability, and in aggregate, they all net out to zero. There's a very strong tendency among investors to count every bank deposit as if it represents ""money waiting to be spent"" and ""cash that has to go somewhere."" That's not how this works. The moment the Federal Reserve buys a Treasury security from someone, you know that there will be additional base money (currency and reserves) in the economy. But the base money is going to stick around until the Fed removes it. Somebody's got to hold it. Economic policies change economic outcomes only if they ease a constraint that was previously binding, or impose a constraint that wasn't there before. If we've learned anything over the past decade, it's that neither spending nor bank loans are stimulated by new base money once the economy is already drowning in it. Everything you ever learned about ""money multipliers"" quietly assumes that desirable opportunities are endlessly available; that the quantity of lendable reserves is the only constraint. As a former economics and finance professor, I'm almost embarrassed that our profession teaches such nonsense to students. The only thing that has been reliably stimulated by quantitative easing (and even then, only in periods where investors have been inclined to speculate), is a yield-seeking game of hot-potato that has driven market valuations to extremes that now imply negative returns in the S&amp;P 500 for more than a decade. Charlie deposits $100 into his bank account. Charlie's bank now holds base money, which ""backs"" Charlie's deposit. If Charlie's bank lends the base money to Deena, the bank now has an IOU as an asset which now ""backs"" Charlie's deposit, and Deena has an IOU as a liability. Meanwhile, $100 of base money travels to Deena's bank. Deena has a bank deposit that she counts as an asset. The bank deposit is a liability to Deena's bank, and Deena's bank counts the $100 in base money as an asset. There's no more base money than there was before. There are, of course, more deposits in the banking system that are counted as ""M1,"" but beyond $100 of base money that has gone from bank to bank, every bit of so-called ""money"" creation here is simply a set of offsetting assets and liabilities that net to zero. Emphatically, the M1 ""created"" by the banking system is not aggregate ""wealth."" No money has been ""pumped into the economy."" Nothing has been ""created out of thin air."" Existing funds have been intermediated. That's it. Indeed, the only way for any of the lending to actually contribute to new ""wealth"" is for someone to engage in real economic activity that draws new value-added output into existence. If you look at total deposits in the U.S. banking system, you've got some deposits that are ""backed"" by base money, and others that are backed by ""loans"" (assets to the bank, liabilities to the borrowers). There's not an exact relationship between deposits, loans, and base money, because banks can use their assets for investments other than loans, and can fund those investments with other sources than deposits. Still, since bank deposits are primarily backed either by loans or by base money, we find that bank deposits move roughly in line with base money + loans. The moment the Fed buys Treasury securities and pays for them by creating base money, you've got a pretty good indication that bank deposits are going to increase relative to bank loans. But that doesn't drive people to alter their savings plans or to run out and spend those deposits. People don't spend their savings simply because they are holding their savings in a different form. People spend because it serves a need or advances a goal. Quantitative easing doesn't change that.  Here's the thing. Despite over a decade of deranged Federal Reserve policy - I use that word intentionally to mean both ""wildly outside of the historical range"" and ""bat$%!# crazy"" - bank loan growth has been utterly unremarkable. So the growth we've seen in bank deposits primarily reflects the fact that the Fed has replaced trillions of dollars of Treasury bills with base money. That's really the crowning accomplishment of QE - creating a massive pool of zero-interest hot potatoes that someone has to hold at every moment in time, and that does virtually nothing but destabilize the financial system with yield-seeking speculation. The chart below shows 5-year commercial bank loan growth.  Commentators on financial television may gurgle about all the ""cash on the sidelines"" and speculate why it needs to ""flow somewhere,"" but these phrases are incoherent. It's not there because lending has increased, or because ""wealth"" has increased, or because it's ""waiting to be spent."" It's there precisely because the Fed replaced Treasury securities with base money that somebody has to hold at every moment in time. It doesn't need to ""flow"" anywhere. It's already there. Banks are welcome to make more loans, but they do so only if there are creditworthy uses for the funds that the banks are willing to approve. Even then, every loan is both an asset and a liability. You can call these loans ""money creation"" if you like, but they are not new ""savings"" and they are not new ""wealth."" Individual depositors can try to get rid of their base money by purchasing stocks (provided that they are inclined to speculate), but the base money just goes to the seller. That's how we find ourselves amid the most extreme financial bubble in U.S. history. Yet even changes in stock prices aren't changes in aggregate wealth. The wealth is in the future cash flows and the value-added production that generates them. Whatever people choose to do with their deposits, the bottom line is the same. None of this ""cash on the sidelines"" is going to go away until the Fed removes it. The growth in bank deposits over the past decade has been a nearly mechanical response to the growth in base money that somebody has to hold, at every moment of time. Meanwhile, by encouraging years of yield-seeking speculation, the Fed has done enormous damage, in my view, to the long-term stability of the financial markets. We've adapted our discipline in a way that can navigate their speculative effects without embracing their premises, but I continue to have little doubt that it will all end in tears. Policymakers sometimes flatter themselves with the idea that holding interest rates at untenably low levels makes it cheaper for borrowers to obtain funds. Unfortunately, it does so only by transferring income from people who are trying to save for the future. Replacing Treasury securities with base money may make savings more ""liquid,"" but it doesn't suddenly make people abandon their retirement plans in favor of consuming today. Low rates also don't magically create productive investment opportunities. What economic activities suddenly become viable at zero interest rates that were somehow not viable before? Only projects so unproductive that any positive hurdle rate would sink them. The main activities that are encouraged by zero interest rates are activities where interest is the primary cost of doing business: leveraged real estate transactions; ""carry trades"" that employ enormous amounts of leverage to profit from small yield differences; and speculation on margin. Presently, margin debt as a percentage of GDP is at a historic extreme.  Again, neither loan creation, nor the issuance of securities, nor price appreciation of existing securities is sufficient to create net wealth in the economy. For that, someone needs to engage in real economic activities that draw new goods and services into existence, and have a higher value to others than the inputs that were used to produce them. If someone's spending exceeds their receipts, someone's receipts will exceed their spending Theories about money provide even more fertile ground for the emergence of incoherent ideas. These range from the idea that government deficits create ""savings"" (a popular idea among the MMT crowd), to the idea that there is a reliable ""tradeoff"" between unemployment and inflation. Let's begin with some very basic accounting. National output is comprised of the number of goods and services that are consumed, plus the amount of output that is saved as ""real investment"" (tangible things like capital goods, factories, computers, and inventories), plus the amount consumed as government spending, plus the net amount goods and services that are exported. We can define GDP in terms of income or in terms of output, but the two definitions are essentially the same (aside from small statistical discrepancies). From an output standpoint, investment is just output that is not consumed (even if it represents unwanted ""inventory investment""). So it's a rather obvious accounting identity that ""savings"" must equal ""investment."" Moreover, the value of savings from an income standpoint is also equal to the value of real investment from an output standpoint. The only thing that can make this seem complicated is that the people who ""save"" are typically not the same people as the ones who own the ""real investment."" That's because savings get intermediated in the financial markets. Still, in aggregate, savings always an equal investment. That's not a theory. It's an accounting identity. The moment the government runs a shortfall, where its consumption and net investment exceed its revenue, you know with absolute certainty that some other sector must run a surplus, where its income exceeds its consumption and net investment. Again, that's not a theory. It's an accounting identity. Recently, you've probably seen lots of headlines about ""soaring"" household savings, corporate profits and trade deficits, coupled with all sorts of behavioral reasons to explain it all. What may be less obvious is that these surpluses are the predictable, mechanical, mirror-images of recent government deficits. When you see an economy where the government has run a massive shortfall over the past year, you will also see an economy where the income of other sectors, in excess of their consumption and net investment, has enjoyed a massive surplus. The chart below shows what this looks like. The negative line is just the shortfall of government revenue in funding its spending and net investment. The upper line is the aggregate surplus of households, corporations, and foreign countries. I've left out a few minor accounting items like net interest for simplicity, but you get the picture. The two lines are mirror images of each other. They have to be.  Moreover, we know precisely how the additional surpluses have been invested, in aggregate. To see this, ask yourself the question - how does the government spend more than it receives in revenue? It issues Treasury securities. If the Federal Reserve buys the Treasury securities, they are replaced with base money. Who has to hold all the new Treasury securities and base money? Other sectors: households, corporations, or foreign countries. How much do they have to hold? The answer is obvious: the same amount that the government has issued to finance its shortfall. With that, the following outcome is axiomatic: Anytime the government runs a shortfall, where its consumption and net investment exceeds its revenue, other sectors must run a precisely offsetting surplus, where their income will exceed their consumption and net investment. Moreover, that surplus must be held by those other sectors (households, corporations, and foreign countries) in the form of securities, and indeed, those additional holdings must comprise the identical securities that the government has issued in order to finance its shortfall. Let this all sink in. There is no such thing as ""cash on the sidelines"" because there are no sidelines. Once ""cash"" is created, someone must hold it, in the form of cash, at every moment until the cash is retired. Government shortfalls don't ""create"" savings. They do create ""surpluses"" in the sense that someone in the economy away trades some of their output in return for government securities, but this is simply a transfer of current consumption in return for securities that can be traded for consumption at another time. None of this, in itself, represents the creation of wealth. Wealth creation occurs always and only through value-added production; drawing goods and services into existence that are more valuable to others than the inputs used to produce them. If you want an economy that creates wealth, you need an economy that directs its resources toward productive real investment and value-added production. Equilibrium gives you no other choice. The idea that monetary and fiscal policy can be ""independent"" is incoherent The government has a budget constraint. That doesn't mean that it can't run deficits. It just means that those deficits have to be financed. Specifically, the fiscal shortfall of the government is financed by issuing government liabilities. First, new liabilities are issued by the Treasury in the form of interest-bearing Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve can then buy some of that Treasury debt and pay for it by replacing the debt with its own liabilities, which are called ""base money"" (currency and bank reserves). See the top of your dollar bill for details. Unless the new base money is retired later, its creation represents a form of government finance - what economists call ""seigniorage."" As Nobel economist Thomas Sargent (my other dissertation advisor at Stanford) has observed, monetary policy and fiscal policy are bound by arithmetic - ""a government budget doesn't sharply separate monetary from fiscal policy."" If you read the Federal Reserve Act, you'll find that it was written to very tightly restrict the ability of the Federal Reserve to engage in any form of money creation except by purchasing:  liabilities of the U.S. government ""fully guaranteed as to principal and interest""; gold and certain foreign government debt; commercial, agricultural, and industrial bills of exchange - essentially short-term payables secured by tangible collateral - maturing in less than 90 days, which is actually what ""discounting"" refers to in the Act. Notably, the Act prohibits the discounting of bills backed by ""merely securities"" or ""other investment securities, except bonds and notes of the government of the United States; discounts to individuals, partnerships, and corporations, ""in unusual and exigent circumstances,"" as part of a program with broad-based eligibility, specifically designed ""for the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system, and not to aid a failing financial company, and that the security for emergency loans is sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses.""  Why all the rules, man? Because - and understand this clearly - if the Federal Reserve buys any security that goes belly up, and that security is not a liability of the U.S. government, the Fed will effectively have printed money to directly enrich the investors in the security that went belly up - not to provide seigniorage to the government. Purchasing any security without collateral sufficient to prevent losses would amount to engaging in fiscal policy without the authorization of Congress, and it would be illegal, not to mention unconstitutional. That's why the only context in which the Fed was actually authorized to buy corporate debt last year was by using a portion of CARES funds specifically approved by Congress and allocated by the Treasury. It's why creating a shell ""special purpose vehicle"" to hold the debt, counting corporate debt as its own ""collateral,"" and valuing it at acquisition cost rather than market value, was all sharply inconsistent with the Federal Reserve Act. See for example Section 13(2) and Section 13(8), which are crystal clear that securities should not be treated as collateral unless they are guaranteed by the U.S. government. It's why purchasing corporate debt below investment grade violated both 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and Section 4003(c)(3)(b) of the CARES Act, which imposed the requirement that collateral must be sufficient to avoid public losses. It's also why ""leveraging"" CARES funds between 3x and 10x, as was first proposed, was so wildly illegal that Congress got involved to prevent it. Mr. Chairman, if you could get back to me and just show me where the Fed has the authority to purchase these below investment-grade instruments, I'd appreciate it.- U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen [MD] to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, May 19, 2020 While investors believe that Fed purchases of corporate securities somehow ""saved the economy,"" the fact is that corporate bond purchases by the Fed last year amounted to less than $14 billion, in an economy that has over $11 trillion in corporate debt. I consider this a good outcome, given the questionable legality of the whole operation, coupled with the fact that the Fed is poorly equipped even to make collateralized business loans. The more important point is that except when the funds to do so are explicitly allocated by Congress, the Fed cannot, and should never purchase uncollateralized corporate securities, or assets of a shell entity in which uncollateralized securities are counted as ""collateral."" Any loss would amount to money printing for the benefit of private investors, rather than seigniorage for the benefit of the public. On the nature of money Given the increased attention of investors to money, inflation, deficits, Bitcoin, market valuations, and quantitative easing, it may be useful to discuss how all of these tie together - how we can think about them in a coherent way. In the sections below, I've included a few charts from recent comments in order to illustrate these links. Treasury securities and base money are both government liabilities, and they act as substitutes. It doesn't matter that the money will never be retired. Neither, most likely, will the bonds be repaid. They'll just be refinanced. The difference is that Treasury securities are interest-bearing, so they represent a larger liability in the long term. It's true that Treasury debt can be inflated away in real terms, but only if the maturity is long enough so that the interest rate can't be adjusted higher with inflation. Both Treasury securities and base money memorialize the fact that the government has spent more than its receipts. Someone in the economy has given up real goods and services in return for one of these liabilities because they have confidence that they'll be able to exchange them with someone else for future goods and services. The government can certainly destroy that confidence by engaging in too much deficit finance, and the public can certainly change the relative value they place on these liabilities. For example, if the public becomes willing to exchange fewer goods and services for a unit of base money, we call it inflation. If the public becomes willing to exchange less base money for one Treasury security, we say that nominal interest rates went up. Why is anyone willing to hold base money at all? In my view, base money is essentially a government-produced commodity - a kind of ""product"" - that provides a stream of tiny transaction services to each successive holder, both as a means of payment and a store of value, provided that each holder is confident that the next person will accept it. Like any other security, the value of a unit of money can be conceptualized as the present value of the stream of all those little future transaction services. Base money has value to the public because it is involved in billions of transactions every year, its acceptance is required by fiat, embraced by convention, and it serves as the substrate for the entire banking system. By comparison, one of the problems I have with Bitcoin is that the bandwidth of the system - about 2000 transactions every 10 minutes - is strikingly narrow, yet with extraordinarily high energy costs and coinbase dilution per transaction. There's also the fact that a monetary system based on Bitcoin would deprive the government of hundreds of billions in seigniorage, shifting the funds that would otherwise be available to the public resources to private ""miners"" instead. Forget that there's neither fiat that compels others to accept it, nor any reserve requirement that requires the banking system to use it. In my view the most likely cryptographic substrate of the banking system will be generated by central banks - basically just glorified base money - while independent cryptocurrencies will continue to be used primarily as a substrate for speculation and black market transactions. It seems to me that if the perfect currency dropped from heaven and everybody agreed to use it, a big characteristic would be nobody starts off being billionaires.- @Batbeat2 The belief that quantitative easing mechanically ""supports"" the market is incoherent Base money and Treasury securities directly compete as forms of ""short term liquidity."" If the Fed creates more zero-interest money than people want to hold, individual holders try to chase other securities that offer a pickup in yield. Of course, all of the base money still has to be held by someone, so it doesn't go ""into"" those other securities. Rather, increasing the quantity of zero-interest hot potatoes causes investors to drive up the prices of closely competing securities, to the point where the ""marginal"" holder of money is indifferent between holding zero-interest money and low-interest Treasury debt. Here's what his looks like. It's my version of what economists call the ""liquidity preference curve.""  Of course, the discomfort of investors who must, in the aggregate, hold this mountain of zero-interest hot potatoes also encourages investors to chase riskier assets. The problem is that those assets have risk, and the moment that investors become inclined toward risk-aversion, a safe return of zero is quite preferable to a potentially severe loss. So as I've detailed extensively in other comments, we find that Federal Reserve easing does little or nothing to support an overvalued market once we observe deterioration and divergence (risk-aversion) in our measures of market internals, rather than broad uniformity (speculative pressure). The chart below shows the cumulative total return of the S&amp;P 500, partitioned by various combinations of monetary policy and market internals (our main gauge of speculative vs. risk-averse psychology).  Put simply, it's not quantitative easing that holds the market up. It's the belief that quantitative easing holds the market up that holds the market up. The problem is that the whole operation relies on the absence of risk-aversion among investors. In my view, it's best to attend to the uniformity or divergence of market internals directly. The belief that monetary policy determines inflation is strikingly incomplete There are two key reasons you'll find a very weak relationship between the money supply and the rate of inflation (and you will). The first is that monetary policy doesn't actually determine the quantity of government liabilities that the public must hold, nor does it determine the confidence of the public in those liabilities. Fiscal policy does that. Monetary policy simply changes the mix of government liabilities - how much the public must hold as Treasury bonds, and how much the public must hold as base money. The key is that both liabilities share the same basis for public confidence - the implicit expectation that the issuance of government liabilities won't exceed the growth of the real economy so profoundly and consistently that others will become unwilling to accept these pieces of paper in return for a (reasonably) stable quantity of goods and services. The second and related reason you'll find a weak relationship between the money supply and the rate of inflation is that inflation has an enormous psychological component. The public appears to be quite tolerant of short-term fluctuations in the relative supply of government liabilities (bonds and base money) versus goods and services, but if new issuance of government liabilities becomes large enough to trigger psychological ""revulsion"" toward that new supply - particularly if the economy faces constraints in producing new goods and services - inflation typically follows. If inflation is running out of control, monetary policy doesn't stop it simply by reducing the growth rate of money. It's certainly true that rising interest rates can aggravate recessions and disrupt financial markets, so tight money can be enough to disrupt ordinary cyclical inflation pressure. But if you examine periods of aggressive and sustained inflation both in the U.S. and across countries, you'll find that tight monetary policy stops inflation mainly by imposing a tighter and more credible constraint on fiscal policy - by removing the printing press as a form of government finance and thereby increasing the confidence of the public in government liabilities generally. In each case that we have studied, once it became widely understood that the government would not rely on the central bank for its finances, the inflation terminated and the exchanges stabilized. We have further seen that it was not simply the increasing quantity of central bank notes that caused the hyperinflation. Rather, it was the growth of fiat currency which was unbacked, or backed only by government bills, which there never was a prospect to retire through taxation.- Nobel economist Thomas J. Sargent From an economic standpoint, we can think of the general price level in terms of two ""marginal utilities"" (the extra happiness you get from having one extra unit of something). If you get 10 units of happiness from an ice cream cone, but only 2 units from a pencil, then the price of one ice cream cone (pencils/cone) should be five pencils. In theory, the price level is the ""marginal utility"" of one unit of goods and services divided by the marginal utility of one unit of money. Price level = Marginal utility of goods and services / Marginal utility of money So what drives inflation? Well, the ""marginal utility"" of goods increases either when the desirability of goods and services increases, or when the supply of goods and services is constrained. The ""marginal utility"" of money and government liabilities falls either when their desirability to the public falls, or when their supply is expanded. Half of those considerations depend on relative supply, and half is wholly psychological. Historically, and across countries, the best recipe for inflation has been an expansion in government deficits coupled with either output constraints or a supply shock. The chart below shows the GDP output gap (real GDP relative to ""potential"" GDP as estimated by the CBO) alongside the U.S. government deficit as a share of GDP. It's clear that deficits fluctuate with the economic cycle, and this alone doesn't disrupt confidence in government liabilities. In contrast, we tend to see inflationary pressure when deficits become what I call ""cyclically excessive"" relative to the output gap, and output is running close to potential (or supply constraints become problematic as they have in recent months).  What drives deflation then? Push marginal utilities in the other direction. The marginal utility of goods and services can decline if people become less inclined toward current consumption, or if goods and services are in ample supply. In a rapidly growing economy, you'll find that stronger output growth is actually associated with lower inflation because the expanding supply of goods places downward pressure on the marginal utility of goods. In a credit crisis, safe liquidity can become a desirable asset - its marginal value increases, and you get deflationary pressures. Constraining the supply of government liabilities can also raise their marginal utility. You can't reliably model these things in some linear way. Just like stock prices, part of the value is based on ""fundamentals,"" and part is based on psychology. Your best bet is to monitor both and to pay particular attention when financial assets associated with inflation expectations begin to perk up uniformly. It's an unfortunate reality, but the best predictor of future inflation is actually current inflation. Presently, we've got enormous government deficits, coupled with economic and labor market frictions as the economy gradually reopens. That alone has created clear short-term inflation pressures. The question is the extent to which deficits will continue, for what purposes, or how durably various supply frictions will persist. All of these matter for the future course of inflation. It will be important to monitor inflation-sensitive market gauges for signs of revulsion and deteriorating confidence. I would be particularly concerned about deficits that are not clearly related to expansion in productive capacity (such as infrastructure, research &amp; development, or clean energy). Productive forms of deficit spending, like any sort of productive spending, can certainly justify the use of debt, because the debt can be repaid from future value-added production. Still, the size of recent deficits is of clear concern, as is the Federal Reserve's encouragement of deficits by monetizing them. Even if large deficits don't result in current inflation, it's important to notice that once government liabilities are created, they stick around until they're retired. It's quite possible that we could create an enormous volume of government liabilities in a weak economy without immediate inflation, yet discover later that the overhang of these liabilities (both Treasury debt and base money) could contribute to high inflation later because their quantity has become disproportionate to the volume of real goods and services produced by the economy. The popular interpretation of the Phillips Curve is a misconception As a former academic economist, I've often noted that academic economists don't actually study the economy. They study ""economies"" - as in - ""Consider an economy where there are two islands, a turnpike, and five guys named Bob, one who is the government but nobody knows which one."" As a graduate student at Stanford, I once attended a seminar where a young Paul Krugman described a model as he casually drew a few arrows on the blackboard. A faculty member demanded that he either explicitly describe the dynamics or erase the arrows. The interchange escalated with breathtaking speed, ending with the faculty member pounding the desk, screaming ""ERASE THE ARROWS!"" and then storming out, slamming the door behind him. Amid the multiple personality disorder of policy-makers that oscillates between simplistic but weak-fitting ""Phillips Curve"" dogma and wildly elaborate but weak-fitting ""dynamic stochastic general equilibrium"" models, the durable constant is that policy-makers don't focus much of their thinking on the actual economy either. Instead, they think in terms of theoretical ""objects"" that take on lives of their own and offer ""policy levers"" based on hypothetical relationships rather than data. This avoids any need for evidence that the policies actually have reliable and sizeable effects, much less historical context. Think that's an exaggeration? Here's the Phillips Curve you might have seen in your college textbook, and the same one that's in the heads of policymakers at the Federal Reserve. It's very pretty, and it immediately seduces the observer to imagine the ample social benefits that could be engineered if we could just ""achieve"" a higher rate of inflation.  Unfortunately, the data are not so kind. Here's the actual scatterplot. First, unemployment versus trailing 12-month inflation.  Next, unemployment versus subsequent 12-month inflation.  Finally, for good measure for those who imagine that lower unemployment can be ""bought"" with higher inflation, here is a scatter of trailing 12-month inflation versus the unemployment rate one year later.  Try as one might salvage this theory with ""expectations augmented"" features, leads, lags, advanced econometrics, and theoretical modifications, you'll have a difficult time finding any useful relationship at all between the rate of unemployment and the rate of general price inflation (e.g. the consumer price index). You can torture the data enough to give you a significant p-value or F-test, but it's much harder to demonstrate that extraordinary monetary policy has an effect size that's worth the financial distortions. It's just impossible to salvage much when an economic relationship that policymakers treat as a tidy curve is actually a disorganized shotgun scatter that slopes in the wrong direction. Part of the problem is, or should be, immediately apparent to anyone who has just enough intellectual curiosity required to simply read the title - just the title! - of A.W. Phillips' famous 1958 paper: The Relation Between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957. See, here's the thing. The Phillips Curve was actually a statement about wage inflation, not general price inflation. Moreover, Phillips studied a period when the U.K. was generally on the gold standard, so general price inflation was very stable. In fact, Phillips makes an explicit point of ""ignoring years in which import prices rise rapidly enough to initiate a wage-price spiral."" So the wage inflation Phillips was observing was actually real wage inflation; inflation in wages relative to the prices of other things. Put simply, the Phillips Curve that policymakers imagine in their heads is incoherent. It doesn't actually exist. The actual relationship that Phillips found was a rather straightforward relationship between the scarcity of labor and the price of labor (relative to other things). When unemployment is high and labor is plentiful, real wage inflation tends to be muted. When unemployment is low and labor is scarce (particularly in situations like today where there are labor market frictions as the economy recovers from the pandemic), real wage inflation tends to accelerate. The mapping between observable valuations and expected returns is independent of the level of interest rates Suppose I hand you an IOU that will deliver, with certainty, $100 a decade from today. The current price is $32. Given this information, it's simple to calculate that your expected annual return is: ($100/$32)^(1/10)-1 = 12%. Did you need to check the level of interest rates to do that calculation? No, you did not. You can certainly compare that expected return with the prevailing level of interest rates, but that's optional. Now suppose I tell you that the price of the IOU is $82. Again, it's simple to calculate that your expected annual return is: ($100/$82)^(1/10)-1 = 2%. It's essential to understand this point: the mapping from observable valuations to expected returns does not need to be ""adjusted"" for the level of interest rates. You're free to compare the expected return with interest rates if you like, but once you have an estimate (or sufficient statistic) of future cash flows and the current price, nothing else is required to estimate the expected return. The reason so many investors and even professionals are confused on this point is that they have conflated it with an entirely different problem. Suppose that we know the expected cash flows but the current price is unobservable or excluded from our calculations. What's the ""fair"" price we should pay for the security? Well, it depends on the rate of return we want to earn. At this point, we might look around and say, we'll interest rates are so-and-so, and I'd like to get a few percent more than that, so maybe I'd be ok with a 4% return. Fine. Now we can plug that in, and we get a target price of: $100/(1.04)^10 = $67.56. So here's the rule. If you've got a reliable valuation measure that relates the current price to some fundamental that's reasonably representative of future cash flows, the expected return can be estimated directly. Comparing that expected return to interest rates comes later, and is optional. In contrast, if you've got an estimate of future cash flows and you don't know the price, you can use the level of interest rates, if you wish, to help you decide what a ""fair"" return might be, and the price that would produce that expected return. Don't confuse those two problems. When analysts say that extreme valuations are ""justified relative to interest rates,"" they are actually saying that dismal expected returns on stocks are ""justified"" by dismal returns on bonds. Nothing more. If it makes you feel better, you can certainly repeat the phrase in the mirror as your morning affirmation, but it won't make your future passive returns on stocks any less dismal. Put simply, extreme valuations imply poor expected returns, and those returns aren't mitigated by low-interest rates. Rather, the combination of poor expected returns on both stocks and bonds leaves passive investors absolutely worse off, because it deprives them of alternatives. I know many of you don't believe that, so let's look at the data in three dimensions. The chart shows valuations on log scale, along with the level of long-term Treasury bond yields, and the actual subsequent 12-year total return of the S&amp;P 500. The current point can't be plotted, because we don't know the actual subsequent 12-year total return yet, but the two observable variables - valuations and interest rates - would put us in the extreme lower corner of this plot.  Now, looking at the chart, it might seem that low-interest rates are reliably associated with extreme valuations, but that's actually not true at all. Rather, valuations drive the expected returns so strongly that the interest rate information adds virtually no information at all. The points just lie behind the principal scatter at varying distances. To see this, I've also provided a view of the same scatter from the top-down.  Notice something. When interest rates have been extremely high (above 10% or so), valuations have been reliably low. But at rates below 10%, there is no reliable relationship between interest rates and valuations. Here's a fascinating result (h/t Jeff Huber for proposing the question): When we examine the relationship between valuations alone and subsequent returns, we find a correlation of 0.9170 in data since 1928. If we add the level of interest rates as an additional explanatory variable, we get no improvement in that correlation. What surprised even me is that if we add a third variable - the change in interest rates over the coming 12-years (which assumes that we know future interest rates with certainty) - the correlation rises to only 0.9174. Put simply, once you know the level of valuations, at least for reliable valuation measures, knowing the current level of interest rates - and even knowing the future level of interest rates - does not improve your projection of future returns. Once you've estimated the future cash flows, and you know the current price, you can estimate expected long-term returns directly. The level of interest rates is irrelevant to that arithmetic. You can compare your estimate of long-term returns with the level interest rates afterward, if you like, but interest rates are not required for the calculation. That's clearly true in theory, as I noted at the beginning of this section, but I was still surprised by the degree that it was true in the historical data, even at a 12-year horizon. One can certainly imagine factors that might weaken this result, particularly at short horizons, but even then, nearly 100 years of historical data suggest that attending to the combination of valuations and market internals is an adequate basis to navigate market cycles over time. As I've noted before, the only thing that was truly ""different"" about recent years is that we had to abandon our response to historical ""limits"" to speculation. Instead, we've become content to gauge the presence or absence of speculation or risk-aversion, without assuming any well-defined limit to either. There's one way to formulate the valuation problem that does require one to consider the level of interest rates. That consideration comes in when you're trying to estimate the likely difference in expected returns between stocks and bonds. As I've noted before, I am not a fan of ""equity risk premium"" models that divide the earnings yield of stocks by the interest rate or subtract the level of interest rates from some measure of stock yields. Both of those operations assume a very structural, one-to-one relationship between the valuation of stocks (which are very long-duration instruments) and the valuation of bonds (which have far shorter durations except when equity valuations are profoundly depressed). Instead, our own equity risk premium estimate is straightforward: use valuations to estimate expected equity returns for a given investment horizon, and then compare that estimate with the yield-to-maturity of bonds for that same investment horizon. I've seen no alternative method of estimating the equity risk premium (including Shiller's ""excess CAPE yield"") that is better correlated with the actual difference between stock and bond returns across history. Still, as we observed for the 12-year period following 1988, actual returns can be far better than one would have projected if the end of the period happens to be the peak of a bubble. The dismal forward-looking returns here are the mirror image of glorious backward-looking returns. The same outcome followed the 1929 and 2000 valuation extremes.  By the way, take a moment to notice how widely the difference in returns between stocks and bonds has varied across history. If low-interest rates were always associated with steep valuations, and high-interest rates were always associated with depressed valuations, you would not observe many variations in this chart. The fact that the expected and actual ""premium"" fluctuates all over the place means that there are distinct periods where either stock, or sometimes bonds, are vastly preferable to the other. In some cases, cash can also provide ""option value,"" at least until a retreat in valuations or an improvement in market action provides an opportunity to embrace greater market risk. Rather than cash positions, I prefer hedged equity in these situations. Two years ago, I published a white paper titled Strategic Allocation, describing how we can use this information in a disciplined way. Competitive free enterprise without the erosion of excess profits is not competitive free enterprise If we examine the history of economic growth, it is clear that the long-term expansion in the standard of living does not simply reflect the continuous increase in the production of some single ""representative good,"" but instead by the progressive introduction of new inventions, technologies, and products that satisfy previous unmet needs. In his work on economic development, Joseph Schumpeter recognized the critical role of entrepreneurs in advancing this process. When Schumpeter described ""creative destruction,"" and Adam Smith described the ""invisible hand,"" they envisioned an economic system where the potential for profit would serve as an incentive for innovation by those who were best capable of filling unmet needs. But they also saw profits as inherently self-destructive, because profit opportunities would encourage a ""swarm-like"" activity of other entrepreneurs. That competition would expand production and simultaneously produce economic growth while eroding excessive profits.  As the rise and decay of industrial fortunes is the essential fact about the social structure of capitalist society, both the emergence of what is, in any single instance, an essentially temporary gain, and the elimination of it through the working of the competitive mechanism, obviously are more than 'frictional' phenomena, as is the process of underselling by which industrial progress comes about in a capitalist society and by which its achievements result in higher incomes all around. - Joseph Schumpeter, The Instability of Capitalism (1928)  It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. He generally neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. He intends only his own gain, and he is, in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations  One of the concerning aspects of current economic debates is the tendency to embrace ""capitalism"" indiscriminately, without actually considering the aspects of this system that contribute to the growth and widespread prosperity. To parrot Churchill's statement that ""capitalism is the worst economic system, aside from all the others"" is incoherent. Well, partly because he never said it. What he did say was ""Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried,"" and he attributed it to someone else. But the statement about capitalism is also incoherent if one becomes willing to dispense with the very features of capitalism that drive growth and lift all boats. Personally, I prefer the phrase ""competitive free enterprise"" to ""capitalism"" because it clarifies things - particularly the essential role of entrepreneurship, and also the role that free entry and competition should have, but not always does, in eliminating excessive profits over time. A careful understanding of free enterprise must also consider ""externalities"" where the behavior of an individual or company imposes costs to others that they do not bear (e.g. pollution), or provides benefits to others that they do not fully capture (e.g. education, scientific research). There's little question, for example, that Amazon is extraordinarily efficient in meeting customer needs, but there is also little question that by channeling resources out of the local circular flow, the resilience of countless communities is subtly weakened. The costs are not borne by Amazon, nor is the damage per transaction high enough for any customer to change their behavior. Likewise, international trade can have features that amplify systemic inequity or impose uncompensated harm to others. All of these are ""externalities."" In these cases, a free market will produce too much of the activities that produce negative externalities, and insufficient amounts that produce positive externalities, unless policies are introduced to impose private costs for harmful activities or subsidize beneficial ones (e.g. carbon taxes, investment tax credits, applying sales or value-added taxes to out-of-community purchases and reinvesting them back into the community). Nobel economist Ronald Coase demonstrated policies that ""internalize"" these externalities can enable the competitive free enterprise to produce more efficient outcomes with no loss of overall welfare. A well-known difficulty emerges in the case of monopoly. In the traditional analysis of monopoly, excess profits are preserved by the ability of the monopolist to restrain output and thereby maintain prices at higher levels than would exist in a competitive economy. In the standard analysis, increasing levels of output are associated with a rising marginal cost for each additional unit, so the monopolist has an incentive to hold output at a sufficiently limited level to ensure a wide gap between marginal revenue and marginal cost. So monopolists are traditionally thought of as producers that charge high prices and limit supply. However, in any setting where the marginal cost of producing each additional unit declines with the level of output, simply obtaining more customers is sufficient to enhance profits. In this case, neither limited supply nor high prices are required, yet the company may enjoy the status of a ""natural monopoly."" The level of profits, in this case, may have little relationship to the contribution of the entrepreneur, but may instead reflect broader factors such as network effects, social dynamics, and general technological efficiencies that were no part of the entrepreneur's invention. Undoubtedly, the introduction of a new and useful product is deserving of compensation, possibly even extraordinary reward. Without it, the entrepreneurial incentive would be weakened. Yet when the act of invention is amplified by such powerful network effects that enormous natural monopolies result, much of the profit and enterprise value of these monopolies represent private claims to very general features of technology, network effects, social conventions - sometimes even physics and genetics - that might be better characterized as public goods. Suppose a new technology like quantum computing emerges, and it's now possible to create intelligent robot toasters that can do every possible thing that human labor can accomplish, from manufacturing to teaching, to art; better and more cheaply than any human counterpart. Even better, robot toasters can reproduce at nearly zero ""marginal cost,"" and become more effective every time the toasters interact with each other. Suppose that even though many people could create them, I happen to be first, and no other entrant can successfully compete once my toasters start interacting. In that world, I and my army of robot toasters may be able to ""efficiently"" produce all of the output in the economy, and gradually accumulate all of its resources. Others may be able to survive by going into debt or indenture. None of this monopolistic behavior could be considered to be competitive free enterprise. Weakening ""creative destruction"" In Schumpeter's framework, the emergence of significant innovations provokes the ""swarm-like"" entry of new entrepreneurs that operate alongside older enterprises. The resulting boom results disrupt the previous equilibrium and inevitably results in errors, speculation, and debt issuance by new and older businesses alike, which can later contribute to subsequent recessions - ""Part of the debt structure will crumble. Freezing of credits, shrinkage of deposits, and all the rest follow in due course."" As new competitors emerge to take advantage of what Schumpeter viewed as extraordinary but ""essentially temporary"" profits, output, and employment expand, profits fall back to normal levels. This continual cycle of ""creative destruction"" drives productivity growth, employment, and income across the economy, though not without periodic disruptions and crises. The economic cycles of recent decades have included many of these features, but the process has also been regularly short-circuited by monetary policies that treat all borrowing as productive borrowing, and all business failure as unacceptable failure. The combination has since contributed to an overly indebted corporate sector, a global financial crisis, and an extended period of labor market slack where wages were depressed and profits became entrenched, without their elimination ""through the working of the competitive mechanism."" Meanwhile, nearly every aspect of Federal Reserve policy has contributed to an enormously skewed wealth distribution, where corporate securities are valued at extreme multiples of their underlying cash flows. One of the problems with the current economic equilibrium is that some industries no longer reflect ""competitive free enterprise"" and appear much closer to ""natural monopoly."" When people hear the word ""monopoly,"" they typically think of the cartoon guy with a top hat on the Hasbro game, where the object of the game is to corner the market and soak the other players. But a ""natural monopoly"" can occur in any business where the ""marginal cost"" - the cost of producing one extra unit - declines as output increases. In that situation, adding another customer always increases your profits provided the new customers aren't costly to acquire. You don't have to soak them. You just have to acquire them. The key to riches in this game is to find some way to distribute your efforts over the largest possible number of individual ""units."" Show me a multi-billionaire, and I'll show you someone who is benefiting not just from their own ""invention"" but from distribution systems, network effects, and features that resemble a natural monopoly. There's nothing inherently nefarious about that. It's just that there's a point where treating it all as individual ""wealth"" and personal achievement strains reason, particularly when the tax system treats profits, carried interest, and financial gains as sacrosanct. A tax system that treats multi-billion-dollar equity holdings as absolutely untouchable because they're ""unrealized"" is a political choice, not an economic one.  A natural monopoly is how we've found ourselves in a world where a handful of individual companies account for a quarter of U.S. market capitalization. One might imagine that this is an investment opportunity if not for the fact that all of these companies are trading at wildly elevated multiples of those already inflated fundamentals. The chart below shows the median price revenue ratio of the largest and smallest 10% of S&amp;P 500 components by market capitalization. Compared with recent extremes, the pre-crash bubble peak in 2000 was a picnic.  Still, even as part of the economy is behaving as a wildly overvalued natural monopoly, non-financial profit margins are starting to normalize to a greater degree than investors may recognize (particularly when one excludes massive but temporary pandemic relief subsidies). Across the non-financial sector as a whole, real unit labor costs have begun to rebound in the past few years, which has started to pressure profit margins lower. Unfortunately, this is occurring at a point where weaker profit margins threaten to cause credit strains for the mountain of debt that was taken on in the interim.  One of the polarizing political debates here is the extent to which extraordinary profits should be taxed. Schumpeter argued that invention and entrepreneurial activity can be conceived as a means of production, and as such, that part of the value of new products should be imputed to it. In that sense, profits don't necessarily reflect any ""exploitation"" of labor but are instead compensation deserved by an important factor of production. Still, Schumpeter didn't distinguish between the portion of the entrepreneurial activity that involves actual invention, and the portion that reflects network effects, economies of scale, amplifiers, feedback loops, social convention, and similar factors that - in practice - account for the lion's share of profits for natural monopolies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, and numerous other companies. Undoubtedly, the act of invention deserves compensation, and this compensation can be significant when an invention has achieved near-monolithic success. But at some point - my personal impression circulates around a few billion dollars at best - the value attributable to the hard work and effort of the inventor stops, and the remainder captures network effects and scale economies that might be more accurately considered ""public goods"" than private innovations. For example, Facebook is successful largely because a computer program written by a small initial team began drawing in users (original product: a ""Hot-or-Not"" clone called FaceMash to rate pictures of Harvard students without their permission). Those early Facebook users drew in friends, who use it because other people they know use it, and the platform gradually became the ""black hole"" of social networks, pulling everyone in toward it. There's undoubtedly value that can be imputed to the platform itself, but a great deal of the value is attributable to network effects. Capital with a ""K"" is not capital with a ""c"" Another subtle feature of the current economic landscape is the subtle but very intentional blurring of the word ""capital."" In economic theory, the output is often described as being a function of labor L and capital K, where ""capital with a K"" means real, productive investment like equipment, factories, and can even be extended to inventions. Because accumulating productive capital K also increases the productivity of labor L, and the amount of output that labor can command, there's a good deal of economic literature that encourages low taxes if any, on capital K. Of course, in the United States, real productive investment can be depreciated and deducted over time, so it isn't taxed at all. The subtle blurring comes in when people talk about financial capital ""capital with a c"" as if it is the same thing as K. Financial capital with a c involves things like debt, equities, interest, and profits. Certainly, all of these are involved in financing capital with a K, but again, K isn't taxed at all. Beyond that, there's absolutely no reason that a dollar of income earned from trading stocks and bonds should be taxed any differently than a dollar of income earned as wages or salary. When people yammer on with phrases like ""We shouldn't penalize capital formation,"" they're really taking an argument about productive capital K and blurring it as if it also applies to purely financial capital c. Look, I'm all in favor of tax incentives and accelerated depreciation for productive ""capital with a K"" - equipment, factories, research &amp; development, clean infrastructure, and even forms of human capital like education - but the idea that profits, carried interest, and financial gains are somehow fundamentally different and more preferable than wage income is a disingenuous bifurcation of the word ""capital."" That's yet another reason I prefer the phrase ""competitive free enterprise"" to ""capitalism."" When people say the word ""capitalism,"" half the time they don't even know which kind of capital they're talking about. In a properly functioning competitive free-enterprise system, profits are incentives for innovation, market-entry, and growth. But they are also - and should be - the engines of their own creative destruction. When economic policies treat profits as sacrosanct and treat financial gains as somehow preferential to wage income, it's no wonder that the end result is low real structural growth coupled with breathtaking income disparities.  An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics. - Plutarch, 100 A.D.  I'll say this again. When you net out all the assets and liabilities in the economy, the only thing that remains is our stock of productive investments, inventions, education, organizational structures, and unconsumed natural resources. Those are the basis of our national wealth. Every security is both an asset and a liability, and in aggregate, they net to zero. Moreover, since every security must be held by someone until it is retired, the value of that security is ultimately determined by the long-term stream of cash flows that it delivers to the holder. Overvaluation doesn't create wealth. It simply enables a wealth transfer from others, and only then if a holder actually sells at the elevated price. We would be much stronger as a nation if were capable of focusing on what's real, what's productive, what's equitable, and what has the capacity to lift all boats. That can be one of the virtues of competitive free enterprise, but it's also something that we are quite capable of destroying if we forget how it all actually works. My 5/18/21 Op-Ed in the Financial Times: The myths behind the current stock market bubble A quick accounting note on ""shortfall"" versus ""deficit"": Consider two sectors, government (g) and private (p).The equation below says that the shortfall of government is equal to the ""surplus"" of the other sectors: Consumption_g + Investment_g - Revenue_g = Revenue_p - Consumption_p - Investment_p Rearranging, the equation below says that the total investment is equal to total saving: Investment_g + Investment_p = (Revenue_p - Consumption_p) + (Revenue_g - Consumption_g) As for how various items fit together, gross government spending equals government consumption and net investment, plus government transfer payments to individuals, plus subsidies (transfers to goods and services producing enterprises), plus interest payments. In describing the relationships of sectoral surpluses and shortfalls, I use the word ""shortfall"" instead of ""deficit"" because I've moved certain government expenditures such as transfer payments, subsidies, and interest into private income.

An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data, if any, quoted above. More current performance data through the most recent month-end is available at www.hussmanfunds.com. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Funds carefully before investing. For this and other information, please obtain a Prospectus and read it carefully. The Hussman Funds have the ability to vary their exposure to market fluctuations depending on overall market conditions, and they may not track movements in the overall stock and bond markets, particularly over the short-term. While the intent of this strategy is long-term capital appreciation, total return, and protection of capital, the investment return and principal value of each Fund may fluctuate or deviate from overall market returns to a greater degree than other funds that do not employ these strategies. For example, if a Fund has taken a defensive posture and the market advances, the return to investors will be lower than if the portfolio had not been defensive. Alternatively, if a Fund has taken an aggressive posture, a market decline will magnify the Fund's investment losses. The Distributor of the Hussman Funds is Ultimus Fund Distributors, LLC., 225 Pictoria Drive, Suite 450, Cincinnati, OH, 45246. The Hussman Strategic Growth Fund has the ability to hedge market risk by selling short major market indices in an amount up to, but not exceeding, the value of its stock holdings. However, the Fund may experience a loss even when the entire value of its stock portfolio is hedged if the returns of the stocks held by the Fund do not exceed the returns of the securities and financial instruments used to hedge, or if the exercise prices of the Fund's call and put options differ, so that the combined loss on these options during a market advance exceeds the gain on the underlying index. The Fund also has the ability to leverage the amount of stock it controls to as much as 1 1/2 times the value of net assets, by investing a limited percentage of assets in call options. The Hussman Strategic Allocation Fund invests primarily in common stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents (such as U.S. Treasury bills and shares of money market mutual funds, aligning its allocations to these asset classes based on prevailing valuations and estimated expected returns in these markets. The investment strategy adds emphasis on risk-management to adjust the Fund's exposure in market conditions that suggest risk-aversion or speculation among market participants. The Fund may use options and futures on stock indices and Treasury bonds to adjust its relative investment exposures to the stock and bond markets, or to reduce the exposure of the Fund's portfolio to the impact of general market fluctuations when market conditions are unfavorable in the view of the investment adviser. The Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund has the ability to hedge the interest rate risk of its portfolio in an amount up to, but not exceeding, the value of its fixed income holdings. The Fund also has the ability to increase the interest rate exposure of its portfolio through limited purchases of Treasury zero-coupon securities and STRIPS. The Fund may also invest up to 30% of assets in alternatives to the U.S. fixed income market, including foreign government bonds, utility stocks, convertible bonds, real-estate investment trusts, and precious metals shares. The Hussman Strategic International Fund invests primarily in equities of companies that derive a majority of their revenues or profits from, or have a majority of their assets in, a country or country other than the U.S., as well as shares of exchange traded funds (""ETFs"") and similar investment vehicles that invest primarily in the equity securities of such companies. The Fund has the ability to hedge market risk by selling short major market indices using swaps, index options and index futures in an amount up to, but not exceeding, the value of its stock holdings. These may include foreign stock indices, and indices of U.S. stocks such as the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. Foreign markets can be more volatile than U.S. markets, and may involve additional risks.

However, Mossi praised the Bitcoin Law and believes it will create opportunities for the Central American country and its people. Mainly, as a more efficient route to send and receive remittances. He added: The signal that I want to leave you today is that BCIE (CABEI) is accompanying El Salvador in this new and innovative policy of adopting the cryptocurrency called Bitcoin for legal use. The president of the financial institution revealed that they will work with El Salvador to form a technical team of experts. Thus, they will be able to tackle the main obstacles with the new law and adapt it to the country’s needs.

At the same time, they have requested assistance from their international partners with pro-Bitcoin policies. The Challenge of Adopting The Bitcoin Standard Mossi emphasized that they will try to study cases where BTC has been adopted. In this way, the institution and the country’s authorities will have the tools to prevent mistakes. However, There is no other country that has adopted Bitcoin as widely as El Salvador has. This is a challenge, because you have to take it head-on and find the best way to protect the user. One of the challenges of El Salvador’s new law, according to the president of CABEI, is the bad actors operating in the Bitcoin network.

Mossi considers cryptocurrencies to be a positive innovation. CABEI has been supportive of El Salvador’s law, unlike the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Shortly thereafter, however, Musk started tweeting about concerns over BTC’s environmental impact and Tesla reversing its crypto payments policy, leading to Bitcoin losing half of its value and the entire crypto market capitulating. In short, Musk tweets lukewarm support for crypto, and the prices go up; Musk posts a meme hinting at his “breakup” with Bitcoin, and the prices go down.For a sector that prizes disintermediation and wide distribution of economic power above all else, the cryptocurrency space has handed a single man way too much sway over its fortunes. The hope is that, sooner rather than later, the crypto market will get over its Musk addiction. At this point, however, the tech mogul’s Twitter talk is one of the most influential exogenous factors moving digital asset prices.At the end of the day, who is Mr. Musk to the crypto industry — an eccentric friend, an adversary, or simply a billionaire having some unfettered fun playing around with a trillion-dollar market?While it is impossible to know what’s on the controversial billionaire’s mind, there is some room for appraisals of what his presence can mean for the industry in the long run — as well as educated guesses about his stances and motivations.Crypto influencer #1As of today, Musk’s influence on crypto asset values shows no signs of receding. Most recently, Musk tweeted a response to a Cointelegraph article where he, passingly, articulated the conditions that can lead to Tesla resuming the practice of accepting Bitcoin transactions. And guess what happened next? That’s right: Bitcoin had recovered a couple of thousand dollars overnight.That is just what pertains to BTC and can thus be considered “serious.” A separate chapter of the Musk-crypto saga is his — presumably, tongue-in-cheek — involvement with various altcoins that can multiply their market capitalizations within hours in response to his tweets. From systematically propping up the memecoin-in-chief Dogecoin (DOGE) to going for more obscure yet poignant items, such as the porn industry-affiliated coin CumRocket (CUMMIES), Musk has had a hand in quite a few price movements.The adverse effects of Musk’s antics on the crypto industry are well-documented. First and foremost, there are retail investors who took inspiration from Tesla’s CEO to make trades that cost them more than they could afford to lose. There are surely many more who have taken losses even without taking heed from Musk directly, falling victim to market-wide slumps that his escapades had triggered.On the scale of the industry, recent volatility storms get in the way of further forging the digital asset reputation as a mature and safe asset class. As a newcomer looking for an alternative place to park your money, how likely would you be to get excited about an investment that can drop 40% in a day following a random tweet? A related concern is that such malleability to potentially malign market manipulation can attract unwanted regulatory attention to the cryptocurrency space.Related: I spy with my laser eye: A Twitter phenomenon to make Bitcoin mainstream?Some still believe that there is an upside to the volatility that Musk perpetuates, as Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of financial advisory firm Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph, “Musk’s involvement in the crypto space is a net positive. Volatility has long been hailed as a driver of volumes and with the adoption.”However, others subscribe to the view that whatever benign outcomes have come out of Musk’s crypto-related publicity, the negatives prevail by a wide margin. Dean Steinbeck, co-founder and chief operating officer of blockchain solutions provider Horizen Labs, told Cointelegraph:“Musk’s behavior has harmed crypto greatly. First, he has perpetuated the red herring argument that Bitcoin is bad for the environment. This argument is bogus and perpetuated by projects with an ulterior motive. Second, the attention Musk brings is from his amateurish tweets that support bullshit meme coins that have no substantive value.”Steinbeck further opined that Musk is “nothing more than a sociopathic billionaire who knows virtually nothing about crypto but believes he is an expert.”What for?Many in the crypto space wonder what is Musk’s motivation for cranking out often contradictory yet reliably market-moving tweets. Could it be as low and coarse as manipulating coin prices for gain? Or, perhaps, the tweets are a byproduct of a good-faith learning process with all its bumps and turns? Or is much of it just for fun?The fun hypothesis appears to be particularly influential, and some crypto market participants are not amused with it.Other crypto influencers, however, are willing to give Tesla’s CEO the benefit of the doubt. Brock Pierce, cryptocurrency investor and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, doesn’t think that Musk’s actions affecting digital assets are ill-intentioned, telling Cointelegraph:“It seems like [Musk] has been very reactive to the different opinions and learnings as he has gone down the crypto ‘rabbit-hole,’ but I do not think it has been opportunistic on his part. I think he is, like what he does in many industries, trying to get deeper and deeper in understanding them. Education is not a linear path, and he is going through his own process and doing it in a very public way because of his large following.”Pierce added that because the cryptocurrency community tends to be forgiving, there is still a chance that Musk could be a very important advocate for the space, provided that his intentions prove to be true over the medium and long term.Related: Death knell for Chinese crypto miners? Rigs on the move after gov’t crackdownOpinions widely diverge with regard to the latter prospect. When asked if Musk has ruined his reputation with the crypto community for good, Greenspan responded:“Emphatically, yes. People in the space are overwhelmingly sick and tired of his capricious intervention in the markets.”Greenspan summarized the popular sentiment by saying that, while many are happy to follow along for the laughs, most are in fact jaded.If the latter is the case for a critical mass of crypto market participants, this could be good news. It will take considerable “Musk fatigue” to break the “Musk spell” and liberate the entire asset class from the whimsical influence of a single powerful person. ",2021-06-15

While the asset has done tremendously well, Richard Bernstein believes that Bitcoin has finally retreated into a bear market.  Bitcoin down 38% from all time high | Source : BTCUSD on TradingView.com Currently, Bernstein is quite pessimistic about technology stocks, which he made evident in 2019. He does not believe in stocks that are geared towards disrupting the current economy. Technology stocks have grown a lot in recent years. With most investors portfolios containing a reasonable amount of technology stocks. The stocks have also shown tremendous growth. Disruption is a word that gets thrown around a lot in the technology sector. But Bernstein still is not impressed by them, calling the tech sector a cyclical sector back in 2017. Regarding inflation, he predicted that inflation will definitely shock investors. “A huge miss on inflation but everybody thinks it’s just temporary,” was a statement he made in regards to economists saying that this is just transitory. But he hopes that the tide will turn at some point. Featured image by Luv Murrell - Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com Tags: bitcoinbtcusdBTCUSDTcryptoinflationoilxbtcusd ",2021-06-15

This eliminates the need to buying bitcoin, but being able to also invest in the asset. The megabank was also a big investor in Blockdaemon’s Series A round that was announced last week. The megabank contributed $5 million out of the $28 million raised. There are reports that the company is looking to invest in other opportunities in the crypto space. Goldman To Offer Ethereum Options An internal memo which circulated on Thursday written by Rajesh Venkataramani was when the global investment bank has officially acknowledged its involvement in crypto trading. In addition to this, Goldman said it has been “selectively onboarding” crypto trading institutions. As a result, expanding the offerings available to investors. Now they’re adding the option to trade ether options and futures. The non-deliverable forwards and futures the bank currently trades are simply ways to place wagers on the price of bitcoin. Now they can also place wagers on ether. They do not physically trade bitcoin or any other crypto asset. The investments are all placed in cash. Investors never actually buy any crypto.

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang On Blockchain During this E3 season, VentureBeat had an interview with Jensen Huang where they talked about various topics, including blockchain and Ethereum. When asked about the current demand issues, the Nvidia CEO commented that the reason cryptocurrencies use their GPUs is because they are the most efficient method. The reason why Ethereum chose our GPUs is because it’s the largest network of distributed supercomputers in the world. It’s programmable. When Bitcoin first came out, it used our GPU. Jensen also said he is excited about Proof of Stake, and that Ethereum is the perfect opportunity for Proof of Stake to shine as it’s an established and credible platform. It’s legitimate. It’s established. There’s a lot of credibility. It works well. A lot of people depend on it for DeFi and other things. This is a great time for proof of stake to come. He also believes that Ethereum will only continue to be more valuable as ETH 2.0 takes hold. There’s a future where the processing of these transactions can be a lot faster, and because there are so many people built on top of it now, Ethereum is going to be valuable.  Ethereum is up 3.96% in the past 24 hours | Source: TradingView GTA 6 Could Feature Cryptocurrencies According to a recent rumor by the credible game leaker Tom Henderson, Rockstar’s next installment in the GTA series could feature a few different cryptocurrencies. I heard recently that in GTA 6, some missions will reward you in bitcoin instead of cash for completing some missions.  The idea is to feature cryptocurrencies as rewards for completing missions, and make them available through an in-game broker.

Surprisingly, this hasn’t had a negative impact on the use of SSDs in enterprises where demand continues to hold strong.IDC also notes that technological advancements in coming years in key areas such as NAND flash will help improve the price-performance ratio of SSD further increasing demand. Surprisingly, while the research does note that the current pricing of SSDs remains volatile and elevated, it pins this on increased demand, while completely ignoring the ongoing global chip shortage, which industry leaders believe could last several years. Another aspect that’s apparently hasn’t been looked into is the rising popularity of the Chia cryptocurrency, which demands more storage for its mining, rather than processing prowess, and has already started driving SSD prices to the north.Also check out our roundup of the best cloud storage services ",2021-06-15

By 21, he was worth $3.2 million.Today, Finman said he holds 423 bitcoins, which were worth about $40,000 each on Tuesday, making his investment total worth about $17 million. Insider viewed documentation confirming his investment.What's a 20-something to do with millions in the bank? Finman shared with Insider what he's since spent his money on and the investments he has on the horizon.$1 million: He dropped out of high school to pursue roboticsAfter Finman made his first million, he dropped out of high school. ""High school sucked. I hated it,"" he said. ""I felt like I wasn't learning anything useful and that I was wasting my time.""He added: ""In retrospect, I'm sure there was some value in a lot of what I was learning, but you can't blame a teenage millionaire for feeling above it all. It all worked out in the end.""Next, his passion for robotics led him to set out to create a real-life Doctor Octopus suit, modeled after the Marvel villain.""It had a major cool factor, as well as use for those with physical disabilities,"" Finman said. The project was meant to be a pilot for a functional tool to help with construction, manufacturing, and healthcare.""Healthcare was one of our main focuses with potential applications, such as being able to hand a surgeon a tool during surgery so they don't have to take their eyes off the patient,"" Finman said. One of the main applications that Finman helped test was for people who lacked the strength to do normal daily activities.""We put the arms on multiple people and found that if you have the physical capability to use a keyboard, you can use these arms to drink a glass of water, lift a heavy object, or even slightly push yourself up, using the mechanical gloves on your hands to control the arms,"" Finman said.His first personal purchase was a pair of headphones.""Some $700 Sennheisers, if I recall correctly,"" he said. ""So no homework, nice headphones, and a 'Doc Ock suit' — what else does a teenager need?""Well, maybe one more thing: ""Of course, I had to be obnoxious and get an Audi R8,"" Finman added.                                        Finman with his Audi R8.

This included working on the alternative-cryptocurrency company Metal Pay. ""I truly believe its founder, Marshall Hayner, is quite the visionary,"" he added.He also invested ""quite a bit of money"" in the currency itself, he said, and took on a public-relations and marketing role at the company, which further padded his savings.In addition to his investment in robotics, Finman has put money into STEM education via STEM Revolution. But he said Metal Pay was by far his largest investment both in time and in finances. While he's no longer involved with Metal Pay, he said the project taught him about the potential of cryptocurrency.""Now I'm moving on to new things ranging from more of the same to the entirely new,"" Finman said. ""But my experience there will influence the way I run businesses and view cryptocurrency for the rest of my life.""It also opened his eyes to other currencies with even greater potential than bitcoin.""Even alternative blockchain technologies may end up being more important than coins themselves,"" he said. ""You only need to look at the NFT craze to see that.""Finman is choosy when it comes to spending his bitcoin investments. When he first decided to use bitcoin to make the Doctor Octopus suit, he said he committed to taking the steps only after determining it could, in fact, be useful in assisting people with physical disabilities.""After coming to that conclusion, I hired robotics experts to assist me — I did have my own robotics talents but needed all the help I could get — and began coming up with the schematics and diving right on in,"" he said. ""That spirit of diving right in is always inside me, but it only comes out when I'm truly passionate about a project.""Saving most of his bitcoin appears to have been the right decision, as the price has risen substantially since he made his first million.""Even to this day, it's hard for me to want to spend any of my bitcoin,"" Finman said. ""Despite the rises and falls, year after year bitcoin seems to just keep rising.""Finman's current spending priority is toward an upcoming project, which he's keeping under wraps.""Right now, all I can say is that I believe we have entered a world where privacy is an absolute rarity,"" Finman said.""Cryptocurrency has its own privacy goals, and I've always admired those, but I've decided to work on a privacy and freedom venture in tech outside of just the finance world,"" he added.""All around us, we are tracked by everything from literal cameras to browser cookies to data mining,"" Finman said. ""And our individual selves have become harder and harder to keep separate from the prying eyes of large corporations and governments."" ",2021-06-15

When Covid-19 lockdowns triggered a recession, they didn’t pull back. They borrowed even more and soon paid even less. After a brief spike, interest rates on corporate debt plummeted to their lowest level on record, bringing a surge in new bonds. Nonfinancial companies issued $1.7 trillion of bonds in the U.S. last year, nearly $600 billion more than the previous high, according to Dealogic. By the end of March, their total debt stood at $11.2 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve, about half the size of the U.S. economy.      #2 Needless to say, this level of corporate debt is not even close to sustainable, and we are starting to see a lot of prominent names go bankrupt.  In fact, one of the largest mall owners in the entire country officially filed for bankruptcy on Sunday… Washington Prime Group, a major mall owner of more than 100 locations across the United States, filed for bankruptcy, citing pandemic-related shutdowns. The Columbus, Ohio-based company filed for Chapter 11 late Sunday, saying Covid-19 “created significant challenges” and that the move is “necessary.” Washington Prime secured $100 million in new funding to support its day-to-day operations so it can “continue in the ordinary course without interruption.” #3 The standard of living in the United States has been going down for a very long time.  Here in 2021, inflation is growing at a much faster rate than wages are, and this is squeezing middle class families like never before.  One of the ways that families are dealing with this is by putting off major purchases, and that is one of the reasons why the average age of the vehicles on our roads has now reached an all-time record high… The average age of vehicles on U.S. roadways rose to a record 12.1 years last year, as lofty prices and improved quality prompt owners to hold on to their cars longer. It was the first time the average vehicle age rose above 12 years, according to data released Monday by research firm IHS Markit. While the average vehicle age has risen steadily over the last 15 years, the trend accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic partly because of a drop in new-car sales, IHS said. #4 America’s growing homelessness crisis has accelerated greatly during the pandemic, and the big cities in California are being hit the hardest.  At this point, it is really difficult to navigate through the streets of San Francisco without stumbling over a tent or stepping in human excrement… For a city as opulent as San Francisco, it’s long been jarring to see the extreme poverty of those experiencing homelessness on its streets. If you walk around downtown, tents, makeshift cardboard beds and human excrement can be seen littering the sidewalks. Impoverished people lie on the ground as a blur of highly paid professionals whiz by. #5 The homelessness crisis is also one of the factors that is fueling the dramatic rise in crime rates that we have been seeing all over the nation.  Once upon a time, millions of eager tourists would flock to Venice Beach, but now the phrase “like hell went to hell” is being used to describe conditions at that once pristine tourist trap… Year-to-date numbers show that robberies have nearly tripled since the same period last year. Homeless-related robberies are up 260 percent; homeless-related assaults with a deadly weapon is up 118 percent; property crimes and area burglaries are up 85 percent; and grand theft auto is up 74 percent. According to Embrich, felony arrests are up 68 percent, while misdemeanor arrests have grown by 355 percent. But arrests aren’t enough: Suspects are often released back onto the streets within hours. #6 The police are the ones that are supposed to protect us from crime and restore order when things get out of control, but now they are leaving public service in record numbers.  After being endlessly demonized by leftist activists and the mainstream media, police officers are either retiring or resigning at a staggering rate…. Police retirements have risen by 45 percent in the past year, with officers opting out of forces across the country amid Black Lives Matter demonstrations that fueled anti-cop rhetoric.     The alarming statistic was revealed by the Police Executive Research Forum on Sunday, with the organization also revealing that resignations rose by 18 percent during the same twelve month period. #7 Have you noticed that many of our cities are becoming disgustingly filthy?  When I was growing up, I often heard the phrase “cleanliness is next to godliness”, but you never hear anyone use it anymore.  These days, filth and grime are everywhere, and that has resulted in widespread infestations.  Many of our cities now have massive problems with rats and bed bugs, but Chicago is the worst of them all… The Windy City is known for quite a few things: hot dogs, deep dish, baseball. But here’s one thing you probably don’t associate with Chicago: bed bugs. Turns out these tiny hitchhiking pests are quite fond of our city, according to the latest numbers available through Atlanta-based Orkin, a company that specializes in pest control services. In fact, Chicago ranked no. 1 on the 2021 list, according to Orkin, reclaiming the top spot for the first time since 2017, when it slipped to no. 3, just behind Baltimore and Washington. For the sixth year in a row, Orkin also ranked Chicago the “rattiest” city in America. #8 I have been writing about the drought in the western half of the country for years, but here in 2021 it is the worst we have ever seen.  As I write this article, an astounding 88 percent of the West is officially in a state of drought… Lakes at historically low levels, unusually early forest fires, restrictions on water use and now a potentially record heat wave: even before summer’s start the US West is suffering the effects of chronic drought made worse by climate change. Eighty-eight percent of the West was in a state of drought this week, including the entire states of California, Oregon, Utah and Nevada, according to official data. #9 When drought gets bad enough, it leads to water shortages, and we will want to watch developments in California very closely.  Water supplies have gotten very tight throughout the state, and officials in Santa Clara County just officially declared “a water shortage emergency”…           Santa Clara County is in extreme drought. We can’t afford to wait to act as our water supplies are being threatened locally and across California. We are in an emergency and Valley Water must do everything we can to protect our groundwater resources and ensure we can provide safe, clean water to Santa Clara County residents and businesses. To better deal with these threats and the emergency they are causing, today my fellow Board Members and I unanimously declared a water shortage emergency condition in Santa Clara County. This declaration, which is among the strongest actions we can take under law, allows Valley Water to work with our retailers, cities and the county to implement regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. We also are urging the County of Santa Clara to proclaim a local emergency and join us in underscoring the seriousness of the threats posed by the extreme drought. Over the past few years, America has been hit by crisis after crisis, and many are yearning for a return to the good old days.  Unfortunately, that simply is not going to happen. The United States is never going to be like it once was.  Too many things have changed, and our culture has been radically transformed over the past several decades. Many of the items that I have shared in this article are simply symptoms of much broader cultural problems.  We are a deeply, deeply sick society, and it is getting worse with each passing day. ***Michael’s new book entitled “Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America” is now available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.*** About the Author: My name is Michael Snyder and my brand new book entitled “Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America” is now available on Amazon.com.  In addition to my new book, I have written four others that are available on Amazon.com including The Beginning Of The End, Get Prepared Now, and Living A Life That Really Matters.

The head of Britain's National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) has warned it is ransomware that's the key threat for most people. ""What I find most worrying isn't the activity of state actors,"" NCSC chief exec Lindy Cameron told a national security audience, joining the chorus of organisations calling out ransomware criminals as the number one cybersecurity threat of the moment. The speech marks the first time that GCHQ, the spy agency and parent body of the National Cyber Security Centre, has acknowledged a cyber threat as being of more concern to the UK than traditional state spying.        ""Four nation states – China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran – have been a constant presence in recent years. And as I've said before, we face a determined, aggressive Russia, seeking traditional political advantage by new, high-tech means,"" said Cameron.                 The NCSC's chief exec was giving defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute's (RUSI) Annual Security Lecture, which took place in between the G7 leaders' summit in Cornwall. The summit itself saw Russia named and shamed for harbouring ransomware criminals ahead of the first meeting between US president Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week. Biden is expected to raise the problem of ransomware gangs with his opposite number. Speaking to RUSI's audience of military officers, espionage officials and political policy wonks, Cameron described the structure of the current ransomware ecosystem – the omnipresent as-a-service model – and noted: ""They may identify embarrassing or business-sensitive material that they can threaten to leak or sell to others. And they might even research your cyber insurance policy to see if you're covered to pay ransoms.""  There might be some forensic evidence the police can pursue occasionally, but less so over time. There might be a flaw in the malware or its deployment that we can make the most of. Even more rarely, we might just be able to get a decryption key. But these groups know what they're doing. And that hardly ever happens.  The US FBI's recent success in recovering a cryptocurrency ransom paid by the Colonial Pipeline Company from ransomware crew Darkside is a very rare one.  Prevention is better than cure  Cameron's speech highlighted what the British government is doing to tackle not only ransomware but national cybersecurity weaknesses as a whole – starting to break from protecting only itself to taking an interest in the security of taxpaying businesses and private citizens alike.  Speech ... NCSC chief exec Lindy Cameron  ""In some respects, our response to ransomware is straightforward: we need to continue to build the UK's cyber resilience so that attacks cannot reach their targets in the first place,"" said Cameron, highlighting her organisation's guidance on how not to get pwned by internet crooks. This is targeted at SMEs and bigger companies alike, including large sections in simple words for executives and non-technical managers to digest. ""It's about preparing, planning, exercising all the way up to board level, working on the assumption that a cybercriminal will be as interested in your weaknesses as a burglar in your open window,"" she added.  G7 nations call out Russia for harbouring ransomware crims ahead of Biden-Putin powwow Ransomware-skewered meat producer JBS confesses to paying $11m for its freedom Risk and reward: Nefilim ransomware gang mainly targets fewer, richer companies and that strategy is paying off, warns Trend Micro Uncle Sam recovers 63.7 of 75 Bitcoins Colonial Pipeline paid to ransomware crew  But on top of the cybersecurity hygiene practices, with which Register readers will be well familiar, there's what Cameron described in her speech as the ""whole-of-nation approach"" to tackling the ransomware menace. She also mentioned ""the cyber insurance industry, which has a role to play in bearing down on the payment of ransoms and cryptocurrency entities who facilitate suspicious transactions."" Britain's interventionist approach to cybersecurity includes a new law giving politicians the power to block mergers and acquisitions of British companies by halting ""potentially hostile foreign direct investment."" The last few months have seen the Conservative government boasting of market interventions that would have Adam Smith spinning in his grave.        Yet perhaps conscious of the huge role played by private industry in securing British businesses, Cameron gave it an unusual public nod, saying: ""The government can't do this alone. We will continue to take a whole-of-society approach to improving the cyber resilience of the UK. Industry, academia, and civil society all have a role to play."" Wide-ranging as it was, the week's focus on international cybersecurity and ransomware so far means Cameron's closing call for more ""partnerships with partners around the world"" might bear fruit – if Russia, China, and others are prepared to play ball. ®  Get our Tech Resources     ",2021-06-15

Capacity utilization rose to 91.3 percent. According to Bloomberg, the refinery run figure is the highest since February last year, before the pandemic wreaked havoc on transport and fuel demand. The capacity utilization rate, for its part, is the highest since January 2020 and has been on the rise for four weeks in a row.   Demand for fuels is indeed improving, and traffic levels are almost back to pre-pandemic levels. However, gasoline demand has been falling while supply has been rising, Bloomberg notes.  Meanwhile, Argus reports that exports of gasoline are on the rise from the Gulf Coast. Loadings of gasoline in the first half of June have topped pre-pandemic levels at 810,000 bpd, Argus reported. This compared with 340,000 bpd in the sale period last year and 720,000 bpd in the first half of June 2019.The report cited the high cost of compliance with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard and growing gasoline demand from Mexico, which is replenishing its reserves of the fuel.Related: How An Oil Pipeline Hack Sent Bitcoin Prices TumblingThese exports would need to rise further to avoid a glut, Bloomberg wrote, citing consultancy Energy Aspects. Meanwhile, demand for fuels will continue to rise in the coming weeks, and fuel stocks should fall below the five-year average next month, Energy Aspects also forecast.   According to GasBuddy, gasoline demand in the United States could hit a record high this summer of between 9.4 and 9.8 million bpd, despite rising prices at the pump.

""More than 50% of adults in developing countries do not have a bank account. Digital currencies could substantially reduce transaction costs and allow more economic activities. This would be a major boost to economic growth."" Hauner found that already, emerging market countries where fewer people have bank accounts tend to be more active in bitcoin trading, showing that one of the uses of cryptocurrencies tends to be a substitute for bank accounts. Relative to GDP, the biggest countries in terms of bitcoin trading volumes are all emerging markets: Kenya, Nigeria, Columbia, South Africa, Russia, and Peru.  Advertisement   Advertisement  Digital currencies could also reduce cross-border payment costs, he said. The use of central bank digital currencies could formalize the economy, raise tax revenue, and reduce corruption and other illegal activities that often depend on the use of cash payments, Hauner added.However, BofA warns that the rise of digital currencies could undermine a country's physical currency through dollarization and inflation. Hauner cautions that digital currencies are more likely to increase than decrease inflation.""Easier access to alternative digital currencies is also likely to increase the volatility of domestic money supply and the exchange rate. Easier access to alternatives also raises the risks of rapid shifts of liquidity out of (or into) the currency and the banks which can magnify macro volatility in already less stable countries. Higher macro volatility would then reduce the effectiveness of policies and undermine the long-term rate of growth,"" he added. Despite the risks, many countries may soon adopt a digital currency. Central banks representing a fifth of the world's population are likely to issue a general purpose CBDC in the next three years, Hauner said, citing the latest Bank of International Settlements survey. Last week, El Salvador voted to establish bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar, the country's national currency.  Advertisement   Advertisement  Hauner also said that concerns about currency substitution, disintermediation, monetary policy effectiveness, and inflation are lower for a central bank digital currency than a private digital currency.  ""A CBDC is a direct claim on the central bank rather than a private financial liability. Thus, a CBDC would have the same credibility (or lack thereof) attached as traditional money,"" said Hauner.   ",2021-06-15

Have an account? Log in. ""Little by little, I started noticing that there were more and more people lining up outside the Bitcoin Center,"" Betancourt, who is now the co-founder of crypto hedge fund BKCoin Capital, recalled in an interview.Betancourt's curiosity was piqued and he went inside. He quickly realized that the line outside the door was for the ATM inside where people could buy bitcoin with cash or debit cards. It was a sign of the wild-west early days of cryptocurrencies when many enthusiasts had no idea how to access the bitcoin network or set up a digital wallet. However, once Betancourt read the bitcoin white paper authored by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the commodity trader, who is well-versed in how precious metals are mined, was immediately intrigued. ""When I first read the Satoshi white paper and understood that there is going to be only a certain amount of bitcoin mined. What's left after that is just supply and demand and simple economics,"" he said. ""If it's something that people want and the demand is high, the price is going to go up. Conversely, if it's something people don't want and there's no demand for it, the price is going to suffer.""3 drivers that could soon reboot the bull marketBitcoin's price has indeed suffered recently.Plagued by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk's concerns over the massive amount of energy consumed in mining bitcoin and regulatory headwinds from China, bitcoin's price tumbled as low as about $30,000 from an all-time high of just above $64,000. But things are already looking up and bitcoin is trading above $40,000 again. Musk on Sunday tweeted that Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin as payment when the cryptocurrency's clean energy usage reaches 50%, causing it to immediately jump above $39,000. On Monday, hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones pitched bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier to which he would allocate 5% along with gold, cash, and commodities. While big-name investors and influential individuals tend to move the markets, Betancourt believes that there have been some positive developments flying under the radar in the crypto market that could really reboot the bull market. One of the examples is the successful Series C fundraise of Ledger, a maker of crypto hardware wallets. The Paris-based company last week closed a $380 million round that values the startup at more than $1.5 billion. Leading the raise was renowned macro investor Dan Tapiero, who launched 10T Holdings, a crypto-focused fund, in February. Another sign of institutional appetite is the $314.15 million fundraise during the same week by Solana Labs, the developer of the Solana blockchain (SOL), in a private token sale. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital.Perhaps the most telling sign was the oversubscription of the junk bonds issued by MicroStrategy, which ramped up its borrowing to $500 million from $400 million to purchase bitcoin. ""These are all very bullish things,"" Betancourt said. ""I'm looking very closely at these very quiet but very positive news because they are essentially telling me that the smart money is still looking at the space, still investing in the space, and there's a lot of appetite for it.""Aside from those bullish signals, bitcoin's first update in four years, Taproot, has been greenlit by miners to take effect in November. Meanwhile, Ethereum's planned EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal)-1559 is slated for July.With these drivers and catalysts underway, Betancourt said it is likely that ether reaches above $3,000 again and bitcoin jumpstarts another bull run. ""We've kind of been muted. We've been in a consolidation stage after May,"" he said. ""But we continue to be bullish, we still think that we are in a bull market and there's a good chance that we'll see all-time highs again before the end of the year.""Why El Salvador's acceptance of bitcoin is 'extremely powerful'In November 2018, Betancourt and his partner Kevin Kang set up BKCoin Capital, which as of April had returned 214.19% since inception compared to the S&amp;P 500's 58.43% during the same period, according to the firm. The duo started by trading crypto independently, trying to capture an inter-exchange arbitrage, which means buying and selling into different exchanges to exploit the price differences at different trading venues. ""At the time, we could capture 30% to 50%, so the market was very inefficient,"" he said. Today, the firm offers a flagship market-neutral strategy, with its main alpha generator being the bitcoin basis trade, which exploits the differences between bitcoin spot and futures prices. As an active trader, Betancourt said the fund could place 50 to 100 trades on any given day, but he also appreciates bitcoin's promise for innovation and financial inclusion. Originally from Latin America, he thinks that El Salvador's decision to recognize bitcoin as legal tender could empower people who are either under-banked or living in nations undergoing hyperinflation. Betancourt adds that while 70% of the population in El Salvador doesn't have access to a bank account, they do have cell phones, making it possible for them to leapfrog the traditional banking system and transact using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via cell phones.He also thinks that a lot of countries could follow the footsteps of El Salvador, which could send ripples through the financial markets and speed up institutional adoption.""The moment any other country also decides to make it a legal tender and it starts transacting with El Salvador, banks must accept it as a form of payment and as a form of currency,"" he said. ""Once a couple of countries decide to do that and then they transact with each other or families transact with other families in each country, that's going to be a key moment in the history of cryptocurrencies.""

Gold prices may be experiencing a classic technical development known as a “back and fill,” which results in a bullish breakout retesting its breakout level before continuing higher.Meanwhile, after the blowout May US inflation report, commodity prices have continued to sag. Lumber prices have fallen below the key 1000 level after running up towards 1700 at the start of the quarter, which in turn has dragged down XHB, the S&P homebuilders ETF. It’s not just lumber: corn, wheat, and even copper prices have been aggressively offered lower over the past few weeks. The exception? Crude oil prices, which continue their slow, steady climb higher.Elsewhere, with measures of volatility down across the board, markets may be complacent heading into the June Fed meeting on Wednesday, June 16. Although equity markets continue to stretch to fresh highs (the Nasdaq 100 has already achieved a new record high while the Russell 2000 isn’t far behind), the Fed and its dot plot could see that even the best laid plans of mice and men go awry.*For commentary from Dan Nathan, Guy Adami, and myself on EUR/USD, USD/JPY, gold prices, among others, please watch the video embedded at the top of this article.Charts of the WeekGold Price Technical Analysis: Daily Chart (March 2020 to June 2021) (Chart 1)EUR/USD Rate Technical Analysis: Daily Chart (March 2020 to June 2021) (Chart 2)USD/JPY Rate Technical Analysis: Daily Chart (March 2020 to June 2021) (Chart 3)                Recommended by                    Christopher Vecchio, CFA   New to Forex Trading?

We saw a large influx of people using Monero to transact in all sorts of commerce.""Criminals and non-criminals alike enjoy using Monero because it's private, fungible money.""While we are disappointed that ransomware groups increasingly demand payment in Monero, we understand why they do, and we expect them to use Monero significantly more in the future.""Ehrenhofer said that some criminal organizations actually offer a discount of between 10 and 20 percent if they are paid in Monero, and expects many will stop accepting Bitcoin altogether for smaller ransoms.""Bitcoin is far more public than most people realize,"" he said. ""Good money in the view of Monero contributors does not leak all transaction information to the public, including attackers, foreign governments, and advertising agencies.""Even so, Ehrenhofer claimed criminal activity makes up ""a tiny minority of Monero's total network activity,"" with most of it instead relating to speculation.""Of course, cryptocurrencies do not cause ransomware,"" he said. ""The recent increase in ransomware is due to a variety of factors, including increased cryptocurrency liquidity, substantially more common cybersecurity insurance, and state-sponsoring of attacker groups.""Goodman said Monero's anonymity comes from various techniques used by the underlying software, including ""Stealth Addresses,"" which make it almost impossible to track a given user's spending.He said: ""It mixes different people's transactions together so that no outside observer can tell which user is which and how much is being spent.""Monero is currently worth around $277, up 4.1 percent on the day, according to CoinMarketCap. It has declined in price from early May when it was briefly worth over $500.  A stock image shows someone typing on a keyboard. Hackers sometimes demand ransom payments be made in cryptocurrency.

It has been a pleasure to work with the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions,” said Joshua Bryant, partner and digital asset advisor at FreedomTrust. “It feels like West Virginia wants us to be here. It is very exciting to see the state encourage entrepreneurship – especially companies in the digital asset and cryptocurrency industry, which we believe will revolutionize finance.”FreedomTrust was launched to meet the growing and untapped market of investors who want to invest in digital assets, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but are unable to do so through their existing financial advisors. The company provides financial advisors with the tools they need for portfolio management, billing, reporting, and compliance. More than 21 million Americans, or approximately 14 percent of the U.S. population, own cryptocurrencies.In 2020, West Virginia created a regulatory fintech sandbox that enables entities that would normally require licensure in the state to partner with financial institutions and test innovative financial products or services for a limited period of 24 months. The program is administered by the Division of Financial Institutions. In April 2021, West Virginia became the second state in the U.S. to create a process for technology companies to transform the insurance industry (insurtech).“Outdated regulations intended for a previous generation of institutions pose a significant hurdle for innovation and development in the burgeoning digital assets and cryptocurrency industry,” said Bryant. “By allowing companies to safely bypass these antiquated regulations, West Virginia is on the cutting edge, positioning the state and companies, like ours, to flourish.”The insurtech process and fintech regulatory sandbox are part of a broader series of initiatives to welcome innovative fintech companies to the Mountain State. Vantage Ventures is leading an effort to provide benefits, such as access to coworking space and potential partners, customers, and capital, to fintech entrepreneurs, especially those addressing the specific challenges facing Appalachians.“Individuals, small businesses and large institutions in other regions have benefitted from the innovative efforts undertaken by entrepreneurs building solutions that strengthen the financial services industry broadly. It is gratifying to see these same benefits extend to West Virginia and its unique needs. Our state's commitment to creatively and responsibly fostering fintech and innovative entrepreneurship will help us with our vision of improving financial security for all,” said Sarah Biller, executive director of Vantage Ventures. “I’m very pleased for the team at FreedomTrust, and I’m excited to see what other innovative solutions emerge from West Virginia and its fintech regulatory sandbox and new insurtech process.”   ",2021-06-15

Lip reading will take the same trajectory as facial recognition as it is pressed into service for surveillance purposes. Reading lips from a distance would obviate the need for microphones. ⁃ Technocracy News & Trends Editor Patrick Wood By: Todd Feathers via Vice A patient sits in a hospital bed, a bandage covering his neck with a small opening for the tracheostomy tube that supplies him with oxygen. Because of his recent surgery, the man featured in this marketing video can’t vocalize. So a doctor holds up a smartphone and records the patient as he mouths a short phrase. An app called SRAVI analyzes the lip movements and in about two seconds returns its interpretation—”I need suction.”  It seems like a simple interaction, and in some respects, SRAVI (Speech Recognition App for the Voice Impaired) is still pretty simplistic. It can only recognize a few dozen phrases, and it does that with about 90 percent accuracy. But the app, which is made by the Irish startup Liopa, represents a massive breakthrough in the field of visual speech recognition (VSR), which involves training AI to read lips without any audio input. It will likely be the first lip-reading AI app available for public purchase.      Researchers have been working for decades to teach computers to lip-read, but it’s proven a challenging task even with the advances in deep learning systems that have helped crack other landmark problems. The research has been driven by a wide array of possible commercial applications—from surveillance tools to silent communication apps and improved virtual assistant performance. Liopa is in the process of certifying SRAVI as a Class I medical device in Europe, and the company hopes to complete the certification by August, which will allow it to begin selling to healthcare providers. While their intentions for the technology aren’t clear, many of the tech giants are also working on lip-reading AI. Scientists affiliated with or working directly for Google, Huawei, Samsung, and Sony are all researching VSR systems and appear to be making rapid advances, according to interviews and Motherboard’s review of recently published research and patent applications. The companies either didn’t respond or declined interviews for this story.       As lip-reading AI emerges as a viable commercial product, technologists and privacy watchdogs are increasingly worried about how it’s being developed and how it may one day be deployed. SRAVI, for example, is not the only application of lip-reading AI that Liopa is working on. The company is also in phase two of a project with a UK defense research agency to develop a tool that would allow law enforcement agencies to search through silent CCTV footage and identify when people say certain keywords. Surveillance company Motorola Solutions has a patent for a lip-reading system designed to aid police. Skylark Labs, a startup whose founder has ties to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), told Motherboard that its lip-reading system is currently deployed in private homes and a state-controlled power company in India to detect foul and abusive language. “This is one of those areas, from my perspective, which is a good example of ‘just because we can do it, doesn’t mean we should,’” Fraser Sampson, the UK’s biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, told Motherboard. “My principal concern in this area wouldn’t necessarily be what the technology could do and what it couldn’t do, it would be the chilling effect of people believing it could do what it says. If that then deterred them from speaking in public, then we’re in a much bigger area than simply privacy, and privacy is big enough.” The emergence of lip-reading AI is reminiscent of facial recognition technology, which was a niche area of research for decades before it was quietly, but rapidly, commercialized as a surveillance tool beginning in the early 2000s.

Over 1,000 participants associated with Advisor Group's six subsidiary firms – FSC Securities, Royal Alliance, SagePoint Financial, Securities America, Triad Advisors and Woodbury Financial Services – are expected to join the virtual event, which is being held from June 16 to 18 and is themed ""The Path."" W Forum is a central part of Advisor Group's Women Forward Initiative, which offers a year-round series of career enrichment and networking opportunities along with mentorship and development resources to support women financial professionals in achieving business growth and success. Wealth Management Platform Generates Record Growth, Complements Recruiting As part of the event, Advisor Group today announced record monthly asset growth for its Wealth Management Platform (WMP), a comprehensive suite of investment advisory programs, technology solutions and expert support resources aimed at helping financial professionals grow and manage fee-based accounts.  In May, WMP saw inflows of more than $1 billion in net new assets (NNA), representing Advisor Group's strongest-ever month for growth on its WMP and the first time monthly NNA has exceeded the $1 billion threshold. Women financial professionals contributed proportionately to this increase and were responsible for nearly 20% of the record growth. In addition to surpassing the $1 billion mark in NNA last month, the platform has added at least $4.8 billion in NNA through May of this year, compared with about $1.4 billion for the same period in 2020. NNA encompasses accounts of existing clients that are moved to WMP, as well as assets added through recruitment of new financial professionals and M&amp;A activity, net of attrition. The NNA figures include asset growth at FSC Securities, Royal Alliance, SagePoint and Woodbury, the four firms that made up the Advisor Group network prior to its acquisition of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, including Securities America and Triad Advisors, in February 2020. Monthly NNA totals are expected to continue to grow significantly going forward, as asset reporting for the former Ladenburg firms is harmonized with Advisor Group's legacy firms and their NNA metrics are included in the firm's enterprise-wide totals. Continued strong recruiting results are expected to fuel further growth in NNA inflows. Honoring Allison Pratt Upon Her Retirement As part of the commencement of the conference, Advisor Group announced the retirement of Executive Vice President, National Sales Allison Pratt, following a nearly 35-year career in the independent wealth management industry, including the last seven years at Advisor Group. Ms. Pratt's decision to retire follows family health matters and her desire to prioritize family at this time. Ms. Pratt will continue to serve in her current role until August 6, 2021. Ms. Pratt has played a central role in Advisor Group's success as the head of its national sales organization, which includes investment advisory services, retirement plan consulting services, insurance consulting services, advanced planning, product sales support, business coaching and consulting services, and strategic partner relations. As part of her role, Ms. Pratt has overseen Advisor Group's Wealth Management Platform since 2016, when the full-year net new assets figure was $1.4 billion in total, compared against the $1 billion in NNA for the month of May alone this year. Commenting on the record monthly NNA growth, Ms. Pratt said, ""These exceptional results didn't just happen – they are the result of a multi-year effort to carefully plant the seeds of growth, as well as a tremendous amount of hard work, diligence and persistence on the part of the thousands of independent financial professionals across our network. They also stem from Advisor Group's proactive stance in adapting to the new fiduciary era, and from significant investments from Reverence Capital in growing the sales and consulting resources we make available to our financial professionals, ensuring that all of our product lines seamlessly align to benefit the end client."" Ms. Pratt continued, ""Our focus on positioning all of our financial professionals for success in the fiduciary era is mirrored by our commitment to building a stronger industry overall that reflects the diversity of our broader society. Growing the ranks of women financial professionals across our firms is an indispensable part of Advisor Group's overall success story."" ""The progress we have made in lifting women in the wealth management space has been one of the proudest accomplishments of my professional life. As I step away from a rewarding and fulfilling career, I am gratified to know that Advisor Group is in the strongest position in its history, and I look forward to an even brighter future for women in our industry in the years ahead."" The Wealth Management Platform includes four investment advisory programs – Genesis Model Portfolios, Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs), Unified Managed Accounts (UMAs) and Advisor Managed Portfolios. Advisor Group has consistently expanded and enhanced the platform in recent years, including reducing minimum investments for UMAs; expanding its product shelf to include select retail alternative investments; strengthening its focus on innovative high-net-worth solutions; relaunching asset-based pricing, thereby eliminating conflicts related to traditional ticket charges; and redesigning the platform to provide a streamlined and more advisor-friendly user experience. Greg Cornick, Advisor Group's President, Advice and Wealth Management, said, ""Advisor Group is committed to supporting women financial professionals and know they are well-positioned in an industry increasingly driven by trusted relationships and a shift to holistic planning. Their success growing advisory assets has contributed to Advisor Group's record-breaking month. Our Wealth Management Platform's outstanding performance in attracting net new assets is also a testament to the work that Allison and her team have accomplished to support financial professionals' adoption of advisory business models. Going forward, we will continue to proactively invest in the services, technology and platforms that our financial professionals need to do their best work for clients."" 'VISIONARIES' HEADLINE W FORUM AGENDA This year's W Forum marks the first time the event will combine elements of Advisor Group's Women Forward Initiative and the Ladenburg Institute of Women and Finance, Ladenburg Thalmann's former network-wide program supporting growth for women financial professionals. This year's W Forum theme, ""The Path,"" focuses on supporting women financial professionals in defining their visions of success in life and in their careers while helping them chart a roadmap to achieve their goals. As in prior years, the event will feature W Forum Visionaries, a series of TED Talk-style presentations by four female financial professionals aimed at sparking inspiration among attendees. This year's Visionaries are:   Rita Robbins, Founder and President of Affiliated Advisors, on ""Embracing the Third Phase of Life;""  Gujral Jyoti, Principal of Financial Solutions Group, on ""Connecting Passion with Purpose;""  Monica Brown, on ""The Art of Continuous Evolution;""  Kelly O'Malley, with ""How I Increased My AUM by 40% in 90 days.""  W Forum will also feature:   A Talk with Patty Jenkins: Advisor Group's Chief Marketing Officer, Susan Theder, will interview the award-winning writer, producer and director in a featured general session segment.  Trends in Wealth Management: Advisor Group's President and CEO, Jamie Price, and Executive Vice President of Advisor Engagement, Erinn Ford, will discuss trends in the wealth management industry that will affect financial professionals' businesses.  Discussion of Advisor Group Women's Initiatives: Advisor Group Senior Vice President of Wealth Management Marketing, Katey Davern, and Ladenburg Asset Management Chief Operating Officer, Jaime Desmond, will provide updates on Advisor Group's women's initiatives.  Round Table Discussions: Collaborative working sessions will offer small groups of participants an opportunity to discuss critical topics with colleagues.  Jamie Price, CEO of Advisor Group, said, ""It's a great honor for us to bring together women financial professionals, assistants and home-office staff from across the country to share best practices and support each other in their professional endeavors. I believe it is crucial to the future of our industry to find ways to increase the opportunities for growth and advancement for women professionals, and with the W Forum and the Women Forward Initiative, we are putting the resources and expertise of the entire Advisor Group network behind that goal."" Mr. Price concluded, ""We thank Allison Pratt for many contributions to Advisor Group. Allison has done an incredible job in expanding and enhancing our Wealth Management Platform.  The strength of our Wealth Management Platform, combined with our ongoing investments in growth resources for our financial professionals, make Advisor Group extremely well-positioned to continue to lead in the independent wealth management space.""

NFTs are digital files underpinned by blockchain technology – the same technology on which popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum rest. But unlike cryptocurrencies, an NFT is totally unique and the blockchain ledger it sits on verifies who the rightful owner is of that one-of-a-kind item. The NFT of Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web code includes four elements: the original time-stamped files containing the source code he wrote; a moving visualisation of nearly 10,000 lines of code; a letter written by Berners-Lee describing the code and the process of creating it; and a digital “poster” of the full code he created from the original files using the programming language Python, according to a Sotheby’s press release. Berners-Lee was working at Europe’s physics research centre CERN when he presented his idea, titled Mesh at the time and later to be known as the World Wide Web. His boss’s feedback? “Vague but exciting”. Berners-Lee’s 1989 invention of the World Wide Web went on to revolutionise how the world creates and shares information. Three decades after the vision was first presented on one server and one website, there are over 1.7 billion websites connecting 4.6 billion people, according to Sotheby’s. “For me, the best bit about the web has been the spirit of collaboration,” Berners-Lee said in a statement included in the Sotheby’s press release. “While I do not make predictions about the future, I sincerely hope its use, knowledge and potential will remain open and available to us all to continue to innovate, create and initiate the next technological transformation that we cannot yet imagine,” he added. The files up for auction include 9,555 lines of code that have implementations of the three languages and protocols invented by Berners-Lee: HTML (hypertext markup language), HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), and URIs (uniform resource identifiers), according to Sotheby’s. Also included are original HTML documents that detail how to use the application. NFTs have recently soared in popularity. In March, a digital-only artwork by American artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold for nearly $70m at Christie’s auction house. “At Sotheby’s we see NFT as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a bridge from the digital world to the institutional auction world,” Hatton told Al Jazeera. “To put it all into context, the source code to the web is a digital artefact that has existed since 1990, but until NFTs it would not have been something that we could ever have sold,” she added. Last week a digital artwork called CryptoPunk sold as an NFT for $11.8m at Sotheby’s. And in April, digital artist Pak fetched a total of $16.8m, also at a Sotheby’s NFT auction. The sale of the World Wide Web code will benefit initiatives that Berners-Lee and his wife support, the auction house said.

Even with its price down 92% after debuting during an inopportune period, we think this one is worth exploring, both as a blockchain project and a coin.What is Internet Computer?If we had to describe Internet Computer in one phrase, we would call it a ‘decentralized version of the internet.’ Unlike the web we all use now, which revolves around a few tech companies, Internet Computer (ICP) allows all users to create apps, websites and other web-based services.One way to think of it is as a decentralized computer network that could run a new or different version of apps on the web. For this reason, the project’s founder says it has the capacity to challenge internet titans such as Google, Facebook and Amazon Web Services. And given its highly decentralized network, Internet Computer can scale its capacity with increases in demand,It might be more useful to think of Internet Computer as less of a cryptocurrency and more as a network that uses blockchain technology to power apps. The project is run by the Dfinity Foundation, who also created cryptocurrency powering this decentralized internet.Instant popularityUpon its initial release, Internet Computer almost instantly reached a top 10 crypto spot, though now residing at 18th. There were a few factors behind this.First was the potential of the project, which was quickly understood by the crypto community. There are many ambitious projects out there like Cardano and Polygon, and this one is right up there with them. It’s founder, Dominic Williams, claims that the speed of the cryptocurrency, its ability to scale quickly and its ability to drastically reduce computing costs will make it possible to take on some of the biggest tech names. It’s also backed by many big-name investors, such as Andreessen Horowitz, a top venture capital firm, and Polychain Capital, which specializes in venture capital for crypto.Story continuesWhat makes it unique?So how does Internet Computer stand out from other projects out there? The main thing is perhaps the possibility for anyone to create software on the internet. The technology allows anyone to use its blockchain technology to create apps and lets them do an end-run around the big tech companies.Another important point is that it runs on a decentralized network, not the cloud. Unlike many other blockchains, Internet Computer runs on dedicated hardware set up by independent parties. This was the original selling point when Dfinity started raising money in 2018.It’s also fast. Completing transactions using some cryptocurrencies may take 30 minutes or more. ICP boasts that its crypto operates at web speed and can finalize transactions in three to five seconds.Ethereum linkup and community controlIt seems the public debut of Internet Computer and its coin crashing haven’t slowed its team down. Dominic Williams recently announced that they will integrate with the Ethereum network, which could act as a catalyst for adoption.Dfinity also addressed doubts about how decentralized it truly was, as well as some privacy issues. They announced that the community now controls 60% of the network’s voting power and that that percentage will grow, as more ICP tokens are distributed and staked.RecapEven though Internet Computer has dropped out of the top 10 and doesn’t seem to be recovering as quickly as others, this is a project that has scalability baked in.With a strong team, financial backing, and many potential partnerships, this is definitely one blockchain we’ll keep an eye on.",2021-06-15

It took only 90 seconds for Baton Rouge police officer Blane Salamoni to threaten to kill and then kill Sterling that fateful night. However, it took nearly two years for the body camera footage to be released and for Salamoni to be fired. What was particularly troublesome about the release of the video is the fact that Salamoni wasn’t fired until it was released — two years later.      Now, after years of jumping through political hoops, Sterling’s children are finally seeing some sort of justice in the form of a taxpayer-funded payout. The attorneys representing Sterling’s estate, released the following statement on news of the settlement. “On behalf of the family of Alton Sterling, we are pleased to announce that we have reached a $4.5 million settlement with the city of Baton Rouge and dismissed our lawsuit against the city and others. This settlement, which was reached through hard work and collaboration between attorneys for Mr. Sterling’s family and the Baton Rouge City Council, will allow the city to heal and provide a pathway for Mr. Sterling’s children to be provided for financially. Additionally, we are grateful for the significant policy changes that have been and will be implemented by the city of Baton Rouge and the Baton Rouge Police Department following Mr. Sterling’s death. Our hope is that these policy changes, which focus on de-escalation, providing verbal warnings prior to using deadly force and prohibiting officers from both using chokeholds and firing into moving vehicles, will ensure that no other family has to endure the trauma and heartbreak that Mr. Sterling’s family went through and will create a better future going forward for Baton Rouge residents.” A statement from Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome said the settlement “marks a milestone in this traumatic chapter of our community’s history.” Traumatic indeed. Sterling’s death prompted violent clashes with police as well as a mass shooting. The “investigation” was also tainted from the start as police and investigators had video evidence the same night Sterling was killed yet they did nothing with it and waited until their officers were cleared in his death before releasing it. As the body camera footage shows, officer Howie Lake II was already on the scene when Salamoni showed up. Sterling was not being combative and had simply been picking up his sales table for his CDs which he had permission from the owner to sell in front of the store. Police were responding to a call from a homeless man who some claim was disgruntled after Sterling refused to give him money and ran him off from the store. The homeless man reportedly told police that Sterling was armed. When Salamoni arrived, within a few seconds, he had his pistol trained on Sterling and was immediately threatening to kill him. As Sterling asks police why he’s being harassed and subsequently held at gunpoint for selling CDs, Salamoni threatens to kill him. “Don’t f—– move or I’ll shoot your f—- a–. Put your f—— hands on the car,” Salamoni shouts.     When the officers attempt to get Sterling to put his hands on the hood of the car, a struggle ensues and the officers bring Sterling to the ground. One of the officers shouts, “He’s got a gun!” and gunshots then ring out. When the officers stand up, Sterling is in a pool of his own blood, the gun that he never went for remained in his pocket. An internal police investigation into Sterling’s actions determined the officers’ actions “were not minor deviations from policy” then-Chief Murphy Paul said. Paul cited “fear” as the factor that determined why the officer was fired. Salamoni created a situation in fear and hostility and violence were used instead of de-escalation. “Our police officers are held to a higher standard,” Chief Paul said. “Fear cannot be a driver for an officer’s response to every incident. Unreasonable fear in an officer is dangerous.” Indeed, unreasonable fear is the reason cops in America kill more citizens than any other country in the world. “Today you saw that Alton Sterling was not some wild, deranged? Cocaine-filled, high, big black man who was out of control. The person who was out of control was Blane Salamoni,” Michael Adams, another lawyer for the Sterling family said at the time the body camera footage was released.           “Never once pushed an officer, touched an officer, kicked an officer, did anything,” Stewart said. “But yet he ended up dead.”    Source: The Free Thought Project Matt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.

He estimated that the number of ransomware attacks in 2021 could end up being as high as 100,000, with each one costing companies an average of $170,000.In the case of Colonial, just one password was needed for hackers to compromise the entire company’s IT infrastructure. This led to Colonial and JBS paying a combined $15 million in ransom against FBI advice. (The Justice Department later recovered about $2.3 million of the cryptocurrency, about half of Colonial’s initial ransom.)“I think [cybersecurity is] one of the top three issues facing corporate boardrooms,” Chambers, currently COE and founder of JC2 Ventures, added. “And being very candid, having been the CEO and a chairman, it's uncomfortable because you get your chief information security officer up in front of the court. They show the data. And your board looks at you, and they say, can you prevent this?”Though prevention measures are pivotal, when a company does succumb to a cyberattack, Chambers says the next step is to focus on an effective recovery strategy often facilitated by cybersecurity companies like Rubrik. He sees startups playing a key role in serving as the next generation of cybersecurity providers that offer services on both the preventative and recovery ends.According to Chambers, hackers in the SolarWinds (SWI) attack were able to gain access to the company’s systems six months before the problem was even identified.“Only six years ago [at the World Economic Forum in 2015] I said there are only two types of companies in the world—those that have been hacked and those that don't know they've been hacked—and it was like a major statement of surprise,” Chambers said. “Yet today we understand how this is going to come at every company.”Story continuesChambers also stressed the need for companies to improve their identification capabilities to secure the integrity of their private information and computing systems. He pointed to voice identification technology as being one of the major tools for companies to ensure that only individuals with the proper credentials have access to their systems.“You’ve also got to make it much easier for identification,” Chambers said. “The way that often these hacks occur is they come in through a traditional call center or they come in through another connection.”Chambers believes that the reasons behind the recent slew of successful ransomware attacks may be a combination of inadequate technology and improper allocation of resources into preventative measures. The solution, which may also make for lucrative investment opportunities, Chambers says, may lie in cybersecurity startups that put the integrity of companies’ tech infrastructure to the test and provide feedback on how they can improve.“I know most CEOs really take this serious now,” Chambers said. “And we've realized whether you're in meat-packing—as you did with Senator Tester the other day, where he said our critical infrastructure is being attacked from everywhere imaginable—or you're in hospitals or you're in pipelines, the CEOs want to keep their company secured.”A sign is seen as Exxon station is out of gas after a cyberattack crippled the biggest fuel pipeline in the country, run by Colonial Pipeline, in Washington, U.S., May 15, 2021.

After reaching a… [+3445 chars]",Investopedia,"  Bitcoin is on the rise once again.    The cryptocurrency’s price surged past $40,000, a figure it last touched on May 18. The increase marks a sharp reversal from Bitcoin’s recent slump. After reaching a record high in April, the cryptocurrency’s price had ticked downward. But the swell in its prices over the weekend might have arrested that decline.    At 23:56 UTC on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at $40,343.92, a roughly 2% increase in its price from a day earlier. It is up by 37.5% since the beginning of this year.     Why Did Bitcoin’s Price Increase?    Bitcoin’s climb started early Sunday when it was trading at $35,000. By Monday, the cryptocurrency had registered a 17% increase in its price to cross $40,000. Two news developments contributed to the latest bump in Bitcoin’s price, according to reports.    The first one was Tesla CEO Elon Musk's tweet saying that, due to the energy consumption and the accompanying environmental damage of Bitcoin, he would no longer allow Teslas to be purchased with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is estimated to use an amount of electricity roughly equal to that of the entire country of Argentina. Musk wielded the social media platform’s megaphone again on Sunday morning to partially reverse course.    Musk tweeted that his company might resume allowing Bitcoin transactions if there was “confirmation of reasonable (approximately 50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend."" According to reports, buyers moved into crypto markets to purchase Bitcoin after his tweet.       On Monday morning, hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones further accelerated the cryptocurrency’s price increase. Jones, who has invested 2% of his net assets in Bitcoin, said he considered the cryptocurrency to be a “great diversifier."" “Everybody asks me what should I do with my Bitcoin. The only thing I know for certain is that I want 5% in gold, 5% in bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in commodities,” he told CNBC.    Tudor Jones is among an increasing number of institutional investors and hedge fund owners pivoting away from traditional financial instruments towards Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s enthusiasts in recent times have included investing titans such as Stanley Druckenmiller, Ray Dalio, and BlackRock’s Larry Fink.    Their positive assessments of Bitcoin have been complemented with a widening array of crypto offerings by investment firms. For example, State Street recently launched a new division that will offer services related to decentralized finance and the digital economy. Prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs offers Bitcoin futures exposures to clients.     Bitcoin’s Underlying Problems Remain    While these developments bring much needed liquidity to its ecosystem, the cryptocurrency still remains a combustible asset prone to enormous price swings in short periods of time. Just this year, the cryptocurrency’s price traversed a wide territory between a record high of above $63,000 and a low below $32,000 in a period of two months.    Bitcoin’s underlying problems -- from high energy use for Bitcoin mining to a trading ecosystem dominated by a few large players like Tesla -- also persist. The overhang of regulation on the cryptocurrency’s price also remains. Countries around the world, including China and Iran, are hardening their stance and cracking down on crypto mining and trading.    In the United States, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler recently cautioned investors against Bitcoin markets. “Investors should be aware – I’m saying this is in my own voice – that the underlying Bitcoin cash markets there’s not the robust oversight that you have in the stock market or the derivatives markets,” he told attendees at a conference.   ",2021-06-15

Every bull market, bitcoin experiences a large influx of first-time investors. Most of them FOMO-ing into the market. Once the expected crashes start happening, they get scared and start getting rid of their coins. What An Increased Bullish Sentiment Could Mean With an asset as volatile as bitcoin, price movements can very much be tied to investors sentiment. Humans are mostly governed by emotions so it is no surprise that this spills out into other parts of our lives like investing. Feeling very positive about something is a reason why a lot of investors buy assets. A large portion of the decision making can be attributed to research but sentiment, either good or bad, can most often be a deciding factor.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                   Bitcoin price crashed about 50% in May | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.Com Once people start feeling like the market is about to have a good run, they invest into the market. This in turn shows other investors that people still have faith in the coin. And the cycle continues leading to a bull run. How Fear And Greed Affect Market Prices Investors are mostly driven by two emotions when they are putting money in the market; fear and greed.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  When investors are scared of what an asset might do, this could lead to them putting way less money into that asset than they normally would. Not wanting to lose their money. It does not matter if there is a reason to be scared of not. If investors do not have faith in an asset, they will not put money in it. Then on to greed, this is the ultimate market mover. The dictionary definition of greed is as follows; an intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth, power, or food. Investors are in the market to make money, as much as possible in as little time as possible. While long-term hodling might be the best move when it comes to investing, it doesn’t change the fact that people want money now. And they want a lot of it. Related Reading | MicroStrategy Sells $500 Million Notes To Buy Bitcoin This is where greed comes in. The more money you want to make, the more money you have to put into the market. The more money put into an asset, the higher the value of that asset. Arcane Research has a Fear and Greed Index with which it measures investors fear relative to greed. And it has been in the extreme fear zone for quite a while. This has been in line with market prices. Bitcoin has been stagnating a bit for a while. People are not putting money in it. But a recently released index from Arcane Research has shown that investors sentiment has finally moved out of the extreme fear into fear. This signals that investors are finally starting to come out of hiding.     Fear and Greed Index up from  13 last week to 38 | Source: Fear and Greed Index on Arcane Research   Lightning Network Sets New Record The Bitcoin Lightning Network exceeded 1,500 BTC for the first time ever yesterday on the network.

It’s a balancing act that very few have managed to master. The key is data literacy; educating employees on data governance and best practices so that everyone speaks the same language when it comes to data. Data literate employees are known by Collibra as “data citizens.” Broadly defined as “anyone who uses data to do their job,” Christiaens pointed out that while in the past this may have been restricted to data scientists and statisticians, in today’s data-driven businesses it includes almost the entire organization. “From our experience, both building our own data office and helping our customers do the same, personal responsibility around data starts with data literacy,” Christiaens stated. “Investing in data literacy builds a foundation for understanding around data that means you will not only improve data protection, but also be better equipped to build trust in your data and innovate based on insights from your data.” Data professionals are invited to hone their data literacy skills and hear from companies that have successfully created data-first cultures in the workplace during Data Citizens ’21. The virtual conference is taking place on June 16 and 17 and can be watched live from across the globe. Registration is free, and theCUBE analysts will be talking with data leaders about how organizations are executing their data intelligence journeys. (* Disclosure below.) Collibra data citizens community creates data literacy Founded to solve enterprise data governance problems, Collibra has already created an online community of users, dubbed “data citizens,” and set about to educate its customers in data best practices. Collibra University offers free courses in data stewardship and governance for everyone from data beginners to experienced developers. While learning is important, half the fun of attending university is getting to know your cohorts. Data Citizens ’21 brings the data  professional community together to network, share ideas, gain knowledge and be inspired by the stories and real-life experiences of industry and product experts. “A big part of why we care so much about the conference is that it is an opportunity to build that data citizens community …  bringing those people together that all care about the same topic and are passionate about doing more with data,” Felix Van de Maele, chief executive officer of Collibra, told theCUBE. Neil deGrasse Tyson debates data possibilities “Breaking the boundaries of what is possible in data and life,” is the topic scheduled for a discussion session between famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and Tifenn Dano Kwan, chief marketing officer for Collibra. Known for his application of scientific logic to some of the biggest philosophical questions asked by humankind, deGrasse Tyson’s session promises to be both enlightening and amusing.  While deGrasse Tyson may be a big draw for the event, all the sessions will hold critical insights and information for data professionals. From keynotes to use cases to technological dives, attendees at Data Citizens ’21 can choose a custom timeline that covers the topics most relevant to their personal data journey. A sampling of the 50 sessions occurring over the two days includes data experts from George Washington University, the University of Utah, and Western Governors University discussing data intelligence in higher education; robotics and artificial intelligence pioneer Dr. Ayanna Howard, who has been profiled by theCUBE for our Women in Tech feature, debating “What happens when AI goes rogue?” with Collibra’s chief information security officer, Myke Lyons; and social media platforms Twitter Inc. and Yelp Inc. sharing how they use Collibra’s data governance platform to enable data compliance and data discovery. The role of data intelligence in pharmaceutical development is also discussed by experts from Edwards Lifesciences Corp. and Roche group member Genentech Inc. And refrigeration specialist Sub-Zero Inc. is just one of several companies sharing its experiences on the journey to becoming data-driven. CDOs get personal Chief data officers hold the front lines in a data-driven company, and the event includes sessions covering topics of specific interest to data executives.  “The CDO is the most senior person in an organization responsible for ensuring data is treated as an asset,” Caroline Carruthers, chief executive for Carruthers and Jackson Ltd., told theCUBE.  While CDOs are expected to be data experts, they also need to have interpersonal skills, according to Carruthers, who is hosting a session with Peter Jackson, chief data and analytics officer at Exasol AG, on why data leaders need to pay attention to their relationship skills. Networking is encouraged during topic-based roundtable Data Citizens Circles. Led by Collibra’s data experts, these interactive sessions give attendees a chance to discuss their organization’s data challenges and learn problem-solving techniques and best practices. These sessions are limited capacity, so reserve your place by registering for Data Citizens ’21 now. “At Collibra, we believe that data is for everyone, and we want to empower all data citizens to access the right data when they need it – whether it’s to do everyday things, or to think bigger and answer questions with data they never asked before,” Christiaens said. Livestream of Data Citizens ’21 Data Citizens ’21 is a livestream event that includes interviews to be broadcasted on theCUBE. You can register for free here to access the live event.

Access to their services can directly impact an individual, company, or nonprofit’s ability to survive and thrive in our digital world,” said EFF International Director of Freedom of Expression Jillian York. “But while companies like Facebook and YouTube have faced substantial scrutiny for their history of account closures, financial companies like PayPal have often flown under the radar. Now, the human rights community is sending a clear message that it’s time to change.”      The coalition sent a letter to PayPal and Venmo today, voicing particular concern about account closures that seem to have been used to pressure or single-out websites that host controversial—but legal—content. PayPal shut down the account of online bookseller Smashwords over concern about erotic fiction, and also refused to process payments to the whistleblower website WikiLeaks. Last year, Venmo was sued for targeting payments associated with Islam or Arab nationalities or ethnicity, and there are also numerous examples of sex worker advocates facing account closures. Today’s letter calls on PayPal and Venmo to provide more transparency and accountability around its policies and practices for account freezes and closures, including publishing regular transparency reports, providing meaningful notice to users, and offering a timely and meaningful appeals process.  These recommendations are in alignment with the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation, a set of principles developed by free expression advocates and scholars to help companies center human rights when moderating user-generated content and accounts. “More transparency into financial censorship helps civil liberties and human rights advocates see patterns of abuse,” said EFF Chief Program Officer Rainey Reitman. “It’s vital that PayPal and Venmo follow in the steps of other companies and begin publishing annual transparency reports.” The signers of today’s letter include 7amleh – The Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media, Access, ACLU of Northern California, American Civil Liberties Union, Article 19, the Center for Democracy and Technology, Center for LGBTQ Economic Advancement & Research (CLEAR), Demand Progress Education Fund, European Legal Support Center (ELSC), Fight for the Future, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Global Voices, Masaar-Technology and Law Community, Mnemonic, New America’s Open Technology Institute, PDX Privacy, the Tor Project, Taraaz, Ranking Digital Rights, Restore the Fourth Minnesota, and SMEX.

However, I believe these concerns are overblown. Instead, investors should focus on the company's strong fundamental businesses. In this article, we will discuss how the ARM acquisition could make NVDA an even stronger company over the long run. In addition, we will discuss NVDA's latest earnings, financials, trading, and valuation so readers could reach their own informed decision. (Note: Unless otherwise noted, all forecasted financials refers to consensus estimates and all historical financial data comes from the company). Earnings: Great Results, With Crypto Overhang We will start by quickly going over the company's latest earnings to level-set everyone before moving to the main topic of considering the company's business fundamentals. NVDA reported FY Q1 earnings (FY ending Jan) on May 27, resulting in the stock trading down -1.4% on the day after earnings. Revenue grew 83.8% y/y to $5.7 billion, beating consensus estimates by 4.9%. Gross margin came in at 66.2% while operating margin came in at 45.2% compared to 38.8% a year ago. EPS for the quarter was $3.66, up 103% y/y and beating consensus by 11.3%. These are great earnings results, but the stock reacted poorly initially due to concerns about cryptocurrencies' increasing contribution. However, unlike the last crypto boom-bust cycle in 2017-2018, investors and management are much more prepared. If you recall, barely anyone knew about Ethereum (ETH-USD) during the last cycle. As it turned out, NVDA's GPUs are excellent for mining ETH and other altcoins. This cycle, however, management did three things to manage the crypto risk and opportunity:  It introduced and heavily promoted a GPU just for crypto mining. While the company sold a dedicated miner during the last cycle, the company did not promote these products. The company discouraged miners from buying its gaming GPUs by significantly reducing its hash rate if crypto mining is detected. Management spent a lot more time this cycle communicating to a very alert investor base about its crypto exposure and its associated risks.  In my view, crypto will unlikely be a major headwind on the stock like it was during the last cycle. Business: ARM Advantage Instead of wasting too much time worrying about crypto, investors should instead focus on NVDA's fundamentals, and one of the most exciting fundamental catalysts is the pending acquisition of ARM. Source: Company In September 2020, NVDA announced the $40 billion acquisition of ARM, taking advantage of SoftBank's (OTCPK:SFTBY) need to raise cash following the collapse of WeWork. Despite loud objections by competitors, as of June 2021, NVDA management still believes that the deal will close in the early part of 2022. Since discussions with regulators are confidential, without evidence to the contrary, we should give management the benefit of the doubt. However, through personal conversations, I must point out that very few people on the buy-side or sell-side believe that the deal will go through. This skepticism, however, means the stock will unlikely react very negatively if the deal does not go through. Source: Company ARM is the world's most popular computing platform, with 180 billion chips shipped. NVDA has used ARM's technology for years, and by acquiring the company, NVDA seeks to create the leading computing company for the age of AI. There are several reasons why acquiring ARM could make NVDA a stronger company:  First, leveraging ARM's large ecosystem, management can bring NVIDIA GPU and AI technology to large end markets, including mobile and PCs. Second, in the data center space, management can turbocharge ARM's R&amp;D and meet cloud computing customers' demand for a higher velocity ARM server CPU roadmap. Third, NVDA can accelerate its edge AI and IoT roadmap and growth trajectory for the next wave of computing. The combination will boost the company's ecosystem of developers from 2 million to over 15 million.  At the time of the acquisition, NVDA didn't do much business with ARM. However, now we know that NVDA was planning to announce its first data center CPU, Grace. With this knowledge, it makes a lot more sense that NVDA wants to acquire the value it will create in the ARM ecosystem by owning ARM rather than being a licensee. While ARM has been widely successful in mobile, its traction within the data center has been hampered by the lack of a widely adopted ecosystem. NVDA's rapidly growing data center business, through its total dominance of AI training and increasing dominance of AI inference workloads, and its CUDA platform could provide just enough heft to bring ARM server CPUs into the mainstream. Source: Company The combined company (NVIDIARM?) will be a massive juggernaut in the semiconductor space and, frankly, a threat to major players in the ecosystem. For example, if ARM server CPU becomes wildly successful, this would mean bad news for AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), who currently share the CPU market. The ARM acquisition looks like a win-win situation for all parties involved. SoftBank is $12 billion in cash and gets to participate in the upside with $21.5 billion in common stock. ARM employees will be highly motivated to execute Jensen's vision since they get $1.5 billion in NVDA shares and a $5 billion performance-based earn-out delivered in cash or NVDA shares. The deal is expected to provide substantial revenue synergies on ARM's $1.8 billion of revenue (trailing twelve months at the time of the announcement) and be immediately accretive to NVDA's gross margins and EPS due to ARM's 94% gross margin profile and recurring revenue business model. Financial NVDA's revenue grew by a CAGR of 19.7% over the past three fiscal years. Sell-side consensus is forecasting revenues to grow by 47.3% this fiscal year, reaching $24.6 billion. Over the past three fiscal years, NVDA's EBIT margin increased by 3.8% points from 37.0% to 40.8%. The margin expansion story is expected to accelerate. Street consensus is forecasting EBIT margin to expand by 500 basis points this fiscal year to 45.8%. Over the past three years, NVDA spent 7.1% of its revenue on share-based compensation (""SBC"") - not too bad for a company in hyper-growth mode. Over the same period, diluted outstanding common shares increased by 2.6%, so the impact of compensating employees with shares has been limited. As a result of the revenue, margin, and share dynamics, EPS grew at a CAGR of 29.5% over the past three fiscal years, outpacing its revenue growth. Going forward, consensus is forecasting EPS to increase by 58.8% to $15.88 this fiscal year. Financials for NVDA look great with a net cash position of $6.2 billion and a return on invested capital at a strong 22.7%. Trading and Valuation NVDA is currently trading at $713.01 per share, a market value of $444.2 billion, and an enterprise value of $438.0 billion. The stock's current dividend yield is 0.1%, which is a bit odd since nobody invests in NVDA for its dividend (the S&amp;P 500 is yielding around 1.3%). NVDA performed very well over the past year, returning 59% points more than the S&amp;P 500, or 102.9% in absolute return. The stock is trading 29.1% above its 200-day moving average and, over the past 52 weeks, has traded at a high of $717.57 and a low of $348.13 per share. Short interest is low at 1.0%, suggesting little skepticism of the company's fundamentals or valuation. Using consensus estimates for next fiscal year's results (FY2), NVDA is currently trading at an EV/Sales multiple of 16.2, an EV/EBIT multiple of 36.2, a P/E multiple of 41.3, and an FCF multiple of 46.2. Relative to the S&amp;P 500, NVDA is trading at an EV/Sales premium of 506.5%, an EV/EBIT premium of 99.0%, P/E premium of 107.4%, and FCF premium of 114.9%. With attractive growth rates and accelerating business momentum in massive markets, I believe these premiums are well justified. Takeaway  I'm not too worried about NVDA's crypto overhang, but I am excited about the ARM acquisition. The combined company would result in substantial revenue and strategic synergies and would be accretive to NVDA shareholders. Given NVDA's accelerating business momentum and pending close of the ARM acquisition, its premium valuation is still well justified.",2021-06-15

The May 19 crash produced a significant slump in the Bitcoin price. Since then, Bitcoin has been struggling to penetrate through the resistance of $40,000. However, with more regulations stepping up a gear in the crypto market, Bitcoin failed to achieve a real breakthrough.

From above, we can see that cryptocurrencies can go up and down at any time responding to various news. The crypto market is more volatile than many investors expected. While high volatility creates risks, it also brings considerable profits. Here, you need to know and grasp one of the most popular tradings in the crypto market. Leveraged Trading Leveraged trading enables you to maximize your profits with a small margin. Take 100X leverage as an example. While Bitcoin is trading at $10,000, if you use 1 BTC to open a long contract, your contract will worth 100 BTC. After a day,  you closed the position when the price reached $11,000. Your profit will be ($11,000-$10,000)*100BTC/$11,000=9.09BTC, and ROI (without transaction fees) will be 909%. Confronted with market volatility,  many traders, especially beginners and weak hands, appear to be at a loss. Thus, you need to find the right trading exchange.

While there had been previous grumblings about the energy needed to mine Bitcoin, Musk's tweet brought national attention to the issue. As a result, Bitcoin's value came crumbling down — and the expectations for cryptocurrencies changed instantly. With some popular coins' environmental footprints being as large as those of major cities, green coins are a much-needed solution. What makes Bitcoin so damaging?Estimates show that Bitcoin's network uses the same amount of energy in one year as the entire country of Argentina. While some argue that the majority of energy used for Bitcoin is tied to renewable sources, the exact amount has been disputed. One major caveat to the renewable-energy source argument is that 65 percent of people mining Bitcoin are living in China, where the majority of energy is generated from coal. Apart from the energy use, Bitcoin also generates massive amounts of e-waste: 11.5 kilotons to be exact.Related: Bill Gates Slams Bitcoin's Impact on Environment    Mining Bitcoin requires so much energy because of proof-of-work blockchains. Miners are rewarded for being the first to solve complex cryptographic puzzles using specialized computers, which require tons of power to work as hard and fast as they do. The system is believed to be better than centralized currency as it relies on no single trusted person or entity. One report found that 39.95 million tons of carbon-dioxide emissions can be attributed to Bitcoin mining each year.Are all cryptocurrencies bad for the environment?Some cryptocurrencies avoid the environmental issue altogether, as they do not use mining. These cryptocurrencies don't have the same energy drag, making them much better for the environment in comparison to Bitcoin. These coins are referred to as green coins.   Proof-of-stake blockchains are especially low-energy. Options like Cardano and EOS require no mining, so transactions can be processed with the same amount of energy that a regular computer network requires. To put that in perspective, Bitcoin uses 121 Terawatt-hours of electricity each year. Ethereum uses enough energy to power the nation of Qatar. Meanwhile, EOS has achieved carbon-neutral status.Though it's possible to move to a new consensus mechanism, it can be very difficult. Ethereum, for example, will likely transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain, but faces disputes from its miners. This means that large coins like Bitcoin and Ether will take time to solve their environmental issues — that means more energy is used while they figure it out. By investing in green cryptocurrency instead, you skip the wait.Related: Does Elon Musk Have a New Enemy? Binance CEO Taunts MuskFour green cryptocurrencies to invest in insteadWhile Bitcoin runs on proof-of-work, altcoins use proof-of-stake. In essence, a person can validate transactions based solely on how many coins they own — this is also referred to as their stake. Since this is done independently, these miners waste no energy. With that said, many of the green coins are altcoins, using proof-of-stake blockchain platforms.   1. Cardano is one of the most well-known, most successful green coins using the proof-of-stake blockchain. ADA coin has actually outperformed ETH and BTC since Musk's tweet as people rush to buy sustainable cryptocurrency.2. EOS uses a proof-of-stake platform and is the first major carbon-neutral blockchain. Carbon neutrality is EOS's calling card, and it's how it sets itself apart from the competition. Carbon emissions and carbon offset are listed clearly on the EOS website. In May of 2021, EOS contributed 281 tons of CO2 to the atmosphere over the last year — and also reached its goal of offsetting 281 tons.3. BitGreen, founded in direct response to Bitcoin's environmental impacts, uses an energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin's proof-of-work platform. BitGreen also encourages people to make more eco-friendly choices, like carpooling in apps like Uber and Lyft. They also provide incentives for volunteering and purchasing sustainable coffee.4. Stellar is seen as a viable alternative to PayPal, and its network can be used to exchange Bitcoin, U.S. dollars, pesos and most other traditional money and cryptocurrencies. Rather than a proof-of-stake or proof-of-work platform, Stellar operates on a consensus protocol. This method authenticates transactions through a set of secure nodes. This cycle is shorter and faster than the alternative, which is what allows the Stellar network (and its tokens, Lumens) to be considered green.   Related: El Salvador Makes History as the First Country to Accept BitcoinAlthough it's estimated that Bitcoin mining uses 55 percent to 65 percent renewable energy, there's still a long way to go for the leading cryptocurrency. Musk's tweet made us all ask important questions: Are all cryptocurrencies bad for the environment? Will we have to give up these revolutionary finance options? Luckily, there are much better options on the market, and with sustainable cryptocurrencies and green coins, crypto is here to stay.  ",2021-06-15

That's followed by long tech stocks, long ESG, short U.S. Treasuries and long euro.    Looking to the Fed, which starts its two-day meeting today, the majority expecting a tapering announcement by September at the latest. Jackson Hole in August is considered the most likely time for the FOMC to signal slowing bond purchases, with 38% expecting it to happen then. And 25% see an announcement coming at the September meeting.

According to TechRadar, solid-state drive sales are going to increase to an insane $51 billion by 2025, as predicted by tech watchdog International Data Corporation (IDC). That's the total expected revenue, which the IDC says comes from a massive increase in demand for solid-state drive storage, including businesses and end-users (ordinary folks).  (Photo : Olly Curtis/PC Gamer Magazine/Future via Getty Images) A group of solid-state drives, including Kingston, Intel, Samsung and Crucial brands, taken on November 16, 2016.  A ZDNet report reveals that the IDC predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8% for all Solid-State drive sales, with revenues increasing by an average of 9.2% every year until 2025. Furthermore, the IDC also says that SSD capacity shipments will experience an additional 33% CAGR for the next four years. This is good news, at least, especially for a lot of PC hardware enthusiasts who are feeling the negative effects of the current GPU and CPU shortage. Graphics cards and processors are selling for ridiculous prices; a bad reality that an SSD shortage would've compounded even more. Also, this is happening in the wake of a new cryptocurrency called Chia, which is mostly mined using an SSD. Read also: Which SSD is Better? SATA vs NVMe Solid-State Drive Popularity Increase: What's Causing It? An increase in SSD demand, whether it's an NVMe, PCIe, M.2, or SATA-based drive, makes many sense due to millions of people getting stuck at home during the pandemic. Many of them work from home and deal with a lot of data transfers (multimedia professionals like video editors and graphic artists, for instance) which more or less require fast storage. Aside from the workers, many gamers are also moving on from slower HDDs with the advent of next-gen gaming. Sony and Microsoft's next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles made it a point to focus a good amount of their marketing tactics on the systems' solid-state drive capacity, which they boasted could bring gamers from a cold boot to being in-game in mere seconds. Compared to last-generation consoles, the PS5 and Xbox Series X's loading times are night and day in terms of speed, all thanks to their custom SSD storage.  (Photo : Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Living room with Microsoft Xbox Series X (L) and Sony PlayStation 5 home video game consoles alongside a television and soundbar, taken on November 3, 2020. Will There Be an SSD Shortage?  Here's hoping that there won't be. It looks like solid-state drive manufacturers aren't being affected by the semiconductor shortage, at least not yet. An SSD doesn't really feature any high-powered processor, though they require other chips to function.  For now, solid-state drive supplies are staying steady despite the existence of Chia cryptocurrency mining. It did, however, briefly occur when Chia mining started gaining traction, but so far, it hasn't gone off the ground as fast as Ethereum or any other crypto, for that matter. Even companies such as GALAX warned Chia miners to not mine on their company's SSDs, or else they'd void the warranty.  The GPU and CPU shortage will end soon, so it's good that solid-state drive options remain relatively under control. Because when graphics card supplies eventually flood the market, that's where business starts kicking in again.  Related: Chia Mining Will DESTROY A 500GB SD in No Time, Miners Warned This article is owned by Tech Times Written by RJ Pierce                        ⓒ 2023 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

An estate plan — regardless of whether your assets are massive or meager — aims to ensure your wishes are carried out at death and to provide some guardrails for other end-of-life considerations. If you die without a will (called dying ""intestate""), the courts in your state decide who gets your assets. The process is public and can become messy if would-be heirs disagree over what should be rightfully theirs. And if your children are minors but you have no will or other document designating a guardian, the courts will decide who takes care of them, as well. Here are tips to consider for choosing the executor of your estate, as well as the individuals charged with powers of attorney for your finances and medical care before you die. The role of executor is a big job.This is the person in charge of everything from filing your will with the court to paying off your debts, closing accounts and making sure your remaining assets are distributed as specified in your will. (Be aware that some assets — such as retirement accounts and life insurance policies — are distributed based on the named beneficiary on the account, not what is stated in a will.)This means, for starters, that the person needs to be trustworthy and organized. They also need to be able to juggle the job with their other life responsibilities, Davis said.It takes nearly 16 months on average to settle an estate, according to online software provider estateexec.com. Those worth less than $10,000 settle more quickly (11 months on average), while estates worth more than $5 million take the longest to wrap up: 42 months (3.5 years). If you're thinking about naming co-executors, make sure they would be able to work together, Davis said. And be aware that the shared duties could make the process more complicated.""I usually recommend to clients that it's best to have one person in that role,"" Davis said. ""There would be just one signature required instead of two [on documents], which can take longer and sometimes become cumbersome.""It's also wise to ask the person before you finalize your will if they are willing to serve as executor.""You should discuss … your expectations,"" said certified financial planner Niv Persaud, founder of Transition Planning & Guidance in Atlanta. ""It's a lot of responsibility, and they may turn it down.""Even if they accept, it's worth naming a contingency executor (and getting that person's OK, as well) in case the situation changes.  If you create a trust as part of your estate plan and are choosing a trustee, the same general attributes should apply. And if you struggle to identify someone in your personal life to serve as an executor or trustee, you can rely on a professional like an attorney or accountant, or a trust company (or trust department at a bank).Married couples generally name each other as executor. In those cases, be sure to consider the backup person carefully.Also, executors are paid a modest fee based on state law (although some individuals choose not to receive pay), Davis said. In Oklahoma, for example, the fee starts at less than 1% of assets, depending on the size of the estate. It's worth drawing up two separate documents for powers of attorney: one for health-care decisions and the other for your finances. Many people end up naming separate individuals to serve in those roles. For the medical side, the person with the power-of-attorney designation can make important health-care decisions when you cannot. If you create what's called a living will — which states your wishes if you are on life support or suffer from a terminal condition — this can help guide your proxy's decision-making.As with naming an executor, you should first make sure the person would be comfortable in that position. You should also let them know your wishes in advance (i.e., a ""do not resuscitate"" order), Persaud said. For financial powers of attorney, the person should have the same general characteristics as the executor. This individual would be able to act on your behalf to handle your finances (i.e., paying bills or handling other money matters) if you cannot.""You can also decide how broad or specific the role will be,"" Persaud said. ""For example, [the person] could access your account to pay bills but not make investment decisions."" You generally should revisit your estate plan — even if it consists of only a will — every three to five years, said Davis of Hall Estill. If you experience a major life change before that (divorce, birth of child, major asset acquisition, etc.), it's worth reviewing sooner.Regardless of how often you check your plan, remember that over time, individuals' life situations — i.e., health or judgment — can change. So it's wise to confirm that each person is still up for the responsibility that you're expecting them to handle.""Make sure the people you named still make sense,"" Davis said.",2021-06-15

This is illustrative of the rising global trend of embracing cryptocurrencies with all its attendant risks. While not every country’s approach has been as open as El Salvador’s, the dominant theme has been to permit the growth of the cryptocurrency market subject to certain safeguards. As India finds itself at a crossroads of prohibition and regulation in its tryst with cryptocurrencies, globally, the inclination towards permissive regulation recognises the freedom of choice given to people for using a medium of exchange other than a central bank-backed fiat currency.Swinging between extremesThe cryptocurrency market in India has developed in a largely laissez-faire regulatory space since the first recorded cryptocurrency transaction in 2010. Between 2013 and 2018, the government’s response to the rise of virtual currencies was cautionary, alerting users to the potential risks posed by cryptocurrency transactions. These fears were legitimate and stemmed from cryptocurrencies’ volatility, their susceptibility to hacking, and the fact that they could potentially facilitate criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion. Instead of developing a regulatory framework to address these issues, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in April 2018, effectively imposed a ban on cryptocurrency trading. This ban was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2020. The court reasoned that there were alternative regulatory measures short of an outright ban through which the RBI could have achieved its objective of curbing the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading. While the court had an opportunity to put a label on the legal nature of cryptocurrencies, it stopped short of doing so.After swinging between the extremes of non-interference and prohibition, a clue as to India’s next move lies in the draft Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021. The draft Bill proposes to criminalise all private cryptocurrencies while also laying down the regulatory framework for an RBI-backed digital currency. The Minister of State for Finance, in response to a question in Parliament, stated that regulatory bodies do not have a legal framework to directly regulate private cryptocurrencies owing to their imprecise legal nature in India. As the draft Bill is yet to be tabled in Parliament, there is some hope that his concerns will be addressed in the form of a tailored regulatory approach rather than another ban.Lessons from other countriesThere are lessons in this regard from the U.K., Singapore and the U.S. The U.K. has classified cryptocurrency as property and this has paved the way for cryptocurrencies to be encompassed within a regulated legal framework in the country’s economy. The U.K. has sought to regulate the functioning of crypto-businesses while still imposing some restrictions to protect the interests of investors. On the other hand, while there is no exact legal classification of cryptocurrency in Singapore, the amenability of cryptocurrency transactions to the contract law framework of the country has been firmly established and there is now a legal framework for cryptocurrency trading. In the U.S., the open approach taken by the authorities has resulted in the trade in cryptocurrency being both taxed and appropriately regulated. While the approaches are specific to the countries’ economic realities and cannot be blindly implemented in India, the global regulatory attitude towards cryptocurrencies offers valuable insights into the alternative ways to achieve balanced regulation. In India, the absence of an existing legal classification of cryptocurrency should not be the impetus to prohibit its use. The government should use this as an opportunity to allow private individuals the freedom to harness a powerful new technology with appropriate regulatory standards.

But thanks to having the keys, two cybersecurity experts were able to release a free decryptor for all victims of Avaddon, which first appeared in March 2020. ""We call on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders and hold those networks accountable for their  actions."" ""Fear"" likely drove Avaddon's claimed retirement, according to a new report from New York-based threat intelligence firm Advanced Intelligence. Based on chatter happening on Russian-language cybercrime forums, AdvIntel's Vitali Kremez and Yelisey Boguslavskiy write in the report that ""Avaddon's demise was likely caused by political reasons - a sharp reaction of the U.S. presidential administration on the recent ransomware attacks, and the subsequent pressure applied by Russian law enforcement against local cybercrime groups prior to the upcoming Biden-Putin summit."" That summit is set to start in Geneva on Wednesday, and ransomware is very much on the agenda, as it was in the meeting of leading industrial nations that ran from Friday to Sunday in England. That Group of Seven meeting ended with a unanimous declaration from the governments of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States that the UN must enforce norms for responsible international cybersecurity behavior. ""We also commit to work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks,"" the G-7 declaration states. ""We call on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders and hold those networks accountable for their actions."" Dear President Putin Just in case Moscow didn’t get the message, the G-7 declaration calls on Russia to stop trying to destabilize Western democracies, to cease launching chemical weapons attacks - including against its own citizens - and also ""to identify, disrupt and hold to account those within its borders who conduct ransomware attacks, abuse virtual currency to launder ransoms and other cybercrimes."" In other words, ransomware now joins election interference and chemical weapons on leading nations' list of Russia's most egregious offenses. Since the Colonial Pipeline and JBS attacks, the White House has also been urging U.S. organizations to take ransomware attacks more seriously - treating them not as data-loss events but potentially business-ending ones. The Department of Justice has also launched a Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, giving those crimes the same level of attention as terrorism. Ransomware Realpolitik Life comes at you fast, especially if you're running a ransomware business. Such organizations occasionally operate as a single organization, as the now-defunct Maze appeared to be run, handling in-house everything from malware development to attacks and shakedowns. But what's more prevalent today are ransomware-as-a-service - aka RaaS - operations, in which affiliates, who may work with multiple operations, effectively lease access to a ransomware portal. Maintained by the operator, the portal gives affiliates the ability to generate that operation's malicious crypto-locking malware executable, such as Avaddon. The affiliate takes the malware and infects victims. Every time a victim pays, the operator keeps its cut - 30% or less for Avaddon, AdvIntel says - and routes the rest of the cryptocurrency to the affiliate.   A look at the 10 sectors most targeted by RaaS operations from Jan. 1 to May 4, with Avaddon shown in bright purple (Source: Advanced Intelligence) This approach, which has helped drive sky-high ransomware profits, functions as the equivalent of a cloud service for anyone who wants to wield ransomware, with operators keeping their cut. Specialization helps all the criminals win. Or at least it did, until the Colonial Pipeline Co. attack, which disrupted systems tied to the supply of 45% of the U.S. East Coast's fuel. Now, the U.S. and allies are now treating ransomware not as a nuisance but a national security threat. Ransomware operators have been seeing the writing on the wall. Shortly after the Colonial Pipeline hit by a DarkSide affiliate, its operator claimed that affiliates would no longer be allowed to attack those types of targets. Shortly thereafter, DarkSide announced that it would no longer work with affiliates. Another RaaS operation called Babuk, which had hit the metropolitan police department of Washington, D.C., announced that it was handing its source code off to another party. Similarly, RaaS giant REvil - aka Sodinokibi - and Avaddon issued identical statements, announcing that affiliates were prohibited from attacking any of the Commonwealth of Independent States - which includes Russia and former Soviet countries - according to threat intelligence firm Intel 471 and others. Attacking any organization ""in the public sector, healthcare, educational institutions, charitable organizations"" would also be prohibited, and the operators said that ""before processing the target,"" final approval was required from an administrator of the RaaS program. (It's not clear exactly what is meant by ""processing"".)   Avaddon's statement, issued in mid-May (Source: John Fokker, head of cyber investigations and principal engineer at McAfee) Some cybercrime forums - notably Russian-language giant XSS - have also announced restrictions on ransomware, although those may be empty promises. Intel 471 says some other supporting cybercrime ecosystem services also claimed to have shuttered, including BitMix - a cryptocurrency mixing service designed to make it more difficult to ""follow the money"" that was used by Avaddon, DarkSide and REvil. Market Forces In recent weeks, experts say, Avaddon appeared to be increasing its attack efforts in what now looks like an attempt to exit, if not in a blaze of glory, then at least profitability. ""Avaddon was tied with Conti for most number of ransomware extortions published since the Colonial Pipeline attack,"" totaling 59 new victims, says Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at threat intelligence firm Recorded Future who specializes in tracking ransomware activity. Avaddon was making money hand over fist. AdvIntel, based on its analysis of victims and ransoms paid, offers a ""ransonomics"" estimate that Avaddon's operators - who routed about 70% of every ransom payment to the responsible affiliate, and kept the rest - earned $26 million, which it says was likely divided between at least four operators, meaning they each earned nearly $7 million over its approximately yearlong run. The annual revenue of Avaddon's victims (Source: Advanced Intelligence) ""To compare: the median annual income in Russia is estimated to be $7,000,"" AdvIntel's Kremez and Boguslavskiy write. ""In other words, in one year of ransomware development, an Avaddon member made the same amount of money as an average Russian would make in a millennium - the best illustration of how lucrative ransomware could be for the region."" Market forces have now driven DarkSide, Avaddon and others to seek a lower profile. But will their operators really exit the ransomware life, or might they lay low and rebrand, pending whatever action Putin may take? ""A number of the operators will most likely operate in their own closed-knit groups, resurfacing under new names and updated ransomware variants,"" Intel 471 says. With millions of dollars of further potential profits on offer, my money is on them waiting for the right moment to return. ",2021-06-15

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewAccording to Simon Peters, an analyst at eToro:“Bitcoin is at its highest level since May, a notable recovery but the crypto asset has yet to convincingly break through - and most importantly, close above - the $41,000 mark. While sentiment has improved and futures premiums have recovered after nearly entering backwardation last week, analysts are unable to confirm that the bull trend has resumed. Peters said: “We've seen the price face resistance earlier in the year at this level when it was trading around what was then an all-time high, and I would really need to see a stronger increase to feel optimistic about the price recovering and possibly pushing onto $50,000 and beyond.”Sentiment has improved but the market is flatDeribit Bitcoin options 25% delta skew. Source: laevitas.chRegarding the lack of follow-through from Bitcoin’s June 14 pump, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman shared the above chart and said that while the 25% delta skew is no longer signaling that extreme fear exists in the market. Pechman said:“Arbitrage desks and market markers are currently uncomfortable with Bitcoin’s price as the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher. However, the current 7% positive skew is far from the 20% exaggerated fear seen in late May.”Even though day traders are on the fence about the status of the trend, a number of on-chain metrics, including the Hodler Net Position Change, show that investors still view the recent dip to $30,000 and Bitcoin’s current price at $40,250 as excellent purchasing opportunities.

The government’s amongst the most corrupt in the world, as Bitcoinist previously reported. In the past, national regulators tried to ban Bitcoin and all transactions related to the cryptocurrency, but the measure was reverted when the local currency plummeted in its BTC trading pair. Arcane Research concluded that this country’s policies are hostile towards Bitcoin. In the short and mid-term, this seems unlikely to change. The Nigerian government is apparently looking for alternatives in a central bank digital currency (CBDC). According to a report by the news website Today, authorities will launch a digital currency by December 2021. Rakiya Mohammed, Director for Information and Technology for Nigeria, said the following: The digital currency would be accessible to all Nigerians. Just like everybody has access to cash, everybody will have access to the central bank’s digital currency. Let me state categorically that cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and the rest of them are not under the control of the central bank; they are purely private decisions that individuals make. This move could put further pressure on the private sector to dropped BTC for the government-backed CBDC. As many experts have pointed out, these digital assets are the opposite of Bitcoin and could be implemented to detriment of the population’s privacy. In this case, the people will truly decide. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $40,399 with sideways movement in the past day. Higher timeframes record profits, as BTC makes a push towards resistance levels.

XPR holders have themselves been holding on while they wait for an indication that the SEC’s case against Ripple is nearing a conclusion. But, according to a tweet by attorney James K Filan, the wait might be a bit longer. Filan shared the news that the SEC’s request to extend the discovery period of the investigation by 60 days has been granted.Despite this, a number of other SEC motions were denied in what many consider a weak case against Ripple overall. Motions denied by the Judge include the SEC’s request for documents post-dating the complaint and documents from General Consul and Deputy Consul.Filan followed up the announcement with another post, declaring this a win for Ripple despite the extension. “This is a good sign for the fair notice defense. Judge Netburn has made clear to the SEC yet again that the focus of that defense is on the activities of the SEC and not on Ripple.” Attorney Jeremy Hogan said that he believes the extra two months extension will push this case into 2022. He adds that a settlement is still on the table, but that outcome is unlikely at this stage.The SEC’s case against RippleIn the lawsuit, the SEC alleges that XRP is not a currency and is, in fact, a security. Due to this, the SEC alleges that a pair of executives sold $1.3 billion in unregistered securities. Part of Ripple’s defense is that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum is a security according to the SEC due to their decentralized nature. Ripple argues they are being treated differently than their peers for operating in the same space.Ripple has been trying to get answers and information as to why the SEC is not targeting BTC and ETH as well. Ripple claims they never held an ICO and denies any offering of securities, or that it engaged in a single offering of XRP. The court record shows that Ripple claims it has “never held an ICO, never offered future tokens to raise money, and has no contracts with the vast majority of XRP holders.”Meanwhile, the SEC is under the belief that the development and distribution of XRP were done by Ripple in a centralized manner. The SEC not only has charged Ripple Labs, but also co-founders Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen with conducting the $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering for selling XRP for the last eight years.",2021-06-15

She doesn’t like the impact Elon Musk has recently had on markets, and fears what might happen if governments come in and regulate the industry. “…I still think for the long run … it’s a place to put some money and just leave it, but not a lot.” For other skeptics worried about Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, she recommends crypto exposure alternatives such as MicroStrategy, or Square Inc. who both have disclosed corporate BTC purchases. She also warns to only invest money you can stand to lose. “There are other ways to play it other than just simply buying the crypto itself,” Orman said. For anyone who doubts Orman’s skills due to the demographic disconnect – don’t. Orman recently bought MSTR shares at $125 and later sold the shares for over $1,000 for nearly a 10x.

Bitcoin grows by word of mouth and network effect, and with Orman involved, the cryptocurrency just got an extremely vocal and valuable cheerleader who can reach outside the millennial demographic which already likes bitcoin anyway.

The presence of automated processes is evident in every aspect of building a product or service from scratch. Its significance is heavily felt in manufacturing, quality checks, and even increasing the efficiency and efficacy of sales and marketing. According to market estimates, the automation industry is generating around 214 billion US dollars worldwide in 2021. The automation of digital processes is also expected to witness a double-digit growth rate between 2018 and 2023. Market research estimates predict that the market for digital process automation will reach USD 12.61 billion, at a CAGR of 13.3%, from a figure of $6.77 billion in 2018. Automation in the World of Crypto The world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain has also welcomed automation. Automated crypto trading allows users to execute trades without them having to keep constant track of the market. Based on the strategy you rely upon, the system will execute trades on your behalf, pivoting on that one factor you have chosen from a set of plausible factors. These factors may include the price of the crypto asset, the proportion of value in your portfolio, or any other technical indicator.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  If you are keen to leverage the massive growth potential the crypto market presents but do not have enough time to invest, automated cryptocurrency platforms are your best option.

All these reasons have their tangible impact on improving a trader’s bottom line, especially of one who is new or does not have rough time and resources to research. Here, we would have a look at some of the most crucial of these benefits.  Optimized Entry into the Market: Being a rapidly evolving market, the world of cryptocurrency is highly volatile. The price fluctuations are much higher compared to what any other asset trading market witnesses daily. Earning profits from such a volatile market requires extensive research and prior experience in dealing with these assets. Automated trading platforms help to even out such a market that is, otherwise, highly rewarding towards experience and full-time involvement. Platforms like Terablock, with its machine-learning-driven strategies, help novice traders locate the exact time of entry so that they could save days and weeks of time and resources to ascertain an optimum one. In short, an automated trading platform is a perfect launchpad for any new trader with the minimum volume of risk involved. Follow the Best in the Market: Several automated trading platforms let new entrants copy the trading strategies of experienced traders. While experience is not alone sufficient to make someone fully immune to the risks of a market, there are several approaches that a newbie can learn from these experienced traders to minimize the major investment risks – risks that could cost them their entire initial investment. Diversification: In any market, diversification of trading strategies and assets is paramount to reduce risk. While manual trading requires time to execute a trade and focus on one particular strategy at a time, automated trading strategies allow users to trade multiple accounts or strategies simultaneously. The index trade automation feature of Terablock, for instance, helps select four top-performing indexes at once based on their total market cap, asset performance, project overview, and other relevant statistical data. It is simple to use with a one-click set-up, and it acts fast whenever the market starts making corrections. Since it monitors the market 24/7, it can execute trades as &amp; when there is a favorable change in the market conditions. Preserving Discipline and Reducing Emotions: Since automated trade executions, once deployed, follows a disciplined regime, it negates the scope of emotions taking over a trader’s decision. A trader may fluctuate on his/her strategies depending on the emotional state they are in at that moment. In a market that is on a downward slope, traders may dwindle with their strategies driven by the fear of losing funds. On the other hand, in a market that is on an ascension slope, traders may make wrong decisions in the hope of making extra profits than initially estimated. Automated trading saves from such contingencies, which may hurt the trade. Improving Speed and Monitoring Capabilities: Platforms like Terablock help prepare portfolios with a few clicks. The trading bots are quick in responding to the changing market conditions. It generates trades almost instantaneously as soon as the trading rules are met. It also acts fast in entering and exiting the market. 24/7 monitoring of the market helps capture the exact moment of entry or exit. It is not highly difficult for a trader, working manually, to capture these points with utmost accuracy.  Overall, automated crypto trading invariably results in efficiency and improvement of the bottom line. It is the reason why tools like TeraBlock can generate an annualized return of more than 300% on their portfolio.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                    Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay ",2021-06-15

By Matthew Smith - Jun 15, 2021, 1:00 PM CDTAfter a devastating 2020 strife-torn Colombia has been … [+6653 chars]",OilPrice.com,"After a devastating 2020 strife-torn Colombia has been rocked by widespread anti-government protests which were sparked at the end of April 2021 by President Duque’s proposed tax reform. Authorities’ heavy-handed repression of the protests which sees 77 dead, with 40 of those at the hands of police and security agencies according to think tank Indepaz, sparked a series of road blockades across Colombia. Those have prevented onshore oil companies from resupplying their operations and transporting petroleum by road, forcing many to shutter production. The regions among the worst affected are the Putumayo and Middle Magdalena Valley Basins, forcing Colombia’s fifth-largest oil producer Gran Tierra Energy to shut-in 5,250 barrels of oil production. This is because most of the driller’s developed oil reserves and producing fields are in those two basins. The overall impact of the protests and related blockades on Colombia’s economically vital oil industry has been severe. Colombia’s energy minister Diego Mesa released data showing that national oil production fell below 700,000 barrels per day during May 2021, the first time since 2009 when national oil output averaged 670,526 barrels per day. Mesa went on to claim the blockades had forced up to 48,000 barrels of daily oil production offline and cost the combined energy and mining sectors over $69 million. Regardless of those events, Mesa believes that Colombia will still pump on average 780,000 to 800,000 barrels per day during 2021, although that is dependent on the blockades being lifted. It is worth noting that the forecast is well above the daily average of 745,305 barrels pumped for the first four months of the year, meaning it likely will not be achieved unless there is a significant lift in production during the second half of 2021.Despite signs that the anti-government protests are easing, boding well for Colombia’s economically vital energy sector, there is still considerable uncertainty. The national strike committee, which is composed of 27 different organizations including unions, student and civil society groups has failed to reach a concrete agreement with the national government. This is in part due to the Duque administration’s unwillingness to negotiate unless the roadblocks are lifted but also because of the different agendas of the groups comprising the coalition, which lacks the ability to compel protestors to lift blockades. In many regions, notably the departments of Meta, Cauca, and Putumayo, the blockades are being driven by long-standing local grievances concerning violence and lack of access to vital economic resources. The petroleum industry in many of those areas is also facing a crisis with its social license deteriorating because of the push to introduce hydraulic fracturing and local environmental damage caused by oil extraction. That is particularly notable in Puerto Gaitan where oilfields were subject to violent invasions before Colombia’s national protests commenced. Nonetheless, according to Colombia’s defense ministry, there were only 18 active blockades (Spanish) as of Friday last week compared to well over 2,000 at the peak. That bodes well for the ongoing reactivation of the crucial energy sector.    Related: How An Oil Pipeline Hack Sent Bitcoin Prices TumblingRegardless of the protests and failure to reach a negotiated outcome with the strike committee, which would bring them to an end, Colombia’s energy ministry is pressing ahead with reactivating the energy sector. This saw the ministry announce, last week, (Spanish) the launch of Colombia’s hydrocarbon round 2021. Colombia’s hydrocarbon regulator the National Hydrocarbon Agency (ANH – Spanish initials) is offering 32 blocks to energy investors with four nominated by energy companies and the remaining 28 offered by the agency. The ANH’s 28 blocks are composed of five onshore blocks in the Lower, Middle and Upper Magdalena Valley as well as the Llanos Basins and 23 offshore blocks in the Urabá, Sinú - San Jacinto, Chocó Continental, Chocó Offshore and Tumaco Basins.   Source: ANH.Public hearings for offers and counteroffers for the blocks being offered will be held in November and December with contracts to be signed during the last month of 2021.   This is an important development for Colombia because the reactivation of the hydrocarbon sector is key to rebuilding an economy shattered by the pandemic, which shrank nearly 7% during 2020. Bogota is focused on expanding investment in the oil industry with higher foreign direct investment and oil production important drivers of fiscal revenue as well as GDP. This is particularly important because Colombia’s economy is dependent on hydrocarbon production to grow yet possesses very meager oil and natural gas reserves. For 2020, which was an abnormal year due to the pandemic and oil price crash, petroleum was still responsible for 17% of government income, 3% of GDP, and 28% of exports by value. Prior to the August 2014, oil price crash petroleum generated more than a fifth of Colombia’s fiscal revenue, 55% of exports by value, and nearly 5% of GDP. During 2013, the Andean country’s GDP grew by an impressive 5.1%, which was primarily due to growing oil production, which for the first time ever broke through the million barrels per day mark to average 1,008,178 barrels daily. Those numbers underscore just how important the exploitation of hydrocarbons has become for Colombia’s economy.Despite being a major oil producer in Latin America, the region’s third-largest, Colombia does not possess significant crude oil reserves. The oil-dependent country’s energy ministry stated earlier this month that by the end of 2020 Colombia had proved oil reserves totaling 1.8 billion barrels, an 11% decrease compared to a year earlier, and 2.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas an almost 7% year over year decline. Those proved oil reserves will only last for just over six years at current production levels, which are 16% lower than 2019 and nearly eight years for natural gas despite current output is 1% less than 2019. These numbers demonstrate that Colombia urgently needs to make major hydrocarbon discoveries and rapidly expand its proved reserves if it is to avert an economic crisis. Unless that occurs, or Colombia rapidly reduces its economic dependence on oil production, it is facing a near-term economic crisis when those limited hydrocarbon reserves are drained. That would be a catastrophic event for a country riven by political turmoil, poverty, and corruption, which was once regarded as one of the best-performing economies in Latin America.By Matthew Smith for Oilprice.com ADVERTISEMENT      More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Markets Baffled As The IEA Calls For More ProductionGoldman Sachs Doubles Down On $80 Oil PredictionMiddle East Oil Prices Rise As Global Demand Recovers  ",2021-06-15

The poll covers a gamut of investor issues, from where the economy and markets are heading to how much cash portfolio managers are holding and which trades they see as most overdone. On that last point, investors view commodities as the most-crowded trade, replacing last month's leader, bitcoin. Commodities generally attract big cash when inflation fears are running high, and the most recent readings have shown peaks not seen in well over a decade.The most recent indication came Tuesday, when prices on products and services that companies use rose 6.6% over the past year, the biggest gain since the Labor Department started keeping track in August 2010.Even though investors largely agree with the Fed's characterization that the inflation burst will pass, they still see the central bank soon taking the first steps to tightening policy.Respondents see the Fed likely to begin talk of tapering its $120 billion of monthly bond purchases in the coming months. Sixty-three percent expect a signal in August or September, with 38% seeing it coming at the annual Jackson Hole summit in August and 25% expecting it to start at the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting.The move to reduce bond purchases, however anticipated, could generate a negative market reaction. Survey respondents rated a taper tantrum in the bond market — that is, a sharp uptick in yields — as the biggest ""tail risk,"" or unlikely event that could cause substantial damage. Bond yields move inversely to prices.Investors generally see the market rally continuing. In fact, they've cut cash levels down to 3.9%, which Bank of America says is a contrarian ""sell"" signal.

Texas is an ideal destination for miners, thanks to its abundance of solar and wind power, its unregulated market, and its crypto-friendly political stance. China has long been home to more than half the world's bitcoin miners, but now, Beijing wants them out ASAP. In May, the government called for a severe crackdown on bitcoin mining and trading, setting off what's being dubbed in crypto circles as ""the great mining migration."" This exodus is underway now, and it could be a game changer for Texas.Mining is the energy-intensive process which both creates new coins and maintains a log of all transactions of existing digital tokens. Despite a lack of reserves that caused dayslong blackouts last winter, Texas often has some of the world's lowest energy prices, and its share of renewables is growing over time, with 20% of its power coming from wind as of 2019. It has a deregulated power grid that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are very pro-crypto – dream conditions for a miner looking for a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.""You are going to see a dramatic shift over the next few months,"" said Brandon Arvanaghi, previously a security engineer at crypto exchange Gemini. ""We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible."" 2021 data for the global distribution of mining power is not yet available, but past estimates have shown that 65% to 75% of the world's bitcoin mining happened in China – mostly in four Chinese provinces: Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan. Sichuan and Yunnan's hydropower make them renewable energy meccas, while Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are home to many of China's coal plants. The drawdown in miners has already begun in Inner Mongolia. After failing to meet Beijing's climate targets, province leaders decided to give bitcoin miners two months to clear out, explicitly blaming its energy misses on crypto mines. Castle Island Ventures founding partner Nic Carter says that while it's not totally clear how China will handle next steps, a phased rollout is likely. ""It seems like we're going from policy statement to actual implementation in relatively short order,"" he said.

""So we're trying to diversify our global mining hashrate, and that's why we are moving to the United States and to Canada.""One of bitcoin's greatest features is that it is totally location agnostic. Miners only require an internet connection, unlike other industries that must be relatively close to their end users. ""The cool thing about bitcoin that is underappreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it's a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,"" said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.That said, the exodus won't be instantaneous, in part, because it will take miners some time to either move their machines out of China or liquidate their assets and set up shop elsewhere.  Because miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, they are incentivized to migrate to the world's cheapest sources of power. ""Every Western mining host I know has had their phones ringing off the hook,"" said Carter. ""Chinese miners or miners that were domiciled in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the U.S. and Northern Europe.""One likely destination is China's next-door neighbor, Kazakhstan. The country's coal mines provide a cheap and abundant energy supply. It also helps that Kazakhstan has a more lax attitude about building, which bodes well for miners who need to construct physical installations in a short period of time.  Didar Bekbauov runs Xive, a company that provides hosting services to international miners. Xive also sells the specialized equipment needed for mining. Bekbauov says that he's stopped counting the number of Chinese miners who have called him to ask about relocation options, ranging from operations with 15 rigs to thousands. ""One miner told us that only government electricity plants have restricted mining and private ones will continue to service miners,"" Bekbauov told CNBC. ""But most of the electricity is generated by government power plants, so miners will have to move. That makes them uncertain and desperate to find other locations,"" he said.Whether Kazakhstan is a destination or simply a stopover on a longer migration west remains to be seen. Arvanaghi is bullish on North America and thinks the hashrate there will grow over the next few months.""Texas not only has the cheapest electricity in the U.S. but some of the cheapest in the globe,"" he said. ""It's also very easy to start up a mining company ... if you have $30 million, $40 million, you can be a premier miner in the United States.""

EV companies fighting to winChina's AI applications are coming — where it matters for monetization Wyoming has also trended toward being pro-bitcoin and could be another mining destination, according to Arvanaghi.There are, however, a few major limitations to the U.S. becoming a global mining destination.For one, the lead time to build the actual physical infrastructure necessary to host miners is likely six to nine months, Carter told CNBC. ""The U.S. probably can't be as nimble as other countries in terms of onshoring these stray miners,"" he said.The move logistics may also prove difficult. There is a shipping container shortage, thanks to the tail winds of the Covid pandemic. But perhaps the biggest question is the reliability of the Texas power grid. A storm that devastated large swaths of the state in 2021 has reignited a debate over whether Texas should winter-proof its systems, a potentially costly project that might affect taxes or other fees for those looking to tap into the state's power grid. More recently, ERCOT, the organization that operates Texas' grid, asked consumers to conserve energy amid what officials called an unusual number of ""forced generation outages"" and an upcoming heat wave. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bashed bitcoin mining, claiming that it is bad for the environment. It's not a new criticism.For years, skeptics have maligned the world's most popular digital token for polluting the planet, while supporters have extolled the virtues of bitcoin and its role in accelerating the rise of renewable energy. It is unclear whether the China mining exodus will make or break the case for bitcoin enthusiasts in the debate around the token's carbon footprint. The dominant narrative, to date, has been that much of the world's bitcoin is mined with Chinese goal. ""From a narrative perspective, it's definitely an improvement,"" said Carter. ""But China also has the most abundant stranded hydro resources in the world.""The country offers significant energy vectors from wind, solar and especially hydropower in the south. Xinjiang's grid, for example, is 35% powered by wind and solar energy inputs.If all the miners do end up leaving China, it will mean less fossil fuel-powered mining, but it will also mean that the network's share of renewable energy-powered mining will drop. This is why the question of where these migrant miners end up could prove critical to bitcoin's future. ""It's the biggest story of the year for bitcoin,"" said Carter. De La Torre says they're looking to expand operations using green energy, a trend that is already years in the making. He says that hydro plants are generally cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world.""Mining is price sensitive, so as to seek out the lowest cost power and the lowest cost power tends to be renewable because if you're burning fossil fuels...it has extraction, refinement and transport costs,"" explained Blockstream CEO Adam Back.  Each year, investment bank Lazard releases a breakdown of energy costs by source. Its 2020 report shows that many of the most common renewable energy sources are either equal to or less expensive than conventional energy sources like coal and gas. And the cost of renewable power keeps going down.But there are limitations to running crypto mines purely on renewable energy.Though solar and wind are now the world's least expensive energy sources, both power supplies face limitations at scale, so there is concern over the viability of miners turning exclusively to wind or solar energy. For the time being, there isn't that much mining capacity worldwide that is ready to absorb the Chinese miner diaspora. While they scramble to find a new home, we could see hashrate go offline – and stay offline. In practice, that would mean all the remaining miners are more profitable for a period of time. Having more geographic dispersion would even out the global balance of power, and it would also reduce the ability of any one sovereign nation to co-opt or control the network.We may also see special crypto economic zones pop up in the next few months.""You will see jurisdictions adopting a very favorable stance and creating the equivalent of special zones to encourage miners to host locally,"" said Carter. ""We're seeing it at the state level here. You're also going to see it at the country level, you might even see subsidized electricity for mining.""

The cryptocurrency industry has been built by the community of freedom-loving, tech-savvy people who wanted to make a tremendous impact on payments since the inception of the banking system. And they nailed it. Blockchain implementation made it possible to initiate advancements even beyond traditional finance, and many global companies benefit from it for their operations. After the decade of development, filled with hopes, despair, and the emergence of new directions, the world has been divided into two camps. One always struggled for freedom while another party was high on appreciation of what has become known to some as a watchdog regime. How can one acquire the most precise and truthful evaluation? Let’s analyze the pros and cons of regulations to realize the whole picture.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  The Binary World Back in the times immemorial, when Bitcoin was some questionable joke alike invention, people used by thousands to buy a few slices of pizza or even purchase a used car, no one thought it might ever grow in a trillion-worth industry. Well, things are different now. Early adopters became billionaires, later ones – millionaires, and even casual investors enjoyed skyrocketing returns on investments as even stimulus checks from 2020 made some people rich. And we know well – where’s the money, there’s a fraud and a set of laws to protect people from it. Last month, when BTC hit its new record, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC that the regulation is one of the biggest threats to crypto. The chief executive of Coinbase explained that with the advent of the Internet, many countries also feared its development and tried to control the flow of information. China has gone very far in this regard, still trying to supervise the Internet to the best of its ability.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  In fact, cryptocurrencies have spawned a new industry direction in the financial markets. Back in 2017, the capitalization of the global securities market peaked at $ 40 trillion. Thanks to the advent of computers and the Internet, capitalization in this area has increased significantly over 15 years, showing 10x growth! The rising star of Bitcoin helped to popularize these assets among a wide audience. Among the first cryptocurrency exchanges was the Kraken exchange, founded in 2011 in San Francisco. Earlier in 2011, Mt. Gox (Mount Gox), a giant player of that time, began to operate with a share close to half of the volume of transactions in the Bitcoin network. Cryptocurrency exchanges differ in their principles from stock exchanges, but they have the same essence – providing services for trading assets. Today, the stock exchanges are superior to cryptocurrency platforms when it comes to insurance of investor accounts and brokerage companies. However, when compared to the stock market and forex, cryptocurrency exchanges have an undeniable advantage in the form of access to data, high volatility, and easy accessibility to trading. However, since such exchanges are not regulated in any way when making a deposit, there is a risk of its complete loss!     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Companies registered in the European Union or the United States provide insurance of customer deposits for tens of thousands of dollars in the event of bankruptcy of the organization and other unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, the state, not the company, is responsible for the safety of funds. Cryptocurrency exchanges cannot offer this so far. Hacker attacks, unscrupulous employees, and rug pulls are problems that have arisen before, and the risk still remains at large. The examples of downfall are countless when it comes to funding losses in the crypto field. Mount Gox and Quadriga CX are just the tips of this iceberg of fallen investor’s expectations. At the same time, in the absence of regulation, becoming a client of such an exchange is possible simply by having only an email. To trade in the stock market or forex, one will be required to confirm his identity and place of residence by providing several documents. Naturally, government regulators must comply with such procedures, which to some extent creates an inconvenience. The profession of a trader is full of risks that a trader tries to minimize losses if trading is his main source of income. Therefore, it is unlikely that investors will actively invest in a new area before providing guarantees. Volatility is still on the side of cryptocurrencies. Every day, new coins show up on the market and experience a level of growth that did not exist at all in the stock market or forex. The token market has weak liquidity compared to the stock market and forex, where capitalization is measured in trillions of dollars, which is ten times higher than the capitalization of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, as long as there is no such regulation in this market, liquidity, accordingly, will be at a low level, which will allow the price to make sharp jumps.  Staying on the side of right The cryptocurrency sector is booming globally, but acceptance and regulation are different in the parts of the world. Why is it crucial for the EU to have the regulation for crypto on the supranational level? There is no denying that European Union is very strict and conservative to innovations. Some views, such as expressed by the head of the Eurobank Christine Lagarde, mentioning that ECB won’t issue Digital Euro in less than five years, prove that the state is lagging in cryptocurrency adoption. On the other hand, fraudsters have fewer chances for their illicit schemes to operate and fool the clients. By shaping new AMLD frameworks every few years, the EU watchdogs aim to make the continent the safest harbor for digital asset clients. One of the most successful players in the EU league is currently STEX, a fully compliant spot crypto exchange supporting all European AML standards. This platform offers convenient solutions and extensive trading pairs to provide an unmatched trading experience. STEX is currently supporting more than 400 different cryptocurrencies and users can buy digital assets using Visa and MasterCard and SEPA, Bancontact iDEAL payment systems. The platform operates under the license of the Estonian regulator and complies with KYC / AML procedures. “The world has seen way too many examples of extremely devastating activity on unregulated platforms. Emerging industry required regulation in order to mature and attract more clients: mainstream user along with financial heavyweights will be more eager to step in knowing that their funds and privacy is better protected ”, – the CEO and platforms founder Vadym Kurylovych stated commenting on the development of legal frameworks in the EU. VK also warns that due to the fact that many exchanges are not regulated in any way when making a deposit, there is a risk of its complete loss, while there is no insurance. The last examples of the crypto world hurdles perfectly show that there is less room for cybercriminals in the modern world. The importance of regulations will grow since this activity is aimed to shelter clients from various growing cases of fraud. Everybody wants safety when it comes to the critical point and there’s only one way to achieve that. No matter what, the industry’s fines have already chosen their way, and no other variants will appear over time. Do your best for yourself and make the right choice. Stay on the side of light.   ",2021-06-15

Fresh off the heels of selling $500M worth of privately offered notes in a securities offering this week, the leading business analytics firm is looking for more. Stock Offering MicroStrategy is rapidly approaching 100K worth of BTC in the firm’s Bitcoin-holding subsidiary, MacroStrategy LLC. The recent common stock offering for the company suggests that they could be looking to cross the 100K threshold sooner rather than later. This week’s SEC filing will enable MicroStrategy to sell up to $1B worth of their class A common stock $MSTR over time; in the SEC prospectus, the firm stated that they “intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any class A common stock offered under this prospectus for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement.”                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  Of course, with over 92K BTC in the newly-formed subsidiary’s account, MicroStrategy could already cross the 100K mark even with just the recent bond offering. At current pricing, the company could secure over 10K bitcoin with the money raised from the senior secured note sales, making the common stock announcement just icing on the cake for the MacroStrategy BTC holdings. Even with the firm’s current numbers alone, they are far and away the corporate leader when it comes to BTC holdings, with over twice as much BTC on hand than Tesla.

The company to-date has looked at their operations as a two-pronged business, growing their enterprise analytics software business and acquiring and holding bitcoin. MicroStrategy stock has responded positively to the recent fundraising with the firm’s sentiment focused on buying more bitcoin.

A survey found that Global hedge fund managers expect to invest an average of 7.2% of their assets in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by 2026. In this photo, a Bitcoin ATM is seen inside the Big Apple Tobacco Shop on February 08, 2021 in New York City.  Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap and therefore receives most of the news coverage.But hedge funds are also likely to invest in Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap and key to the development of decentralized finance—blockchain-based transactions between individuals that don't rely on financial intermediaries such as banks, brokerages or exchanges.In a research report, the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank said Ethereum is better suited for commerce than Bitcoin.Interest in cryptos by top money managers underscores Bitcoin's growth as an asset class. Many institutional investors use it as an inflation hedge, fearing that massive government spending worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to inflation.The planned investments are also a vote of confidence in Bitcoin. Critics say Bitcoin is too volatile to serve as a store of value or to use in commerce.The cryptocurrency rose from about $29,000 at the end of 2020 to more than $63,000 in April. It lost as much as half its value in the recent downturn but has rallied and now trades at about $40,000.The number of Bitcoin worldwide is limited to 21 million and there are now about 18.73 million coins in circulation. As long as demand remains strong, Bitcoin's price should, in theory, rise over time, especially if millions of new dollars are chasing a limited number of coins.Increased investment by major institutions and top companies could smooth out Bitcoin's manic price swings. Some analysts believe major institutional investors will continue to hold Bitcoin despite day-to-day price fluctuations, including a sharp plunge.Many retail investors, especially those who held Bitcoin for six months or less, sold during their recent downturn, analysis of blockchain activity showed. What looked like panic selling stoked Bitcoin's volatility.A small number of new coins are regularly added to the market.Tim Draper, a billionaire venture capitalist and Bitcoin investor, believes Bitcoin will hit $250,000 by 2022 or early 2023.""I think I'm going to be right on this one,"" Draper told CNBC.He first predicted Bitcoin's rise in 2018 when it fetched about $8,000.Draper made his money by investing in Twitter, Skype, Tesla, SpaceX and other top companies.But many believe Bitcoin has no real value and eventually its price will collapse.A survey of fund managers conducted by Bank of America in April found that 74% of respondents believed Bitcoin is a bubble. Nevertheless, about 10% of those responding to the survey said they believed Bitcoin would outperform the market as a whole in 2021.In a research note published in March, analysts at Bank of America said there is ""no good reason to own Bitcoin unless you see prices going up.""The crypto's volatility makes it unsuitable as a store of value or as a means to make payments, the bank's analysts concluded.In mid-day trading Tuesday, Bitcoin changed hands at $40,127.65, down 0.39% in the last 24 hours but up 37.80% for the year. The 24-hour range is $39,365.23 to $40,859.69 The all-time high is $64,829.14. The current market cap is $751.79 billion, CoinDesk reported.MarketPulseOwners are holding on to their vehicles longer, pushing the average age of cars on U.S. highways to a record 12.1 years, IHS Markit reported.The average age of cars on the road has increased in the last 15 years as quality has improved.The trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic as new car sales fell and many owners kept their current vehicles longer than planned during the lockdown, the London-based market information company said.But the trend is expected to ease and perhaps reverse this year as the economy reopens amid growing vaccination rates and rising new car sales.""The pandemic-induced rate of increase in average age is expected to be short-lived as 2021 will see a return of new vehicle registrations...as we adapt to post-pandemic norms,"" IHS Markit said.New car sales fell early in the pandemic as buyers stayed home and dealers struggled to follow social distancing guidelines. But sales picked up in the second half of 2020, boosting new registrations by about 5% for the year, suggesting demand for new cars remains strong.Buyers appear eager to spend this year, but kinks in the supply chain may crimp sales.The continuing microchip shortage is expected to limit new car production through the end of 2021. Chips are used in a range of applications, including anti-lock brakes, entertainment, in-dash displays and to boost engine performance.Nevertheless, IHS expects sales of light vehicles in the U.S. to reach 16.8 million this year compared with about 14.6 million in 2020. New car sales totaled about 17 million in 2019.The Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, kept interest rates low to support the economy during the lockdown and to support the recovery. Personal savings grew during the lockdown and many are eager to spend on big-ticket items, including new cars.J.D. Power said the average cost of a new vehicle in May was $38,255, a record high.Sales of electric vehicles continue to increase. There are now about 1 million electric vehicles in the U.S. and the average age is 3.9 years.IHS said 89% of electric vehicles sold between 2016 and 2020 are still registered to the first owner, compared with 68% of gasoline-powered cars for those model years.Most Tesla models range in price from $41,190 to $91,190. The roadster starts at $200,000 and climbs to $250,000 for the spiffier version.A full-sized pickup truck starts at $48,000. Tesla semis designed for commercial use range in price from $150,000 to $200,000.The number of cars scrapped increased to about 15 million and the number of miles driven declined 13% in 2020 from the previous year.Typically, taking cars out of service reduces the average age of cars still on the road because older vehicles are usually retired first. But slow sales of new cars during the pandemic created a statistical quirk and boosted the average age of cars on the road.A reduction in the miles driven allowed many owners to extend the service life of older cars.In addition, the average age of cars may be inflated by an increase in the number of vehicles not registered during the pandemic due to relaxed renewals in some states and owners putting cars in storage during the COVID-19 pandemic.Current market conditions boosted the value of used cars, and that's good news for independent repair shops that handle a good chunk of the work for vehicles no longer under warranty.

High Risk Choice    Low Risk Choice    Are Digital Currencies Sustainable?   Worthless Token Currency is a worthless token that we agree to use to facilitate transactions, to store value and as a unit of account. Variations in purchasing power among currencies are reflected in the exchange rates and the foreign exchange market has been a popular spot for traders for decades and even more recently. When capital market stability became the goal of global central banks after the financial crisis; currency exchange markets have been the only game in town for traders. Gone Digital The biggest game these days has been digital currencies. Digital currency exchange rates remain very volatile and therefore they fail to provide the functions of a “currency”. Their early appeal was the secrecy of the transaction. But authorities are all over your digital currency transactions now. With the secrecy attribute diminishing; digital currencies are less useful in transactions. Like all currencies, there is tremendous benefit to the issuer. The token is worthless but you can buy stuff with it which brings on the mindset of “let’s get as many tokens out as possible”. The problem is people must agree to accept them on demand. When it comes to the greenback, well, the wool is completely over our eyes as trillions and trillions of tokens are issued and we happily accept it. Value Proposition To try to make digital currencies more acceptable and slow their issuance BitCoin appeared with the silly proposition that if we waste a lot of energy and computer power to create the token the “it will have value”. A much more interesting early feature of bitcoin was a cap on the number of tokens that can be created. We will finally have a currency with a fixed number of tokens. That is very exciting for a money theorist since no other currency has ever had a fixed supply. But, in 2015 to 2018 when the exchange rate for bitcoin rose 9,500%, the value to the issuers (the bitcoin miners) became so huge that the fixed number of tokens idea was abandoned and supply exploded. Other token variations appeared and the total volume of tokens rose well beyond any intended fixed supply. From 2017 to 2019 the dollar exchange rate for bitcoin (incorrectly called the price in the financial media) trended down and fell 83%. The willingness to hold currency increases as interest rates fall so when rates of return on currency equivalents (like a bank account) drop to zero so does the incentive to convert currency so at least part of the 1,600% advance in BitCoin since 2019 has been a direct result of the ultra-loose money policies around government-controlled currencies.Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out. Digital Currencies Stocks to buy? With the recent sharp drop (42%) in the US dollar exchange rate for bitcoin it is a good time to look for opportunities. Two companies appear in our most recent update. One is attempting to make money with a leveraged trading strategy and the other is making money by extracting a brokerage spread. MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a small enterprise software company with $485 Million in sales last year. Over the past three quarters the company has spent $2,200 Million to purchase BitCoin. They financed the purchase with the issuance of $1,500 Million in debt (convertible). Their prowess as a trader is drawn into question after they missed the recent decline-one of the steepest drops in the dollar value of BitCoin in its history. This is a good high-risk choice for an investor who believes the in ever escalating dollar price of BitCoin. Evidence so far is that the company does not intend to trade BitCoin. At least they missed the most important selling opportunity since December 2017. Their reference to Bitcoin as a digital asset is preposterous. It is no more an asset than the greenback in your wallet is. The recent trend on Wall Street to describe BitCoin as an asset and even more bizarre-digital currencies as an asset-class is self-serving. High Risk Choice The company has already booked a $190 Million loss on the position and the shares are down 50% while Bitcoin is down 42% (the MSTR drop is a modest decline given the MSTR leverage of the bitcoin position). This is your high-risk choice and the shares can be expected to perform as well as bitcoin and better given the leverage. Low Risk Choice The other company that referenced digital currencies in its financial statements is Square (SQ). The company is ten times bigger than MSTR and BitCoin purchase is much smaller at $170 Million. This company has emerged as a broker in digital currencies. You can now open a digital currency account (a wallet) sponsored by well financed public company. The company is acting as a broker. A broker (very rare in modern times) purchases the token and sells it into customer Wallets at a premium (the spread is now about 8%). This is a much lower risk business and success will be more a function of the volume of trade than the dollar exchange rate. Square (SQ) is the better choice for lower risk investors if the digital currency space remains volatile. Bigger supporters will sustain the volume of transactions and Square will make money collecting a spread on the rising speculative volume. If the bitcoin exchange rate stabilizes and it becomes more useful as a preferred currency to facilitate transactions, Square will make money on the expanded transaction volume. Speculators can buy MSTR. High risk-oriented growth investors should buy SQ. Are Digital Currencies Sustainable? Digital currencies will not become broadly acceptable until exchange rates are more stable and that stability will make them much more boring for a trader. For the volume of trade in bitcoin to move beyond speculation and into adoption as a currency it must become more stable. Reliable and steadiness will facilitate transactions. BitCoin is accepted a bit more broadly recently but still you cannot buy a Tesla or in other words acts as a store of value. Holders of bitcoin recently have seen the value drop 42% as digital currencies attempted to be adopted as a global unit of account. No firm direction yet but they will meet stiff resistance from governments who are unwilling to give up the benefit as a currency issuer).

Influencers, such as the D'Amelio family and Tana Mongeau, have started to post paid advertisements on their social media platforms for different digital coins and exchanges.Even Kim Kardashian West posted an ad for ethereummax on her Instagram story on Sunday to her 228 million followers.Followed by a short clip of her speaking to her camera about ethereummax with ""#ad"" written at the bottom of the screen, Kardashian West posted text: ""Are you guys into crypto???"" ""This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends told me about the ethereum max token!"" the post read. She again added different hashtags, including #ad, which is required to reveal that her post is paid for, along with #emax and #disrupthistory.Other celebrities, including Floyd Mayweather, have endorsed ethereummax as well. Mayweather brought up the altcoin during the Bitcoin 2021 Conference earlier this month and was, in turn, booed off stage. Ethereummax was also accepted as payment for tickets to Mayweather's recent fight with YouTuber Logan Paul.Ethereummax is an altcoin that redistributes a small percentage of transactions to its token holders. It launched in May with a total supply of 2 quadrillion.However, despite its star-studded partnerships, ethereummax is viewed as a more risky cryptocurrency to some in the crypto world. As Decrypt points out, it's ""mostly just a marketing campaign.""⁠ Ethereummax doesn't have a white paper as other crypto projects do, and only a few details about its developers are known.""Ethereummax is much more than a 'marketing campaign,' we have filled a void and created a much-needed movement within the crypto space,"" members of the ethereummax team told CNBC Make It. They said that the team has been ""diligently working on"" a white paper for the currency. ""What I can tell you is we fully intend on delivering something special for our EMAX whitepaper,"" the team members said. ""Lastly, in terms of transparency, we have one of the strongest and most honest voices in the crypto community,"" they said. Though it's unknown how much Kardashian West was paid for the advertisement, a 2019 court filing revealed that she can reportedly earn between $300,000 and $500,000 for a single Instagram post. For long-term social media deals, she can sometimes earn millions of dollars. (Kardashian West did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.) Gen Z and young millennial influencers — many of which primarily have young followers — have posted paid ads for cryptocurrencies and exchanges recently as well.The family account of TikTok stars Charli, 17, and Dixie D'Amelio, 19, posted their partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini on Instagram in May, Insider reported.""We are learning more about cryptocurrency as a family, thank you @gemini for Charli's birthday gift. #GeminiPartner,"" the post read, though Gemini has an age requirement of 18 or older.The family's account has over 934,000 followers on Instagram, but Charli and Dixie have even larger followings themselves. Charli has over 117 million followers on TikTok and over 42 million on Instagram. Dixie has over 52 million followers on TikTok and over 24 million on Instagram.""We believe it's important to provide financial literacy and access to educational resources about cryptocurrency through various channels,"" a spokesperson for Gemini tells CNBC Make It. ""Gemini also works with influencers ... to help educate their followers about cryptocurrencies and raise awareness about the Gemini brand.""Along with the D'Amelio family, YouTubers like Paul and Loren Gray have posted endorsements for different cryptocurrencies and exchanges to their millions of followers. Even Matt James, known as the first Black male lead on ABC's ""The Bachelor,"" has posted on his social media about his partnership with crypto financial services company BlockFi. Though all cryptocurrency is considered to be a risky, volatile investment, the altcoins being pushed out by these influencers, like ethereummax, require even more caution, experts warn.

It has a deregulated power grid that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are very pro-crypto — dream conditions for a miner looking for a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.“You are going to see a dramatic shift over the next few months,” said Brandon Arvanaghi, previously a security engineer at crypto exchange Gemini. “We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible.”China’s mining dominance2021 data for the global distribution of mining power is not yet available, but past estimates have shown that 65 percent to 75 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining happened in China — mostly in four Chinese provinces: Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Sichuan and Yunnan’s hydropower make them renewable energy meccas, while Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are home to many of China’s coal plants. The drawdown in miners has already begun in Inner Mongolia. After failing to meet Beijing’s climate targets, province leaders decided to give bitcoin miners two months to clear out, explicitly blaming its energy misses on crypto mines. Castle Island Ventures founding partner Nic Carter says that while it’s not totally clear how China will handle next steps, it a phased rollout is likely. “It seems like we’re going from policy statement to actual implementation in relatively short order,” he said.The way this exodus is measured is by looking at hashrate, an industry term used to describe the computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network.“Given the drop in hashrate, it appears likely that installations are being turned off throughout the country,” continued Carter, who also thinks that probably 50 to 60 percent of bitcoin’s entire hashrate will ultimately leave China. Although China’s announcement hasn’t been cemented in policy, that isn’t stopping miners like Alejandro De La Torre from cutting their losses and making an exit.“We do not want to face every single year, some sort of new ban coming in China,” said De La Torre, vice president of Hong Kong-headquartered mining pool, Poolin. “So we’re trying to diversify our global mining hashrate, and that’s why we are moving to the United States and to Canada.”One of bitcoin’s greatest features is that it is totally location agnostic. Miners only require an internet connection, unlike other industries that must be relatively close to their end users. “The cool thing about bitcoin that is under appreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it’s a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,” explained Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.That said, the exodus won’t be instantaneous, in part, because it will take miners some time to either move their machines out of China or liquidate their assets and set up shop elsewhere. Where they’re goingBecause miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, they are incentivized to migrate to the world’s cheapest sources of power. “Every Western mining host I know has had their phones ringing off the hook,” said Carter. “Chinese miners or miners that were domiciled in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the U.S., and Northern Europe.”One likely destination is China’s next-door neighbor, Kazakhstan. The country’s coal mines provide a cheap and abundant energy supply. It also helps that Kazakhstan has a more lax attitude to building, which bodes well for miners who need to construct physical installations in a short period of time. Didar Bekbauov runs Xive, a company that provides hosting services to international miners. Xive also sells the specialized equipment needed for mining. Bekbauov says that he’s stopped counting the number of Chinese miners who have called him to ask about relocation options, ranging from operations with 15 rigs to thousands. “One miner told us that only government electricity plants have restricted mining and private ones will continue to service miners,” Bekbauov told CNBC. “But most of the electricity is generated by government power plants, so miners will have to move. That makes them uncertain and desperate to find other locations,” he said.Whether Kazakhstan is a destination or simply a stopover on a longer migration west remains to be seen. Arvanaghi is bullish on North America and thinks the hashrate there will grow over the next few months.“Texas not only has the cheapest electricity in the U.S. but some of the cheapest in the globe,” he said. “It’s also very easy to start up a mining company...if you have $30 million, $40 million, you can be a premier miner in the United States.”Wyoming has also trended toward being pro-bitcoin and could be another mining destination, according to Arvanaghi.There are, however, a few major limitations to the U.S. becoming a global mining destination.For one, the lead time to build the actual physical infrastructure necessary to host miners is likely six to nine months, Carter told CNBC. “The U.S. probably can’t be as nimble as other countries in terms of onshoring these stray miners,” he said.The move logistics may also prove difficult. There is a shipping container shortage, thanks to the tailwinds of the Covid pandemic. But perhaps the biggest question is the reliability of the Texas power grid. A storm that devastated large swaths of the state in 2020 has reignited a debate over whether Texas should winter-proof its systems, a potentially costly project that might affect taxes or other fees for those looking to tap into the state’s power grid. More recently, ERCOT, the organization that operates Texas’ grid, asked consumers to conserve energy amid what officials called an unusual number of “forced generation outages” and an upcoming heat wave.Answering the Musk critiqueTesla CEO Elon Musk has bashed bitcoin mining, claiming that it is bad for the environment. It’s not a new criticism.For years, skeptics have maligned the world’s most popular digital token for polluting the planet, while supporters have extolled the virtues of bitcoin and its role in accelerating the rise of renewable energy. It is unclear whether the China mining exodus will make or break the case for bitcoin enthusiasts in the debate around the token’s carbon footprint. The dominant narrative, to date, has been that much of the world’s bitcoin is mined with Chinese goal. “From a narrative perspective, it’s definitely an improvement,” said Carter. “But China also has the most abundant stranded hydro resources in the world.”The country offers significant energy vectors from wind, solar, and especially hydropower in the south. Xinjiang’s grid, for example, is 35 percent powered by wind and solar energy inputs.If all the miners do end up leaving China, it will mean less fossil fuel-powered mining, but it will also mean that the network’s share of renewable energy-powered mining will drop. This is why the question of where these migrant miners end up could prove critical to bitcoin’s future. “It’s the biggest story of the year for bitcoin,” said Carter. De La Torre says they’re looking to expand operations using green energy, a trend that is already years in the making. He says that hydro plants are generally cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world.“Mining is price sensitive, so as to seek out the lowest cost power and the lowest cost power tends to be renewable because if you’re burning fossil fuels...it has extraction, refinement, and transport costs,” explained Blockstream CEO Adam Back. Each year, investment bank Lazard releases a breakdown of energy costs by source. Its 2020 report shows that many of the most common renewable energy sources are either equal to or less expensive than conventional energy sources like coal and gas. And the cost of renewable power keeps going down.But there are limitations to running crypto mines purely on renewable energy.Though solar and wind are now the world’s least expensive energy sources, both power supplies face limitations at scale, so there is concern over the viability of miners turning exclusively to wind or solar energy.Next six monthsFor the time being, there isn’t that much mining capacity worldwide that is ready to absorb the Chinese miner diaspora. While they scramble to find a new home, we could see hashrate go offline — and stay offline. In practice, that would mean all the remaining miners are more profitable for a period of time. Having more geographic dispersion would even out the global balance of power, and it would also reduce the ability of any one sovereign nation to co-opt or control the network.We may also see special crypto economic zones pop up in the next few months.“You will see jurisdictions adopting a very favorable stance and creating the equivalent of special zones to encourage miners to host locally,” said Carter. “We’re seeing it at the state level here. You’re also gonna see it at the country level, you might even see subsidized electricity for mining.”",2021-06-15

For 70 years, meetings between American presidents and Soviet or Russian leaders were dominated by one looming threat: the vast nuclear arsenals that the two nations started amassing in the 1940s, as instruments of intimidation and, if deterrence failed, mutual annihilation. Now, as President Joe Biden prepares to meet with President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday, for the first time cyberweapons are being elevated to the top of the agenda.The shift has been brewing for a decade, as Russia and the United States, the two most skilled adversaries in the cyber arena, have each turned to a growing arsenal of techniques in what has become a daily, low-level conflict. But at summit meetings, that sort of jousting was usually treated as a sideshow to the main superpower competition.No more. The rising tempo and sophistication of recent attacks on American infrastructure — from gasoline pipelines running up the East Coast, to plants providing one-quarter of America's beef, to the operations of hospitals and the internet itself — has revealed a set of vulnerabilities no president can ignore.For Biden, nuclear weapons still matter, and his aides say the two men will spend a good amount of time debating ""strategic stability,"" shorthand for containing nuclear escalation. But the more immediate task, Biden told his allies at a Group of 7 summit meeting in Cornwall, England, last week and a NATO meeting in Brussels, is to convince Putin he will pay a high price for playing the master of digital disruption.It will not be easy. If a decade of intensifying cyberconflict has taught anything, it is that the traditional tools of deterrence have largely failed.The Colonial Pipeline Company in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company was hit by a ransomware attack. Photo / APAnd while Putin loves to boast about his huge investments in new, nuclear torpedoes and hypersonic weapons, he also knows he cannot use them. His arsenal of cyberweapons, in contrast, is put to work every day.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Biden has made clear that he intends to give Putin a choice: Cease the attacks, and crack down on the cybercriminals operating from Russian territory, or face a rising set of economic costs and what Biden calls a set of moves by the United States to ""respond in kind."" But Sunday, while still at the Group of 7 summit in Cornwall, he acknowledged that Putin may well ignore him.""There's no guarantee you can change a person's behavior or the behavior of his country,"" Biden said.

They are the first to say that arms control treaties, the main tool employed in the nuclear age, are not well adapted to the cyberrealm. There are just too many players — nations, criminal groups, terrorist organizations — and no way to do the equivalent of counting warheads and missiles.But their hope is to get Putin to begin discussing targets that should be off the table in peacetime. The list includes electric grids, election systems, water and energy pipelines, nuclear power plants and — most delicate of all — nuclear weapons command-and-control systems.President Vladimir V. Putin, right, giving an interview in Moscow last week. Despite evidence to the contrary, he denied any Russian role in cyber attacks. Photo / APOn paper, that would seem to be relatively easy. After all, an expert group of the United Nations, with representatives of all the major powers, has repeatedly agreed to some basic limits.In reality, it is proving agonisingly difficult — far more so than the first attempt at nuclear arms control that President Dwight Eisenhower broached with Nikita Khrushchev in Geneva 66 years ago, just before the Cold War spun into a terrifying arms race and, seven years later, nuclear confrontation in Cuba.President Ronald Reagan said ""we need to 'trust, but verify,'"" noted Eric Rosenbach, the former head of cyber policy at the Pentagon, who helped navigate the early days of cyberconflict with Russia, China and Iran when Biden was vice president. ""When it comes to the Russians and cyber, you definitely cannot trust or verify,"" he said.""The Russians have repeatedly violated the terms of any agreements on cyber at the United Nations, and are now systematically trying to tie up the United States"" in a morass of international legal issues ""while hitting our critical infrastructure,"" Rosenbach said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Putin refuses to acknowledge that Russia uses these weapons at all, suggesting that the accusations are part of a giant, American-led disinformation campaign.""We have been accused of all kinds of things,'' Putin told NBC News over the weekend. ""Election interference, cyberattacks and so on and so forth. And not once, not once, not one time, did they bother to produce any kind of evidence or proof. Just unfounded accusations.""In fact, evidence has been produced, though it is far harder to show, much less explain, than the photographs of Soviet missiles in Cuba that President John F. Kennedy displayed on television at a critical moment in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.But Putin is right about one thing. The ease with which he can deny any knowledge of cyberoperations — something the United States has done as well, even after mounting major attacks on Iran and North Korea — demonstrates why the deterrents that kept an uneasy nuclear peace in the Cold War won't work with digital threats.In the nuclear age, America knew where every Soviet weapon was located and who had the authority to fire them. In the cyberage, there is no way to count the threats or even figure out who has their finger on the keyboard — the modern-day ""button."" A general? Hackers working for the SVR, the premier Russian intelligence agency? Other hackers, freelancing for a ransomware ""service provider"" like DarkSide, which was responsible for the attack on the company that ran the Colonial Pipeline? Teenagers?In the nuclear age, it was abundantly clear what would happen to a country that unleashed its weapons on the United States. In the cyberage it is anything but clear.When Sony Entertainment's studios were attacked by North Korea, in response to a movie that mocked Kim Jong Un, 70 per cent of the company's computers were destroyed. The head of the National Security Agency at the time, Adm. Michael Rogers, said later he had been sure the assault would bring a major American response.It did not.During the Obama administration, a successful Russian effort to break into the unclassified email systems of the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff was never publicly attributed to Moscow — even though everyone, including then-Vice President Biden, knew the intelligence indicated the hack came out of Moscow.The muted response to the Russian effort to influence the 2016 election came only after the results were in. Obama's reaction was comparatively mild: the expulsion of Russian diplomats and the closing of some diplomatic compounds. It was, in the words of one senior official at the time, ""the perfect 19th century response to a 21st century problem.''Then came Trump's time in office, in which he repeated, approvingly, Putin's improbable denials of election interference. America lost four years in which it could have been trying to set some global standards, what Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, calls a ""cyber Geneva Convention.""While the US Cyber Command stepped up its fight, sending the digital equivalent of a brushback pitch to a Russian intelligence agency and knocking a major ransomware group offline during the 2018 midterm elections, the Russian assaults have continued. What worries the Biden national security team is not the volume of the attacks, but their sophistication.Thousands of private and government users downloaded a tainted software update that gave Russian hackers a foothold into their systems, according to SolarWinds. Photo / APThe SolarWinds attack was not just another hack: Roughly 1,000 hackers at the SVR, according to an estimate by Microsoft, were involved in a complex effort that got the Russians into the supply chain of software funnelled into government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and think tanks. Worse yet, the attack was mounted from inside the United States — from Amazon servers — because the Russians knew that US intelligence agencies are forbidden to operate on US soil.Biden said he wanted a ""proportional response,'' and settled on more economic sanctions — hinting there may be other ""unseen"" actions — but it is far from clear those left an impression. ""The issue of state-sponsored cyberattacks of that scope and scale remains a matter of grave concern to the United States,'' Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, said aboard Air Force One on the way to Europe last week. The issue, he said, is ""not over.""The SolarWinds hack was followed by an astounding surge in ransomware attacks, the headline-grabbing extortion schemes in which criminal hacker groups lock up a company or hospital's data, then demand millions in Bitcoin to unlock it. Biden has accused Russia of harbouring those groups, even if they are not working for the Russian government.Rosenbach, the former Pentagon cyber policy chief, said that ransomware gives Biden an opening. ""Rather than focus on naively abstract 'rules of the road,' Biden should press Putin hard on concrete actions, such as halting the scourge of ransomware attacks against US critical infrastructure,'' he said.""Putin has plausible deniability,"" he said, ""and the threat of additional sanctions is likely enough to convince Putin to take quiet action against"" the groups responsible for the attacks.That would be a start, if a small one.If the history of nuclear arms control applies again — and it may not — expectations should be low. It is far too late to hope for the elimination of cyberweapons, any more than one could hope to eliminate guns. The best we could do might be a first attempt at a digital ""Geneva Convention"" limiting the use of cyberweapons against civilians. And the perfect place to try may be in Geneva itself.But that is almost certainly further than Putin is willing to go. With his economy overly dependent on fossil fuels, and his population showing signs of restiveness, his sole remaining superpower is the disruption of his democratic rivals.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Written by: David E.

""As long as they do not carry out nefarious activities in Russia itself, they seem to be protected from severe prosecution.""Why Russia takes a 'hands-off' approachAn underground network of hackers has sprouted up in Russia in recent decades, the Post reported, driven by animosity for western countries after Russia fell on hard times following the Soviet Union's collapse. Advertisement   Advertisement  One former hacker-turned-analyst told the paper he turned to hacking to find money after studying information security in college, and more educated youth in Russia are turning to cybercrime since ""there is so much money to be made.""Experts told the Post that cybercriminals might not only be working out of Russia because the Kremlin is allowing them to — they may even be working for the government in some cases. However, Subrahmanian said there isn't currently any evidence that the cybercriminals do Moscow's bidding.""There's just too much of this going on right now for this not to have at least implicit hands-off policy by the Russian state,"" he said. ""And at the very worst, it could be an explicit go-ahead.

After the market tumbled 34% with the onset of COVID, many ordinary folks—enabled by commission-free trading pioneered by Robinhood—became investors and others piled up record sums in tax-sheltered retirement vehicles.                       Time is one of the most important tools in investing thanks to the 'miracle' of compounding interest. Here's what it is, how it works, and why it can help you.              Since March of last year, the S&P 500          SPX,         -0.77%        has rebounded about 90% but how that happened in an economy that lost 22 million jobs and is still 10 million below pre-COVID trend owes a lot to the peculiar nature of the COVID recession. In large measure, permanent business closures were concentrated among small enterprises. Healthy corporations were able to curtail investments to build cash buffers. Rock-bottom interest rates permitted firms rendered to junk status, such as Ford          F,         +1.13%,        to raise funds in bond markets. The private economy proved surprisingly adaptable. Zooming and other cloud software replaced business travel and daily commutes with the potential historic significance that the Gutenberg printing press displaced the monk’s quill. Hybrid office-home work arrangements will become more the norm after the pandemic is behind us. As restaurants, stores and other businesses reopened, encouraging stories abounded about American companies pouring billions into the next generation’s technologies. Consider electric-vehicle startups such as Tesla          TSLA,         -3.17%        and Rivian, Amazon’s          AMZN,         -2.17% Cloud revolution, Apple’s          AAPL,         -0.99%  call for engineers to literally invent 6G internet technology, and Alphabet’s GOOG,         -1.45%,        Apple’s and GM’s GM,         +1.16%        investments in artificial intelligence for autonomous driving.Profits surging With the vaccines’ rollout a dramatic success, economic growth and corporate profits are now surging. The ordinary investor—the same guy who routed professional short sellers in the GameStop          GME,         +1.75%        saga—anticipated all this and poured money into stocks for big gains. They had few other choices. Treasury securities, CDs and money-market funds sported negative real yields, and the important thing to remember is that calculus still applies. Should the Fed curtail its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases or raise the federal funds rate, the 10-year Treasury rate          TMUBMUSD10Y,         4.910%        could rise to 2.5%. That’s still on the low-end of the historical range and only in line with expected inflation. Government bonds, high-quality corporate debt and CDs will pay ordinary folks very little or nothing after adjusting for expected inflation—and negative rates after they pay income taxes. But equities still offer ordinary folks the opportunity for returns that outrun inflation.61% growth Don’t be fooled by today’s frothy valuations. The S&P 500 is currently selling for about 45 times current earnings—well above the 25-year average of 26—but profits are accelerating at a torrid pace and those have yet to hit the scoreboard. Second-quarter earnings, which will be reported in July and August, are expected to surge 61%. That would lower the S&P 500 price-earnings ratio to 25—a bit below the 25-year average. That implies an equivalent interest rate of about 4%—well above the likely 10-year Treasury rate even if the Fed tightens monetary policy. Those returns make stocks look like a bargain and a safe haven if investors’ personal circumstances permit them to ride out year-to-year turbulence and invest for five years or longer—specifically, their retirement nest eggs and college funds. For the adventurous, bitcoin          BTCUSD,         +2.90%        may appear to replace gold          GC00,         +1.23%        as the inflation hedge and political-risk asset of choice but like gold, it exhibits a great deal of volatility. Much higher transactions fees than credit and debit cards and IRS tax rules that force capital-gains calculations for each purchase make it virtually useless for day-to-day shopping. And cryptocurrencies likely face increased government regulation. Picking winners among stocks is tough in an economy quickly shifting in the composition of goods and services people buy and with technological edges among companies rapidly shifting. The outlook for profits in the second half of this year and into the next remains strong. Ordinary investors would still do well to set aside enough cash for emergencies and put long-term savings into an S&P 500 or broader index fund.

Such cars are normally major gas guzzlers. But not Swedish Koeniggseg. The company, which makes about 30 cars annually that sell for a couple of million each, recently hired a former Tesla executive to help it transform into a mass car manufacturer—a mass car manufacturer of vehicles that use the emissions of volcanoes as a way to moderate their carbon footprint.In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Koeniggseg's new chief industrialization officer Evan Horetsky explained the volcano emission idea simply.    ""So there is this technology from Iceland, it was invented there, where they cap the CO2 emittance from semi-active volcanoes and convert that into methanol,"" Horetsky said. ""And if you take that methanol and you power the plants that do the conversion of other fuels and then power the ship that transports those fuels to Europe or the U.S. or Asia, wherever it goes, you put the fuel completely CO2-neutral into the vehicle.""The developer of this technology is an Icelandic firm, Carbon Recycling. In 2013, the MIT Technology Review wrote about the company's technology that turned carbon dioxide emissions from a geothermal plant into methanol—a raw material for a number of productions, including plywood and paints, but also a fuel.  In the article, the author Kevin Bulis noted that Carbon Recycling had the advantage of having access to cheaper CO2 than the one that, for instance, coal power plants emit. The difference in cost comes from the process that leads to the emission. In the geothermal plant, the CO2 is the product of the decomposition of carbonate rocks near a volcano. In a coal power plant, carbon dioxide is one of the components of so-called flue gas – the product of burning coal.Therefore, at a geothermal plant, the stream of CO2 is a lot more concentrated and a lot purer. This makes its use easier and therefore cheaper. In a coal power plant, you need to first separate the CO2 from the other constituents of flue gas and then process it into methanol, which makes the process a lot more expensive. Related: Investors Are Buying Bitcoin In A Bear Market But Ignoring Oil In A Bull MarketExpensive or not, according to a Verge article from last year, Koeniggseg's Gemera hybrid runs on ""renewable alcohol fuel."" The publication called the Gemera ""the world's most wickedly weird hybrid,"" noting its three electric motors and a three-cylinder, internal combustion engine that runs on methanol.   Koeniggseg itself calls the Gemera's internal combustion engine the Tiny Friendly Giant, and boasts that it has a 15-20 percent lower fuel consumption than a typical four-cylinder engine, lower cold-start emissions, and, perhaps most impressive of all, says that this engine actually cleans the air.""When running the TFG on renewable alcohol fuels – there are virtually no particulates produced and in many ""normal"" environments the TFG consumes and burns more particles from the surrounding air than it produces, thereby actually cleaning the air,"" the company says in the description of its TFG engine. ""Using the best alternatives of alcohols there is even the chance for net-zero or CO2 negative emissions.""It sounds somewhat paradoxical, and the company admits it. Yet the engine that runs on alcohol is very much a real thing and, per Keniggseg's plans, will become a much more common thing as the company ramps up its vehicle production. Whether the methanol these future Koeniggsegs will use will come from volcano-related CO2 emissions, however, remains to be seen. You need a handy nearby volcano for this. Yet, there are other ways to get negative emissions from a car, according to Horetsky.""Depending on the environment you're in, you can kind of clean up the particles in the atmosphere while you're using the engine,"" he told Bloomberg. ""So you can be very much environmentally conscious doing that. It's just a fun aspect of renewable fuels that are not talked so much about, but there are many, many other technologies that are coming up.""

After 12 years being long and strong and having diamond hands without even knowing that term existed, maybe I’m wrong to turn more cautious. Maybe the economy will reopen and rejuvenate the country in such a strong manner that corporate earnings in 2022 and 2023 will make today’s prices seem like bargains.   But I simply don’t think that’s the most likely outcome. And if I’m right that we’re in the throes of the Blow-Off Top of the Bubble-Blowing Bull Market, I do not want to be overly long and on the wrong side of the great unwind when it does start.  I’m not calling for a near-term crash. I am saying that it’s likely going to be hard for the bulls to make as much money this year as they did last year. Trading and investing are tough. There’s always someone on the other side of every trade you make. Always think about who that is and why they are willing to take the other side of your transaction. When you buy, why are they selling it to you at that price? When you sell, who is buying it from you and what are their motivations? Remember, I’ve talked before about how good analysis starts with empathy.If I’m selling, who’s buying — and why? So let’s answer this question right now. Who is buying stocks and cryptos from me when I’ve trimmed and sold for the past month or so? Sure, there are banks and institutions and hedge funds and family offices investing and trading, just as always. On the other hand, remember two years ago when I got back from a hedge fund investment conference in Abu Dhabi and everybody was desperate for returns: Amid low interest rates and other investors’ focus on options, credit and currencies, “the lack of focus on traditional stocks and funds that invest in publicly traded stocks makes me think that there is probably more opportunity in such assets than people realize. I certainly see some very compelling long ideas in Revolutionary companies like WORK and TWTR and TSLA.” Since that post, back a year and a half ago, Slack          WORK        went from $21 to being bought out at $45, Twitter          TWTR        went from $27 to $61, and Tesla          TSLA,         -3.18%        went from $81 to $616. And funds that were looking everywhere but in the stock market for big gains are … well, pretty much in the markets now and long a bunch of stocks and even long a few cryptos. And now that those stocks and cryptos and most other assets have gone parabolic in the past year — coming on top of the 10-year bull market — the billion-dollar fund managers are joined by 23-year-old TikTok influencers doing bitcoin          BTCUSD,         +2.90%        trading astrology.  Yes, for real, and she’s very popular. She’s even been right about some of bitcoin’s action in the past few months! If you’re selling cryptos and fintech stocks right now, you’re selling to her and her followers. And also to my friend’s son, who just graduated from a tiny, rural school and whose unemployed uncle gave him $500 to “buy some cryptos. And make sure you get some fintech. I don’t know the symbol, but just look it up and you’ll do fine over the long run.” Bearish anecdotes everywhere I look, as I wrote recently.Mr. Market The other thing to remember about who’s on the other side of your trade is always to remember that there are smart, cutthroat traders and investors who went to the best schools and have access to more research and real-time data and instant trading access to all kinds of derivatives to layer into their bets. And the only thing they do all day, every day, is figure out how to take your money in mostly legal ways. They’re not playing around. They have no sympathy for you, even if they might empathize with you to better understand your motivations to better take your money. Mr. Market is mean. He’s not nice. He can be cruel. He can force liquidations that create other liquidations. He can shut off access to capital. He can take down 200-year-old banks in a day. In one day. Sometimes the markets lead the economy and not the other way around. Ironically, when we were young, we were taught that the Great Depression started when the stock market crashed on Black Friday in 1929. But then when we get older, we were taught that it wasn’t actually the crash that created the Great Depression, rather the economy was already crashing and the stock market just didn’t realize it as it continued on its merry way toward a terrible Blow-Off Top of a nine-year Bubble-Blowing Bull Market that culminated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average          DJIA,         -0.33%        up 400% from the 1921 lows to the 1929 highs.           Learning from Soros But looking back, it’s clear that both theories are equally right and wrong — the market crashed because the economy wasn’t as good as the market thought it was, and the economy crashed because the markets shut down access to capital for investment and growth.  It was “reflexive,” to borrow a term from the great hedge fund manager George Soros. He wrote, and the concept is important to understand: “I continued to consider myself a failed philosopher. All this changed as a result of the financial crisis of 2008. My conceptual framework enabled me both to anticipate the crisis and to deal with it when it finally struck… “I can state the core idea in two relatively simple propositions. One is that in situations that have thinking participants, the participants’ view of the world is always partial and distorted. That is the principle of fallibility. The other is that these distorted views can influence the situation to which they relate because false views lead to inappropriate actions. That is the principle of reflexivity… “Recognizing reflexivity has been sacrificed to the vain pursuit of certainty in human affairs, most notably in economics, and yet, uncertainty is the key feature of human affairs. Economic theory is built on the concept of equilibrium, and that concept is in direct contradiction with the concept of reflexivity… “A positive feedback process is self-reinforcing. It cannot go on forever because eventually the participants’ views would become so far removed from objective reality that the participants would have to recognize them as unrealistic. Nor can the iterative process occur without any change in the actual state of affairs, because it is in the nature of positive feedback that it reinforces whatever tendency prevails in the real world. Instead of equilibrium, we are faced with a dynamic disequilibrium or what may be described as far-from-equilibrium conditions. Usually in far-from-equilibrium situations the divergence between perceptions and reality leads to a climax which sets in motion a positive feedback process in the opposite direction. Such initially self-reinforcing but eventually self-defeating boom-bust processes or bubbles are characteristic of financial markets, but they can also be found in other spheres. There, I call them fertile fallacies—interpretations of reality that are distorted, yet produce results which reinforce the distortion.”Stay flexible Far-from-equilibrium conditions was what we had in 2010-2013 when we loaded up on Revolutionary stocks and started buying cryptos like bitcoin. Far-from-equilibrium conditions might be what we have in front of us right now when I suggest getting cautious instead. We don’t want to be permabulls. (You for sure don’t want to be a permabear!) We have to be flexible. We have to let our analysis and risk/reward scenarios dictate how much risk we’re taking and when. We have to pay attention to the cycles, the self-reinforcing cycles that drive economies and markets and valuations and earnings and societal interactions and bailouts and financial crises and bubbles and busts and, heaven forbid, just simple stagnation. It’s as if everybody forgets that markets can bubble and crash and stagnate. They forget that markets can grind for years on end without making new highs, or without even making higher highs. Do you not remember telling your money manager sometime in 2010-2012 that “If I’d just handled the Great Financial Crisis (and/or the Dot-Com Crash) a little better, I’d be in better shape.” I used to hear people say that to me all the time. I haven’t heard anybody say that lately. Everybody’s having fun in this market … at least for now. Most traders will tell you that they are “just trading the market that is in front of them.” Well, I don’t know when the bubble will pop, but I do know that I don’t want to be on the wrong side of this market when it does. And I do know that we won’t know the bubble has really popped until the self-reinforcing reflexive feedback loop has made it painful for the vast majority of people who are right now feeling wealthy, feeling secure, feeling like they’ve got this trading and investing thing all figured out. We are all fallible. Be careful while it’s fun. Be bold when it’s painful. That’s how I’ve done it for the last 25 years. We were boldly buying these assets when it was painful for others. I’m careful right now because everybody else is having fun. I spend a lot of time looking for new ideas and I won’t let my overall market outlook deter me from buying a new name or two. But I want to remain overall cautious and less aggressive than I have been for most of the last decade.  As a matter of fact, I might have at least a couple Trade Alerts that I’ll be sending out this week, one long and one short idea. Being flexible, see?

Around the globe, people look to the meme coin to make profits. While some people buy Dogecoin to make returns, others use their PCs to mine the token.      MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY          SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT     So, if you’re curious about how to mine Dogecoin using your computer, read on.       What Is Cryptocurrency Mining?  Crypto miners use their computers to solve the complex mathematical equations needed to verify transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain network.  In return for their contributions to the blockchain network, miners are rewarded with the network's tokens. Dogecoin miners receive the meme coins for their contributions to the Dogecoin network.  Related: What Is a Blockchain and How Does it Work?     Mining Dogecoin with a CPU and GPU        CPU: You can use your PC’s central processing unit (CPU) to mine Dogecoin. This component of your PC is used to retrieve and execute instructions. Special CPU miner software such as CPU Miner may be downloaded for free to mine with the CPU.   GPU: You may also use the graphics processing unit (GPU) on your PC to mine Dogecoin. GPUs process large volumes of data, making them useful for games, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining.       GPUs are considered to be better alternatives to CPUs for mining Dogecoin because they are designed for higher levels of activity.  This makes them less likely to overheat and more effective at processing information for the mining process. Dogecoin mining software, such as EasyMiner, provides a user-friendly interface for people who want to mine with GPUs.  Related: What Is Dogecoin and Why Is Elon Musk So Interested In It?     Dogecoin Mining Pools  A mining pool is a group of cryptocurrency miners who share their computational resources to carry out mining activities over a blockchain network.  Related: What the Heck Is Dogecoin, Is Chia Really Green, and What Is Internet Computer?  Joining a Dogecoin mining pool could make it much easier for you to earn from mining activities at a faster rate. This is possible because mining pools share the power needed to mine Doge. While solo miners could make more, it can take more time to mine without a mining pool.  Aikapool is a popular Dogecoin mining pool that you may join. To join the Dogecoin mining pool, you must provide a PIN when you sign up. The PIN is also required to withdraw earnings. After signing up to Aikapool, you may obtain new worker details needed to mine Dogecoin in the mining pool.     You can create an Aikapool mining pool account for use in the EasyMiner setup guide below.     EasyMiner Setup Guide  Here's how you setup the EasyMiner Dogecoin mining tool.                Download and install EasyMiner.   Start the software. A popup will appear asking you for information to mine Litecoin. Click Skip & Exit so that you may configure it for Dogecoin instead.   Click on the Setup icon to access the configuration screen for the miner.   Fill the necessary with worker information from the mining pool (in this case, Aikapool).   Close the configuration screen.   Click on Start Mining next to the Configuration icon.                      What's the Best Dogecoin Wallet?  As a Dogecoin miner, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports Dogecoin. The wallet is needed to store the coins you earn as a miner. A recommended wallet may be found on the Dogecoin website, though we also recommend secure desktop wallets such as Exodus or Atomic.     Should You Start Mining Dogecoin?  While your PC may be powerful enough to mine Dogecoin, it is not always advisable. This is because less powerful computers may overheat when mining, causing irreversible damage. It is important to use your best judgment as some PCs may not be powerful enough to handle the process of mining without overheating.  ",2021-06-15

His remarks come a week after the country’s Legislative Assembly approved the use of the cryptocurrency as legal tender.El Salvador’s 2001 Law of Monetary Integration, which provided the legislative framework to eventually replace the Salvadoran colón with the U.S. dollar, states that salaries and fees may only be paid in colónes or dollars.

""Furthermore, the expected tapering of asset purchases by the Fed should allow 10-year interest rates to drift higher even as the overnight rate remains pegged near zero, which favors value over growth stocks, as the latter depends more on future cash flows.""But now that value has been driven up for roughly half a year … what value is left?You can always rely on value ETFs to do the choosing for you, as their methodologies can rotate out of some stocks as their prices go from low to lofty.If you're picking on your own, we can at least point you in the right direction.

It has no legitimate use-case. It is not something that I think is doing the crypto community any good in its efforts to generate credibility and legitimacy in the financial marketplace, or approval by the SEC.”""Doggy-coin, which is the other pronunciation for this, misspelling of the word doggy, D-O-G-E, is the bad boy of crypto,"" he added.The cryptocurrency was invented as an alternative to bitcoin back in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the latter of which would later leave the project. The name derives from the “Doge” internet meme, a surrealist trend that featured a popular photo of a Shiba Inu.Dogecoin has been a highly speculative asset, at times experiencing 20%-30% volatility daily. Edelman said that it may come dangerously close to fraud territory. Dogecoin essentially is a victim of a “pump and dump scheme,” he said, by extremely wealthy individuals like Elon Musk.The cryptocurrency has received criticism in the past for having no underlying value; some analysts have called it a bubble in light of the 2021 run that saw Dogecoin multiply 100 times over in value. Yet startups and investors have raised millions of dollars for Dogecoin funds.“[Dogecoin is] creating the environment for people to do crazy things in crazy chat rooms, and creating a bump and dump environment of people who are trying to get rich quick,” Edelman said. “So there's a big difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin and jokes like Doggy-coin.”Bullish on bitcoin and EthereumOutside of Dogecoin, Edelman said other cryptocurrencies can be promising. “I'm actually more excited about Ethereum than I am about bitcoin, although I'm bullish on both,” he said. “And there's a whole variety of others. But I would say if you're just getting started, bitcoin and Ethereum are about 80% of the market. That's plenty. So just go ahead and do those.”Story continuesThe price of Bitcoin fell almost 37% in May, and remains down 38% from the mid-April peak. Bitcoin’s price increased yesterday after Elon Musk announced Tesla would resume accepting Bitcoin transactions when the cryptocurrency becomes more environmentally-friendly.Meanwhile, Ethereum began the year at a price of under $800 and currently stands at over $2,500. This past May, it reached an all-time high of over $4,100.Edelman recommended using funds like Grayscale (GBTC), Osprey (OBTC), and Bitwise (BITW) to help with investing in cryptocurrencies. “These funds are readily available if you're an accredited investor, investments such as SkyBridge, that allow you to invest in it the way you invest in any kind of mutual fund or ETF,” he said.Edelman, who disclosed that he is an investor in Bitwise, also noted that the fund offers a top 10 crypto index fund that could be useful to potential investors.More from Ihsaan:Electric aircraft company Vertical Aerospace plans to go publicOnly 20% of Americans familiar with NFTs, 4 million have used: SurveyBitcoin to tumble further: oddsmakers bet on drop to $10KRead the latest cryptocurrency and bitcoin news from Yahoo FinanceRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit",2021-06-15

And the distinctions between the providers' offerings are magnified as the race to win over Wall Street, and its money, heats up. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM, and Microsoft Azure have made in-roads with financial firms in recent years. IBM and Microsoft unveiled finance-specific business lines this spring, while AWS and Google Cloud announced plans to tackle financial data and analytics with the release of Amazon FinSpace and Google Cloud Datashare, respectively. This story is available exclusively to Insider                             subscribers.                             Become an Insider                             and start reading now. Have an account? Log in. The impetus? ""If you want to make money, go where the money is,"" Melanie Posey, research director of cloud and managed services of 451 Research, an arm of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, told Insider, referring to the wave of financial firms opening up their budgets to tap the scalability, resiliency, and innovation that comes from using the public cloud.""That's where the big money is,"" she added.As more Wall Street firms pair up with public-cloud providers, industry analysts are taking notice of the differing strategic approaches — and the financial institutions gravitating toward each one. To be sure, the public cloud market has matured over the last five to seven years, making the perceived differences between the major providers subtle.That wasn't the case in the early 2010s. AWS used to be a leader in geographic coverage while Google Cloud dominated data and analytics. But since then, competitors have caught up, Posey said. ""At this point, it comes down to differentiation where the installed base of existing customers tends to be. And particular use cases are what separates the hyperscalers out into the broader market,"" Posey said. ""It's not necessarily the case anymore that one player has a huge strategic advantage just in terms of product over any of the others.""Here's a breakdown of the biggest strengths of four public-cloud providers looking to serve Wall Street. Amazon Web ServicesTop strength: Scope and depth of offerings AWS often leads with its 15 years of experience in financial cloud migration when pitching to financial services, according to an October 2020 report from 451 Research, but the greater pull is really its suite of offerings. ""AWS overall gets the top mark for having the best breadth and depth of different services and capabilities and features,"" Posey said. ""Its product portfolio, objectively speaking, has the most individual SKUs as part of its public cloud offering than anybody.""SKUs are a way of tracking the number of items for sale and can fluctuate based on pricing. For public cloud providers, this can be tied back to the number and variations of services and tools offered. At the end of 2020, AWS had around 2 million unique SKUs for sale, compared with Azure's 80,000 and Google's 18,000, according to analysis by 451 Research. Since its 2006 founding, AWS has attracted born-in-the-cloud companies, Posey said. Coinbase, for one, runs its global bitcoin exchanges and wallets on AWS, while trading app Robinhood uses AWS to operate its online business and update its mobile app, according to AWS. Stripe has used AWS since 2011 to deliver its payment offering.AWS has also inked deals with some of the biggest names in finance.One of its marquee banking customers can be traced back to 2015, when Capital One announced its partnership with AWS. Since then, Capital One has taken its cloud migration one step further, announcing in February that it would ditch its data centers and migrate fully to AWS' on-demand cloud infrastructure. JPMorgan Chase and Millennium Management, the New York-based hedge fund with more than $51.5 billion in assets under management, are other incumbents plugged into AWS. The firms are using AWS' data and machine-learning tools to improve trading analytics and AI initiatives.Google CloudTop strength: Data analytics and new distribution channels for fintechsGoogle Cloud's position in the market was built on its data and analytics capabilities, and it still leverages that strength today, Posey said. There are over a dozen in-house tools and features listed on Google Cloud's website that address data warehousing, data integration, preparation of data for machine learning use, and interactive dashboarding, to name a few.                                                            FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images                                                        A more recent example of Google putting its data-engineering strength to work is through the launch of Datashare, a financial data exchange launched in June. It automates the thorny process of standardizing various data sets into a uniform format so customers can manage and analyze diverse data from various providers in a consistent way.                                                    Google Cloud has scored big names on Wall Street, including Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Deutsche Bank. ""We are a wholesaler of risk, we need to be measuring, factoring, analyzing and monitoring risk and it consumes a lot of compute power,"" Goldman Sachs co-CIO George Lee said at a Google Cloud event in July 2020, adding that its partnership with Google Cloud allows the bank to do that at scale. It's also a ""natural choice"" for companies born in the digital era, as they aren't tied down by legacy tech stacks that must be compatible with on-premise infrastructure, Posey said.PayPal is one such example. The payments giant announced in May that it would expand its partnership with Google Cloud to help the company process transactional data at scale, tapping both its infrastructure and analytics capabilities. Another draw for companies working with Google Cloud is its explicit approach to integrating its partners' capabilities into Google Cloud's ecosystem and supply chain through a joint-selling framework. Google Cloud, for example, recently added PayPal as a payment method for Google Ads and Google Workspace.To be sure, other providers deploy similar tactics, like AWS' marketplace of software vendors and Microsoft Azure's partner ecosystem.IBMTop strength: A hybrid approach with a baked-in regulatory frameworkIBM occupies a different space in the public cloud market, as the tech giant is leaning on a hybrid approach versus a complete migration, Posey said. The hybrid model, in which certain systems and data remain on-prem while others migrate to the cloud, makes IBM an attractive option for bulge-bracket banks that operate under stringent regulations, which vary among countries and evolve over time, she added.                                         Howard Boville, senior vice president for IBM's hybrid cloud.                                                                                        IBM                                                        On Wall Street, retail and commercial banks are more reluctant to adopt cloud tech thanks to stricter regulations compared with investment banks and hedge funds, Posey added. Banks have been slow to move core systems and sensitive customer data off premises.                                                      IBM worked with Bank of America to create its finance-specific offering, which publicly launched in April. Industry regulatory bodies were also involved in helping the tech giant with development, and its acquisition of cybersecurity software provider Spanugo strengthened its technical framework, according to an April 2021 report from 451 Research. That said, Bank of America was a main driver of the cloud's regulatory rigor. The bank had stiffer requirements than what IBM had seen from regulators, and the two firms created more than 400 management controls during the development period, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna previously told Insider. ""What they do is take some of the work off the customers' hands in regard to compliance and staying up to date with regulations and data protections, data privacy, and data sovereignty,"" Posey said. Plus, IBM's enterprise technology business, unlike some of its competitors, precedes the public cloud, Posey added.IBM already has a pool of existing customers that have previously installed its hardware and software. The tech giant is a natural fit to help firms migrate part of that tech into the cloud. In the past four years, IBM has focused its efforts on businesses looking to have hybrid IT environments, compared with those looking to go all-in on the public cloud, she said.Microsoft AzureTop strength: Connectivity with enterprise IT and technology from partner ecosystemMicrosoft Azure's key selling point is its interoperability, both with its existing IT offerings and services, as well as its partners'. As another public cloud provider with a built-in enterprise customer base — from operating systems to productivity applications — ""Azure is a natural choice for organizations who have a big installed base of Microsoft in their IT environment already,"" Posey said. The tech firm spun out its own finance-dedicated cloud in March, with a common data model that enables users to integrate existing services, like Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, with cloud-native ones.New capabilities Microsoft introduced via its financial-services cloud include a loan manager that automates front- and back-office lending processes, self-service tools for retail customer onboarding, and artificial intelligence that continuously learns changing fraud patterns. ""Each of these capabilities is composable, meaning they can be deployed one at a time or in groups,"" Bill Borden, corporate vice president of worldwide financial services at Microsoft, said at an event in March. Morgan Stanley is the latest bank to tap Microsoft, in a bid to boost scalability and compute power, the bank's head of tech told Insider in June. The bank maintains a multi-cloud approach, upholding existing deals with AWS, Google Cloud and IBM, though it dubbed Microsoft its lead partner. Capital One, JPMorgan, and Bank of Montreal are other top-tier banks using Microsoft Azure.Microsoft's partner ecosystem also benefits from the underlying interoperability of Microsoft's cloud-based and traditional IT offerings.The partner ecosystem includes core providers Fiserv, Finastra and Temenos, automation platform BluePrism, and payments giant ACI Worldwide. The built-in network is a ""key factor in its delivery of cloud services for the financial sector"" as the software vendors support cloud deployment and migration and service management, according to the October 2020 report from 451 Research.  ",2021-06-15

Neha Narula, the director of MIT’s Digital Currency Project, explained to the committee the benefits of a digital dollar, describing the U.S. electronic payment system as suffering from “high fees and limited access” because it has  not evolved fast enough to keep pace with the demand for online digital payments.   Narula, whose group is collaborating with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to  study a potential Fed-backed digital dollar,  added that while private cryptocurrencies may evolve to solve these problems, they also present risks including “the immaturity of the technology and its ability to provide widely available, highly secure and scalable payment transactions.”  That’s why, according to Narula, that dozens of central banks across the globe, including the European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China, are experimenting with digital forms of their own currencies.

A digital dollar has the potential to protect the financial privacy in a way that private companies do not, he said. Democratic Rep. Al Lawson of Florida asked the panel to explain to him how a digital dollar could improve Americans’ access to financial services, given that  tens of millions of U.S. citizens lack access to broadband internet. Rohan Grey, assistant professor of law at Willamette University, assured the congressman that a digital dollar could be designed in a way that one would not need an internet connection to access it. Grey pointed to his work with Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and  Pramila Jayapal of Washington to promote legislation that would have authorized the dissemination debit cards to all Americans, funded directly by the Treasury Department, in order to provide monthly COVID-relief money. “We created an emergency responder corps to would deliver prepaid debit cards to people’s doors,” Grey said. “And it’s that kind of critical human infrastructure… that’s going to be really important not only to ensure that people can use a digital currency, but that they are educated, and that they are involved in the deliberation process for its design.”  Some Republicans, like Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri, expressed worry that China’s recent launch of pilot programs to study the impact of digital yuan, could threaten the dominance of the U.S dollar.  Jonathan Dharmapalan, founder and CEO of eCurrency, a company that provides support to central banks that are developing digital currency, argued that China’s digital yuan could eventually reduce demand for the U.S. dollar for cross-border transactions.  “Little by little it could creep into other countries besides China and succeeding in achieving what China really wants for its mercantile payments: that mercantile payments should take place using the Chinese yuan,” he said. Democrats have historically been more supportive of a central-bank digital currency than Republicans, in addition to Tliab and Jayapal’s bill introduced last year, the idea also won the support of  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. He also proposed legislation to create individual accounts at the Federal Reserve in order to directly deposit COVID relief funds. In March, he issued another statement calling on the Fed to redouble its efforts to create a digital dollar.     ",2021-06-15

RELATED: Meet the internet sleuths tracking down the January 6 insurrectionists         Democrats on the committee pressed FBI Director Christopher Wray and two Army officials about the response to the January 6 insurrection – including the time it took for Guard officials to respond to the unfolding attack – during the committee’s latest hearing on the riot. The committee released documents and a timeline ahead of the hearing that found then-acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller had authorized the National Guard to “re-mission” to the Capitol at 4:32 p.m. on January 6 and they did not arrive until 5:20 p.m.             UNITED STATES - APRIL 26: Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., participates in a press conference on medical cannabis research reform on Thursday, April 26, 2018.   Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call Group/Getty Images     A former GOP congressman was part of the crowd outside the US Capitol on January 6           “That response took far too long,” House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said at the hearing. “After a series of delays, the National Guard did not arrive until 5:20 p.m., more than four hours after the Capitol perimeter was breached. This is a shocking failure.”            The New York Democrat also pressed Wray over the FBI’s intelligence about threats ahead of January 6, as well as referrals that the conservative social media site Parler had made to the FBI ahead of January 6 about the prospect of violence. The company sent the committee a letter in March saying that it had referred violent content from its platform to the FBI 50 times ahead of January 6.           “The threats, I would say, were everywhere,” Maloney said. “The Norfolk Field FBI office notified your office. The Washington Post and other newspapers were writing about it. It was on radio, it was on television, it was on other social media streams. The system was blinking red.”           “I do not recall hearing about this particular email, certainly not before January 6,” Wray responded. “I’m not aware of Parler ever trying to contact my office.”               Fox News     Fact-checking Sen. Ron Johnson's continued efforts to mislead on Covid-19 and January 6 insurrection           Wray noted that the FBI did release intelligence products about threats ahead of January 6, though he acknowledged that anytime there’s an attack on the scale of the Capitol insurrection it was “unacceptable.”           The two Army officials who testified Tuesday – Army staff director Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt and Gen. Charles Flynn, commanding general of US Army Pacific and the brother of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn – said the delay in deploying the Guard to the Capitol was the result of having to develop a plan for them to go to the Capitol and obtain proper armor after they were originally deployed for unarmed traffic control.           Piatt and Flynn testified that on a call with DC and Capitol officials, Piatt had explained that he was not denying a request for support as the officials believed but said he had to wait for an answer from Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. In the meantime, they said, they put together a plan for the response.            Piatt acknowledged there had been a delay in the time it took to respond, but argued that time was needed to redeploy the Guard members.           “Now when people’s lives on the lines, two minutes is too long,” Piatt said. “We were not positioned to respond to that urgent request. We had to re-prepare so we would send them in prepared for this new mission.”           Republicans on the committee criticized Maloney for holding another hearing on the attack without testimony from acting Capitol Police Chief Yolanda Pittman, who had declined to appear at Tuesday’s hearing. Maloney said Pittman had agreed to testify before the panel next month.            Republicans accused Democrats of trying to score political points with the hearing, while a handful of Republicans questioned Wray about the treatment of those arrested in the insurrection, alleging that some of those arrested had been let into the building by Capitol Police.           “Sadly, today’s hearing shows Democrats continue to prioritize politics over the American people,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the panel’s top Republican, who argued the committee should instead hold hearings on the US-Mexico border or the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.           Democrats shot back that Republicans were trying to whitewash the events of January 6. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, compared the attempts to change the subject to a “razzle-dazzle” routine.          FBI can’t rule out foreign support for rioters         Wray testified that he cannot rule out that foreign actors funded extremists leading up to the insurrection and that the agency is “very focused on the interplay between different types of … nonstate actors overseas, and domestic terrorists here in the United States.”            Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, highlighted that Nick Fuentes, the self-proclaimed leader of a White supremacist group called Groypers, was wired a quarter of a million dollars in Bitcoin from a French donor prior to January 6. Krisnamoorthi cited news reports that Fuentes and members of the hate group had attended the insurrection.             “Not only would I not want to rule it out, but certainly the possibility of foreign funding or support for domestic violent extremism is something that’s particularly high on our priority list because of the challenges it poses … using Bitcoin. Certainly that’s part of the concern,” Wray said in response.     This story has been updated with further developments.     CNN’s Nicholas Neville contributed to this report.  ",2021-06-15

A wealthy Chinese-Canadian businessman has agreed to forfeit more than $70 million by cutting a record-breaking deal with the New Zealand police.Three years ago, the bank accounts of Xiao Hua Gong in New Zealand were frozen as part of a global investigation into his finances.The businessman had built a business empire in Toronto including a hotel chain and television channels, as well as attending fundraisers for Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and donating to the governing Liberal Party.But the entrepreneur, better known as Edward Gong, was then forced to deny his success and influence was gained from an alleged $202 million pyramid scheme selling medicines in China.He was arrested in Canada and charged with fraud and money laundering in December 2017 in connection to the alleged pyramid scheme involving the ""fraudulent sale of hundreds of millions of dollars"" in shares in China.The Asset Recovery Unit of the New Zealand Police were also involved in investigating $77m - alleged profits from the pyramid scheme - deposited into Gong's New Zealand bank accounts over seven years.Nine months before Gong's arrest in Canada, a High Court judge granted freezing orders over Gong's assets in New Zealand which include $69.5m held in bank accounts and an Auckland home worth $2m.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Those assets were restrained under the Criminal Proceeds Recovery Act, which essentially forces someone to prove how an asset was paid for.For the asset to be forfeited, the police still have to prove criminal offending took place but only on the ""balance of probabilities"", the level of proof necessary in civil cases, not the much higher criminal threshold of ""beyond reasonable doubt"".Related articlesNew Zealand'Meth easier to buy than milk' - Emails to NZ's top cop led to downfall of Mob boss13 Feb 04:00 PMNew Zealand|CrimeAppeal lost over frozen $17.5 million of alleged dirty money26 Nov 01:44 AMBusinessMasala boss remains behind bars for tax evasion and money laundering22 Sep 05:36 AMNew ZealandRevealed: Identity of farmer charged with alleged $16m tax fraud22 Aug 05:00 PMGong has previously said the evidence used against him in China was gathered by coercion.Despite this, Gong has cut a deal with the New Zealand Police, where he has agreed to forfeit more than $70m instead of fighting the case in the High Court.In a statement released by Police National Headquarters today, Detective Inspector Craig Hamilton said the forfeiture was the largest ever under the criminal proceeds law.He thanked Chinese and Canadian authorities, and said the case showed New Zealand was capable of investigating complex alleged money laundering cases involving multiple jurisdictions.""We are committed to making our country the hardest place for criminals to do business, and we will not tolerate those who operate in other parts of the world hiding their illicit proceeds here,"" said Hamilton, the national supervisor for the police asset recovery units.""This outcome sends a simple message to criminals around the world — send your dirty money to New Zealand and you will lose it.""AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The announcement comes shortly after an international report on money laundering rated the New Zealand police as among the best in the world at seizing criminal profits.The success of the police in enforcing the Criminal Proceeds Recovery Act was ""impressive"", according to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) based in Paris, as more than $1 billion in alleged criminal wealth has been frozen since the powerful law came into effect just over a decade ago.Edward Gong, seen far left, at a fundraising dinner with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Photo / Jason OxenhamWilliam Yan, better known as Bill Liu, also agreed to a settlement without any ""admission of criminal or civil liability"" after his New Zealand assets were frozen in 2014 following allegations of fraud in China.As part of the unusual civil deal, and despite his ongoing protest of innocence, Yan also agreed to return to China to stand trial on fraud charges on which he was convicted.He then returned to New Zealand to plead guilty to a single money laundering charge - which was also part of the settlement - and served five months' home detention in his Metropolis penthouse apartment.He now lives in Hong Kong.The Gong and Yan settlements are easily the two largest successful forfeitures under the asset seizure law so far.Another case, also involving New Zealand police helping overseas law enforcement, involves the restraint of $140m in a bank account of a New Zealand company linked to a Russian ""computer genius"".Alexander Vinnik was arrested while on holiday in Greece in 2017 and extradited to France last year, where he was convicted of laundering millions of Euros for cyber criminals.He was sentenced to five years in prison in France, and now faces the possibility of being extradited to the United States on further charges connected to BTC-e, where at least $4 billion worth of bitcoin was traded with ""high levels of anonymity"".While the exchange of bitcoin is entirely legitimate, prosecutors from the US Department of Justice allege Vinnik created a customer base for BTC-e that was ""heavily reliant on criminals"" by not requiring users to validate their identity, obscure and anonymise transactions and the source of funds, and lacked any anti-money-laundering processes.Alexander Vinnik has been convicted of money laundering in France and the United States want to extradite him on other criminal charges. Photo / Getty ImagesIf the forfeiture action taken against Vinnik in New Zealand is successful, it means the three biggest cases - $250m combined - under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009 involve the wealth of alleged criminals overseas being moved to New Zealand.In the past, the law has most often been used to seize wealth accumulated by gangs and drug dealers but has pushed into new territory in recent years.There have been a number of cases involving fraud or alleged tax evasion, alleged movie piracy and cryptocurrency, foreign corruption, and even a workplace fatality.SaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail",2021-06-15

Sign in  You are logged in   Switch accounts    With the regulator signalling that it’s prepared to go after even more of the exchanges, there are perfectly sound strategic reasons for the crackdown, even if enforcing any judgments is a long shot at best, says Jean-Paul Bureaud, executive director of Fair Canada, an investors rights group.          ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW                       ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             “This really isn’t about collecting fines. There are other ways to make investors safe,” said Bureaud.Bureaud suggested that the OSC has three main goals in mind as it cracks down: Making potential customers hesitate, sending a message to Canadian-based exchanges which aren’t playing by the rules, and being enough of a nuisance to offshore cyber-exchanges that they give up on trying to sell to Canadians.“Raising awareness of the risks, and bringing some of the legitimate ones into the regulatory system are both helpful when it comes to protecting investors,” said Bureaud.On May 25, the OSC charged Seychelles-based Poloniex with breaking securities regulations by trading securities without registration, not complying with prospectus disclosure requirements, and engaging in activity “contrary to the public interest.” Last week, the OSC charged Singapore-based PhoenixFin Pte Ltd. and Seychelles-based Mek Global Ltd. with similar offences, saying that the two companies run the KuCoin cryptoexchange.The moves came after the OSC issued a March warning to cryptocurrency exchanges that they needed to follow securities regulations if they wanted to keep selling to Ontario investors. In a press release announcing the Poloniex charges, the OSC said 70 of the exchanges have since initiated “compliance” discussions with the OSC and other Canadian regulators. Just one exchange — controlled by online brokerage Wealthsimple — has come up with a full compliance plan blessed by the OSC.

That’s something that the OSC is probably hoping will happen as part of this,” said Burgoyne, a partner at Calgary-based McLeod Law, who runs the firm’s cryptocurrency practice.          ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             If the OSC is persistent enough, Burgoyne argued, some firms may simply decide not to accept any investments from Canadian customers, choosing to “geoblock” access to their apps or websites.Andreas Park, a finance professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Business, agreed that there’s a method to the OSC’s crackdown madness.“It sends a message to Canadian investors that it’s not a good idea to put your money into these exchanges. And it sends a message to these companies: ‘If you’re accepting money from Canadians, we’re going to be a pain in the ass to you unless you comply with our regulations,’” said Park.In early May, OSC chair Grant Vingoe, in a speech to the Canadian Club, said the sheer scale and pace of cryptocurrency investment was cause for concern.“In January of this year, global crypto asset market capitalization reached $1 trillion (U.S.) for the first time. Then, in April — just 94 days later — it reached $2 trillion. By way of comparison, that’s larger than the assets under management of all Canadian mutual fund and ETF holdings,” Vingoe said in his speech.  ",2021-06-15

Ensuring transactions are near instant and completely secure is essential for crypto adoption on a worldwide scale. The scalability that the Lightning Network brings to the blockchain is pivotal to moving this technology away from being used as a traditional investment and more as a type of fiat currency. In the last few weeks since El Salvador announced Bitcoin as legal tender, Bitrefill announced that on multiple occasions they processed over 10,000 daily transactions. This high number of transactions on the LN saved nearly 2 blocks on-chain.

""My newsroom kind of groups everyone into racial groups.""Lee Meier, an assistant news director at KRIV, is heard saying: ""It's not just about the viewers; it's about what our CEO reads; it's about what our GM reads.""""I have passed on Bitcoin stories ... Bitcoin for poor African American audience at 5, it's probably not going to play. That's a choice I'm making. An editorial choice,"" Meier says in the video.""That seems like sort of a racially charged statement to make,"" says O'Keefe. ""I want out of this narrative news-telling,"" Hecker responds. ""I want out of this corruption ... I'm so horrified at what the news business has stooped to.""In one story, Hecker says she was sent to a hospital to find out how they're treating COVID-19 and Dr. Joseph Varon, chief of critical care at United Memorial Medical Center confirms his use of hydroxychloroquine.""We have used it. I mean, we know it's a drug that has been politicized up to the wazoo. We've used it. We use it with good success,"" he tells Hecker.""You need to cease and desist posting about hydroxychloroquine,"" KRIV vice president and news director Susan Schiller tells Hecker in the video. ""In my opinion, you failed as a reporter.""Schiller points to a New England Journal of Medicine study that disparages hydroxychloroquine, and Hecker counters that she read it, and that it caused her to deem the remarks by doctors who use it as more newsworthy, not less.A Project Veritas reporter is also seen confronting Fox 26 photographer David Lanier, asking him, ""How come you guys, like, are the all-vaccine, all-the-time channel?""""We hire producers, which are the ones that write the show, that are right out of college,"" says Lanier. ""They just regurgitate what they are fed.""Other KRIV employees are also shown in the video lamenting that the station pushes COVID-19 vaccine stories but doesn't allow stories about potential side effects, and that advertisers have sway over editorial content.  James O'Keefe, left, of Project Veritas interviews local Fox reporter Ivory Hecker, who claims her Houston station censored her. Courtesy of James O'Keefe and Project Veritas. In a very unusual move, Hecker announced on-air Monday that she had the recordings and that she shared them with Project Veritas, which released them Tuesday, along with a video interview with O'Keefe.""I want to let you, the viewers, know that Fox Corp has been muzzling me to keep certain information from you, the viewers,"" Hecker said Monday. ""And from what I'm gathering I am not the only reporter being subjected to this. I am going to be releasing some recordings about what goes on behind the scenes at Fox because it applies to you, the viewers.""Hecker told Newsweek on Monday that her dispute with Fox ""had taken a dark turn last August"" after interviewing an unspecified person, and that she was told to keep silent about opposing ""censorship"" months later.""They decided they didn't like what the interview subject had said, and they went on to internally harass and defame me,"" Hecker said. ""I knew I was not working for a journalistic organization when I was called into an HR meeting in December and was told to keep my support for free speech and opposition to censorship to myself—that those were not matters to be publicly spoken about.""The Fox local news stations are separate from the Fox News Channel, though owned by the same parent company, Fox Corporation, which did not respond to a request for comment, though Hecker has reportedly been fired for her stunt as a whistle-blower, according to The Daily Beast.""FOX 26 adheres to the highest editorial standards of accuracy and impartiality. This incident involves nothing more than a disgruntled former employee seeking publicity by promoting a false narrative produced through selective editing and misrepresentation,"" a KRIV spokesperson told Newsweek.Hecker also goes after the parent company when she says in the video that ""Fox came at my throat for standing up against censorship.

He has undoubtedly been one of the most successful entrepreneurs in recent history.And although he already has his hands full as the CEO of electric car company Tesla and aerospace manufacturer SpaceX, he seems to have time to pick up one more title - Twitter troll and violator of corporate disclosure laws.Musk has gotten in trouble with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) multiple times. In 2019, Musk agreed to a deal with regulators to a US$20 million fine that also called for Tesla’s lawyers to “pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company”. READ: Commentary: Don’t be too quick to write-off Elon Musk The settlement follows the SEC investigation of Musk tweeting about taking the company private at a price of US$420 per share, a number the SEC said is allegedly inspired by the price of marijuana. Such an announcement would be a major corporate event for a publicly-listed company, yet it was tweeted without pre-approval from his board of directors.In spite of the SEC settlement, he has continued to let loose a stream of tweets, which have sent both Tesla and cryptocurrencies on a rollercoaster ride. He also has a well-known disdain of financial regulators, and has been quoted stating “I want to be clear, I do not respect the SEC.”But whether Musk respects regulators is irrelevant. He should still be subject to the same set of financial regulations that everyone else is held up to. So how is it that Musk still has free reign over his social media account? What drives this boldness? People – his followers – give him power. Both retail and institutional investors appear to react to Musk’s tweets about the market, be it due to religious zeal for him or a rational analysis of future Tesla’s corporate policy.After the announcement of Tesla’s purchase of bitcoin, its price skyrocketed. Tesla reported its quarterly profit through March 2021 from sales of bitcoin of over US$100 million.Take the case of Musk’s tweeting that the Tesla stock was too high on 1 May 2020. The tweet prompted a US$13 billion decline in the Tesla’s market value. The fact that the stock price later recovered to greater heights is no consolation. READ: Commentary: Don’t trust the hype – Bitcoin will never be a wise investment  If anything, it raises the question of whether Musk purposely manipulated the stock price down in anticipation of future good news, representing a buying opportunity for himself and those he may wish to let in on the deal.SHOULD REGULATORS STEP IN?One question that comes up is whether investors are unwitting participants in a market manipulation scheme? And if so, what can regulators do about it?The issue at hand is about equity (the concept, not the financial instrument). READ: Commentary: What if another widespread Internet outage happens? Regulation on corporate insiders is in place for a reason. As these insiders have access to corporate information that others do not have, their words in non-official channels could lead to large effects on the stock price and an unfair advantage for some.It turns out that they do not need new rules for tweeting. They just need to enforce existing regulations better.Musk said that he started SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX for the betterment of humanity, but his tweets that affect the financial well-being of stock market participants can hardly be said to achieve the same purpose. Billions of dollars of investments hinge on whether a tweet has a happy emoji or sad emoji. That is a lot of risk.What makes Elon Musk special as an influencer, compared to the likes of Justin Bieber, is that he is a corporate insider. He is privy to inside information, while the other type of influencers only use public information. Unlike the latter, the economic consequences of trolling by corporate insiders is far more serious.If we believe this has wide-ranging implications, then we should consider whether to allow markets to correct mistruths or more aggressively enforce Musk’s violations of corporate disclosure policy.THE CASE FOR LESS REGULATIONGiving to less regulator activity means permitting arbitrary corporate disclosure while relying on financial incentives of market participants to “correct any mistruth”.One way to do that operationally is for regulators to reduce short-sale constraints (i.e. restraining the sale of stock that the seller does not own). Currently, investors can correct underpriced stocks by buying, but face restrictions when trying to bet against stocks they think are overpriced. READ: Commentary: GameStop insanity has painful lessons on short-selling and more for retail investors For example, when Musk tweets that he is taking Tesla private at a high company valuation and its share price rises, market participants who are suspicious of such behavior are financially incentivised to find out whether that is true.If they think the statement is false, they can short-sell the stock to bet against the event and profit from being correct. Restricting the ability of short-sellers to bet against the stock reduces market participants’ ability to correct overoptimistic beliefs.Academic research has shown that short-sale constraints increase stock mispricing and the probability of a stock price crash, as unsustainable market expectations unravel in the future.But given the public perception of short-sellers, reducing short-sale constraints doesn’t appear to be a viable option. Since the 1930s, the US SEC has taken the stance that short-sellers may manipulate markets.Moreover, in times of financial crises and illiquidity, prices may overreact to bad news and plummet further than their fundamental value.It doesn’t help that movies like The Big Short portray short-sellers betting against the US housing market as anti-heroes. In fact, the GameStop and AMC saga originated from retailer investors’ desires to take on short-sellers.(If none of what happened with GameStop made sense to you, listen to financial veterans break down how different players powered the surge and which listed company could see copycat attacks in CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.)CASE FOR MORE ENFORCEMENTThe other alternative is to enforce existing financial regulations more stringently. Importantly, this solution does not call for more financial regulation and should be politically easy to enact.Given existing rules on short sales, no reasonable free-market advocate would accept allowing corporate insiders to take advantage of their position to spread misinformation or unverified numbers.So the most practical approach would be for regulators to step in and apply the rule of law. The very essence of this is that everyone should play by the same rules. Whether it is tweets on bitcoin or Tesla, Musk should be subject to the same set of financial regulations that are imposed on all CEOs and corporate insiders. READ: Commentary: The fratboy folly of Elon Musk, self-anointed Technoking The SEC has admonished Musk for allegedly violating the terms of the previous settlement agreement, but has yet to file a motion to compel enforcement. It’s not clear why.Given the lack of SEC enforcement and Musk’s recent tweets, the decentralised hacktivist group Anonymous has considered taking matters in their own vigilante hands.In a four-minute video, the group states that Musk was “constantly trolling” and that “millions of retail investors were really counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives ... Of course, they took the risk upon themselves when they invested, and everyone knows to be prepared for volatility in crypto, but your tweets this week show a clear disregard for the average working person.”Whether Anonymous will employ more dramatic efforts to stop Elon Musk from tweeting raises another concern: Cybersecurity breaches. Concentrating public opinion, market sentiment, or information flow to a handful of sources raises the question of whether influential nodes in information or social networks may be hijacked.Indeed, a quick Twitter search reveals numerous fake Elon Musk accounts touting various cryptocurrency scams, and the Federal Trade Commission reports that these impersonators stole more than US$ 2 million over the past six months alone.The failure of the SEC to enforce their own agreement with Musk so far raises concern that frustrated participants and other actors may take it upon themselves to affect a change.Ben Charoenwong is an assistant professor of finance at the National University of Singapore Business School.

He also advises clients on Securities and Exchange Commission and corporate governance matters, the firm said. Sibbitt, who works with blockchain and cryptocurrency clients, is the latest fintech leader to hop firms this year. Several firms made big hires in January, including Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough's hire of Polsinelli fintech leader Richard Levin, White & Case's addition of Milbank practice group head Douglas Landy, and Cooley's hire of Morrison & Foerster fintech co-chairs Obrea Poindexter and Sean Ruff. Los Angeles-based Paul Hastings made a similar hire to expand its capital markets and fintech and payments practice groups last year when it brought on New York-partner Christopher Austin, who previously served as co-head of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe's capital markets practice. ""As blockchain and cryptocurrency become more and more mainstream, companies in this innovative space are seeking top legal counsel to help them navigate their convergence with more traditional financial institutions and Main Street companies,"" Seth Zachary, chairman of Paul Hastings, said in a statement Tuesday. Sibbitt also commented on the trend, citing an ""interesting convergence between what was once what I like to call the wild west of crypto, and kind-of traditional mainstream businesses and financial institutions."" Traditional financial institutions are merging with or acquiring blockchain-related and other fintech companies, and traditional crypto-native companies have now become large companies with significant market capitalization, he said. Sibbitt also noted that fintech work brings opportunities for various practices across large law firms because financial services companies are highly regulated and fintech is a growing industry. Fintech is increasingly ""an engine of activity,"" he said. An O'Melveny spokesperson said the firm wishes Sibbitt well. O'Melveny has also been active on the lateral hiring front, including hiring two technology-focused corporate partners in California on Monday from Cooley and Fox Rothschild. O'Melveny also became the latest law firm to open an office in Austin last week, with a team from Thompson & Knight.

Buterin said that there had been several internal team conflicts in the past five years and as a result, he confirmed that Ethereum 2.0 launch is unlikely to occur before late 2022.In a May 22 report from Goldman Sachs, analysts said that Ether (ETH) has a “high chance of overtaking Bitcoin as a dominant store of value.” Furthermore, the report noted the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and the nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystems being built on Ethereum. Coincidentally, on the very next day, Ether’s price bottomed at $1,750.On Monday, CoinShares released its weekly fund flows report, and Ether investment products had the largest outflows, totaling $12.7 million. However, the upcoming $1.5-billion options expiry on June 25 could be a turning point for Ether, according to Cointelegraph. This figure is 30% larger than the March 26 expiry, which took place as Ether’s price plunged 17% in five days and bottomed near $1,550.Despite flirting with $2,600 after a 12% rally over the past week, top Ether traders seem unable to change their neutral-to-bearish positioning according to derivatives data.The three-month futures premium is neutral-to-bearishNormally, ETH three-month futures usually trade at a premium to regular spot exchanges. In addition to the exchange liquidity risk, the seller is postponing settlement and usually charges more.The 6%–17% annualized return on stablecoin lending indicates bullishness whenever the three-month premium trades above that range. On the other hand, when futures are trading below the stablecoin lending rate, it is a signal of short-term bearish sentiment.Huobi ETH Sept. futures premium vs. spot market. Source: TradingViewAs shown above, the 8% premium — 26% annualized — vanished on May 13, indicating extreme optimism. Since then, it has been ranging near 2.8%, which is equivalent to 10% annualized. Thus, top traders are neutral-to-bearish according to this indicator as it nears the lower level of the expected range.The options skew shows moderate signs of fearThe 25% delta skew compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when the protective put options premium is trading higher. Whenever this metric surpasses 10%, it is considered a “fear” indicator.The opposite holds when market makers are bullish, and this causes the 25% delta skew indicator to enter the negative range.Deribit Ethereum options 25% delta skew. Source: laevitas.chFrom May 20 to June 8, the indicator stood near 10%, indicating a higher protective put premium, which is usually a “fear” indicator. However, over the last week, it has slightly improved to 7%, which is within the “neutral” range but still close to bearish sentiment.There is no evidence of bullish growth in top traders’ confidence as Ether tests the $2,600 resistance. So, until those indicators flip to neutral-to-bullish, traders should act with extreme care before concluding that a bull run is in place.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

From Environmental Working Gr… [+7968 chars]",Activistpost.com,"By B.N. Frank Companies continue to be exposed for putting toxic ingredients in beauty and healthcare products. But formaldehyde in hair straighteners and treatments?! From Environmental Working Group:  WASHINGTON – Salon workers from around the U.S. today joined the Environmental Working Group and Women’s Voices for the Earth to petition the Food and Drug Administration to ban dangerous hair straighteners that contain formaldehyde. The petition outlines the well-documented health hazards of exposure to formaldehyde in hair-straightening products – often known as keratin treatments, or by the name of one prominent brand, Brazilian Blowout. Solutions containing liquid formaldehyde are applied to hair, which is then heated with blow dryers and straightening irons, causing the release of formaldehyde into the air, endangering not only stylists but their clients. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen and potent allergen. The petition argues that its presence in hair-straightening and -smoothing treatments means that under the federal Drug and Cosmetics Act, such products are “adulterated” and should be banned.      “The FDA regulates chemicals at a glacial pace, even when it knows they cause harm,” said Melanie Benesh, EWG’s legislative attorney. Since at least 2008, the agency has known about the health hazards associated with these hair-straightening products and has yet to regulate formaldehyde, failing to protect stylists and their clients.” “Salon workers have particularly suffered with symptoms associated with these products, with many reporting long-term health problems,” said Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research for Women’s Voices for the Earth. “The health risks posed by these products deserved immediate action from the FDA when brought to the agency’s attention in 2008. Allowing salon workers and their customers to continue to be harmed by these products for more than a decade is unconscionable.” Salon workers have reported that the application of formaldehyde hair treatments has caused difficulty breathing, eye irritation and nosebleeds. These injuries – in addition to rashes, blistering and hair loss – are associated with formaldehyde exposure. In 2020, California passed a law that will ban formaldehyde from hair straighteners sold in the state by 2025. In May, Maryland passed a similar law that will take effect in January 2025. Timeline: The FDA’s failure to regulate ‘Brazilian blowout’ hair treatment The FDA and cosmetics industry have known for more than 10 years that keratin hair-smoothing treatments emit unsafe levels of formaldehyde – here’s what they knew and when. Click here “It’s clear: Formaldehyde should not be allowed in these products,” said Amber Garcia, executive director of WVE. “While California’s and Maryland’s laws are a significant step in eliminating this harmful exposure, what we need to truly protect salon workers is a national ban and overall stronger cosmetics regulation. We are calling on the agency in charge of cosmetic safety, which is supposed to protect the public from these harmful exposures, to remove these ingredients from the shelves for good.” “The larger problem remains that laws governing what companies can put into products are broken,” added Garcia. “Salon professionals are repeatedly exposed to numerous toxic chemicals in the workplace, in solvents, polishes, straighteners, dyes and other beauty care products containing known allergens, carcinogens or neurological and developmental toxicants. “People trust that the products they are using are regulated and safe, but that simply isn’t the case,” they said. “Policy changes need to be made so cancer-causing chemicals like formaldehyde aren’t allowed in the product in the first place. In the meantime, the FDA must move forward in banning this toxic ingredient.” Nations and states, including Canada, France, Ireland, California, Maryland and Oregon, have removed products with dangerous levels of formaldehyde from store shelves. In 2010, under then-Attorney General Kamala Harris, California sued Brazilian Blowout for deceptive advertising and failure to warn consumers of the presence of formaldehyde. In 2012, a settlement required Brazilian Blowout to include warnings on product labels about the release of formaldehyde gas and pay civil penalties. In 2011, EWG first petitioned the FDA, insisting that the agency investigate the products and take appropriate action. After the FDA neglected to act or respond to the petition, in 2016 EWG and WVE sued the agency, but the lawsuit was dismissed on procedural grounds. That same year, FDA scientists determined that using formaldehyde in hair straighteners was unsafe, and the agency started to take steps to ban the chemical. But for reasons that remain unclear, the FDA never followed through with a ban.     In 2017, the FDA issued a partial denial of the citizen petition by declining EWG’s request to require warning labels on hair-straightening products containing formaldehyde. The agency promised to continue investigating whether it should regulate formaldehyde but has yet to take action. “The science shows that exposure to formaldehyde is linked to a multitude of health problems, and the FDA has received numerous reports from consumers and workers who have been harmed using these products,” said Benesh. “It’s long past time that the FDA ban this ingredient from hair-smoothing treatments.” *** Media note: Salon workers are available for interviews. Contact Beth Conway at WVE or Monica Amarelo at EWG to arrange interviews.  Quotes from salon workers Emily Baedeker, salon professional in Alameda, Calif.: I suffered from intense migraines every time a keratin treatment was performed at the salon where I was working. I was never taught about the potential harm of the ingredients that are in the products marketed to hairstylists and clients. Once I realized it, I did a ton of research and only then did I learn how much these chemicals were putting my health at risk. It blew my mind because I always thought the purpose of the FDA was to protect us from harm. Now I can’t work in a salon with other stylists because I have no control over the products they use. I find that most of the mainstream brands used in salons contain chemicals known to cause harm. Women are told they need to change their appearance to be more attractive and then the products we are expected to use to obtain these beauty ideals are literally making us sick. And salon workers are the most at risk. Most salon workers are underpaid, overworked and don’t have medical benefits. Our jobs are making us sick and we don’t even know it. It’s a huge problem that is disproportionately affecting women and people of color. Kristi Ramsburg, a professional stylist in Wilmington, N.C.:           I used to specialize in straight hair treatments and have been plagued with health issues, from short-term to long-term problems. Within the last four years I have had my gall bladder, ovaries, tubes and appendix removed. The week before my latest health attack – which included stomach pain, vomiting, nausea and fluid retention – I had done four straightening services with keratin products. I try to spend no longer than necessary in the salon. I spend any breaks or processing outside whenever possible. Something more has got to be done. The FDA must do more to protect workers like me. ### The Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.

Click here to find out more Â»    dima_zel/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroduction Many investors and analysts have been looking at Voyager Digital (OTCQB:VYGVF) with cautious optimism, tying Voyagerâs growth to an increase in the prices of cryptocurrencies, essentially making Voyager Digital a crypto momentum stock. Many analysts and investors erroneously conflate the price of Bitcoin with the value of Voyagerâs stock. I believe that this correlation is an overly simplistic and misguided interpretation of Voyagerâs value. I believe that, in part, this is partially because the bullish case for Voyager has never been laid out in its entirety. In this article, I will lay out the case for why this cautious optimism has caused investors to improperly price Voyagerâs growth and future potential creating an opportunity for investors to buy into a fundamentally new type of fintech company. Thesis Voyager is a new breed of fintech company. With unprecedented growth in a rapidly accelerating industry with massive TAM (Total Addressable Market) of over $120 trillion in investable assets (Voyager June 2021 Investor Presentation), investors and analysts are struggling to keep up with and understand the new reality that Voyager and cryptocurrencies are just beginning to usher in. Investors who are bearish or cautiously optimistic about Voyager are fundamentally missing the growth story for fintech, crypto and Voyager itself. Because of this, the market has not priced in the bullish case for Voyager creating an opportunity for investors if the growth story plays out. I believe that any short-term slowdown in crypto growth pales in comparison with the multi-decade macro trajectory that the industry, crypto, and Voyager are on. The Fundamentals Before we delve into the entirety of the bullish case it is important to understand the fundamentals of Voyager. Taking a look at the Company's Financials (which can be found on SEDAR), Voyager has a strong balance sheet with over $72m in cash and over $2.68b in assets and $2.58b in liabilities (majority being payables to customers) as of March 2021. As we will see, these numbers are likely understating the companyâs current fundamental value as the most recent AUM number is $3.3b as of April, just one month after the date of these financials. Voyager had approximately 270,000 funded accounts as of March 2021 according to their March Business Update, with the most recent April Business Update placing funded account numbers at 400,000 representing a 48.15% increase. Each funded account produces approximately $100/month in revenue for Voyager according to management guidance so we can reasonably estimate April revenue at $40 million, outpacing the entirety of Voyagerâs third fiscal quarter. Furthermore, the cost of acquisition, per funded account, is approximately $40/account giving Voyager a payback period of less than two weeks upon acquiring a new account. Even assuming zero growth, at $40m/month in revenue Voyager has a run rate of $480m a year in revenue. With a 50% operating margin, that provides a net annualized profit number of $240m. At a 25 price to earnings ratio, arguably low for a company like Voyager in todayâs market, that imputes a valuation in excess of $6 billion. Iâll leave it up to the reader to decide whether or not the current $2.5b valuation is a fair valuation for a company making half a billion a year in revenue and a quarter billion a year in profit. Unpriced Growth Even if one assumes that the company is fairly valued at its fundamentals, the low valuation becomes harder and harder to justify as the growth story continues to unfold. In the June investor deck, management posted a 35% month-over-month user growth estimate, which is lower than the 48% growth in users seen in April. However, extrapolating management's guidance, we get 540,000 funded accounts in March, 729,000 funded accounts in June, and 4.4 million funded accounts by end of year.   Many investors will rightfully point out that it is unlikely that Voyager will continue on a 35% month over a month user growth trajectory, but even if this scenario is unlikely, the possibility that Voyager may have 4-5 million users by the end of the year is entirely unpriced in Voyagerâs current $2.5b valuation. These growth numbers would result in a company that potentially has a $4-$5 billion revenue run rate with upwards of $2 billion in profit, comparable to Coinbase (COIN) that is currently trading at a valuation of $46 billion at the time of writing. Even in a modestly bullish case where the 35% growth rate only lasts through June and growth dramatically slows to 6% per month, Voyager still ends up with over 1 million funded accounts by end of year. At current metrics, that would result in an over $1 billion revenue run rate and half a billion in operating profit at 50% operating margins. Again using our 25 P/E multiple, that gives a very comfortable valuation of $12.5b by the end of the year - and thatâs if growth slows dramatically.   Further Opportunities for Growth in Financial Services Looking at Voyager as a pure-play crypto company is likely to be shortsighted and will miss even further growth opportunities for the business. Today, Voyagerâs revenue of $100/account is primarily driven by spread revenues, but Voyagerâs foray into interest-bearing accounts, which people often forget happened only just six months ago, is already indicative of the direction that the company is heading. According to Bankrate.com, here are the âbestâ savings account rates for June 2021:  âHigh Yieldâ savings accounts today only offer 0.57% APY. In Voyager, with no crypto exposure, you can earn 9% on your cash which is 15x better than the highest yield savings account in the country. With 10,000 VGX, that rate goes up to 10% which is over 17x better! With the launch of Voyagerâs highly anticipated VLP (Voyager Loyalty Program) using the VGX token, this rate will likely be pushed even higher. Furthermore, Voyagerâs interest program actually makes money for the company. By cutting the fat and the middlemen that exist between your cash and your yield, Voyager has already started competing with high-yield savings accounts and has created a profitable model that creates more value for their customers. These offerings are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Voyagerâs expansion into financial services. Management has already discussed far more product expansions that further diversify Voyagerâs business creating a next-generation fintech company. These growth catalysts include:  Stocks Credit/Debit Cards Margin Advisory Services  Voyager potentially represents what a financial services company will look like in the future, or the JP Morgan of tomorrow. These growth catalysts also may give Voyager the opportunity to increase the value of each funded account beyond $100/month to further increase the revenue and profitability of the company. The Voyager Token [VGX] - Overlooked by Analysts Few analysts have attempted to include the Voyager token in their analyses of the company, but the token remains a massive differentiator for Voyager which adds tremendous value and loyalty to customers on the platform. The Voyager community is very engaged, impassioned, and loyal and are valuable brand ambassadors that allow Voyager to continue on its low-cost, high-return acquisition strategy which has made the company highly profitable. In short, the Voyager Token not only creates loyalty, but injects the Voyager brand into the very DNA of the crypto ecosystem (and vice-versa). The highly anticipated launch of the VLP (Voyager Loyalty Program) is poised to be one of the more comprehensive and rewarding loyalty programs in the industry. There is a lot of chatter about the VLP among Voyager's social channels, both official and unofficial, representing customer excitement and anticipation. Just a few examples:    Twitter (82.1k followers)  Unofficial Telegram (1700+ members)  Stocktwits (89.51% bullish at writing)  Reddit (5.9k subscribers)  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) made the choice early on to create its âAmazon Primeâ program which has been hailed by investors as one of the most successful loyalty programs of all time despite the program âlosing moneyâ for Amazon. What early naysayers of Amazon Prime failed to realize is that the increase in customer loyalty, customer engagement, and decrease in customer churn far outstripped the costs of the program. In similar fashion, Voyager may be able to capture this same success by becoming a brand that drives more loyalty, passion, and engagement than their competitors. This represents a big opportunity for Voyager that is largely absent in many of its competitors. Crypto Outlook Many investors are fearful and bearish on cryptocurrencies, which has caused a recent decline in Voyagerâs share price, but the fear is likely short-sighted. Simply put, crypto volatility is Voyagerâs friend. Voyager makes money on volume and volatility - which occurs whether crypto prices go down or up. While a further decline in crypto prices is possible, Voyager will always be able to profit from spread revenues. Furthermore, fixation on short-term crypto prices misses the impact that crypto and blockchain technology is having on the world. When I first entered the crypto space in 2015, the thought that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) would be adopted by countries as legal tender and Ethereum (ETH-USD) would be used to power applications from multi-billion dollar financial protocols to decentralized creator markets was nearly unthinkable. The adoption of crypto technology is unprecedented and the size of the opportunities that will exist in this space are likely to be similar in size to the opportunities that existed in the widespread adoption of the internet. The Apples, Googles, Amazons, Facebooks, of crypto are likely being born today. Pick carefully! While it is unlikely that any given company will end up being ""The Next Google"", the possibility that crypto will revolutionize industry the same way the internet revolutionized our modern world is entirely absent in many analyses. Risks In my opinion, the most pressing risks that Voyager faces are:  Technical infrastructure crumbling under customer demand Contraction in spread revenues Loss of interest in crypto/digital assets    Technical Infrastructure Voyager had several incidents where the platform had to be taken offline including a cyberattack in December. Following the GameStop (GME) frenzy in January, Voyager had an unexpectedly large influx of customers causing downtime and the implementation of a waitlist bottlenecking growth. Voyager's CEO has stated that they are primarily focused on scaling to 10 million users prior to international expansion. Failure to scale the technical infrastructure represents a large risk to Voyager's growth story. Contraction in Spread Revenues Similar to Coinbase, Voyager faces risks in increased competition driving spread revenues down. Voyager's $100/user/month metric is highly dependent upon spread revenues. A contraction in spread revenues would likely result in the revenue/user/month also contracting, making growth projections more muted. This contraction risk illustrates the importance of Voyager continuing to diversify its product offering through more coins and more features to maintain and grow its revenue per user metric. Loss of Interest in Crypto/Digital Assets The contraction in the crypto markets in May through June may have resulted in decreased interest in crypto and digital assets generally. A further decline in crypto asset prices and subsequent interest would likely affect Voyager's ability to maintain current revenue and growth metrics. Conclusion Voyagerâs potential growth, business model, unique tokenomics and brand value is likely not priced into its current $2.5b valuation. The market appears to be pricing in a bearish scenario for Voyager which creates tremendous opportunity for investors should the bullish scenario come to fruition. I believe that the scenario where Voyager hits 1.03m funded accounts by December 2021 is far more likely than what is being priced in by the market. Assuming Voyager maintains the current $100/month revenue metrics at 50% operating margins, this would represent a revenue run rate of $1.03 billion/year with $501.5m in forward-looking operating profit. At a 25 P/E ratio, this would give Voyager a valuation of $12.5 billion representing five-fold increase in the current valuation. With 144.35m shares outstanding, this would imply a stock price of $86.59 USD or $105.58 CAD. Should the bullish scenario play out and Voyager hits 1+ million users by end of year, I place a price target of $105.58 CAD.     ",2021-06-15

Frank Earlier this year, another study confirmed that children living near fracking wells are more vulnerable to health issues.  Of course, it’s not only children who are vulnerable.  What’s happening in one American community serves as a warning to us all. From Mother Jones:  When the Frackers Get Too Close for Comfort America bet big on shale fuels. Now towns like Arlington, Texas, are stuck with the consequences. This story was produced by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting.  (You can sign up for Reveal’s newsletter at revealnews.org/newsletter.)  When Wanda Vincent looks out the windows of her daycare center in Arlington, Texas, past the playground, she sees a row of enormous beige storage tanks. They’re connected to two wells that produce natural gas for Total, one the world’s largest fossil fuel companies. No government agency—city, state or federal—monitors the air here or inspects regularly for emissions. So Vincent has no way of knowing whether dangerous gases are leaking out of all that equipment, potentially harming the children and staff who spend their days so close to those wells.      She feels surrounded. Within two miles of her daycare, 35 wells produce gas at six different sites, most of them operated by TEP Barnett USA, a subsidiary of the French energy giant Total, the dominant gas producer in Arlington. The diverse Dallas suburb of 400,000 has the fortune and misfortune of sitting atop one of the country’s largest onshore natural gas fields, the Barnett Shale. “No one is held accountable to determine whether it’s safe or not, and yet they allow them to be there,” Vincent said. “There’s not any documentation showing we’ve done testing and you’re safe.” During the pandemic, Vincent learned that Total wanted to drill three more wells behind her playground. Nobody had told her: “It makes me feel like they don’t value our lives.” Last year, as the Black and Latinx neighborhood around her daycare was grappling with high COVID-19 numbers, Vincent learned from a local activist that Total wanted to drill three more wells behind her playground. Neither the company nor the city had informed her, and she took that personally. “I’m African American, and it makes me feel like they don’t value our lives.” Twenty years of fracking in the United States has delivered not only energy independence, but also an expanding export industry in oil, natural gas and liquified natural gas. America’s drilling boom, led by Texas, has also brought heavy industry into many rural and urban communities. Millions of people now live in the shadow of oil and gas wells, unwitting participants in a massive experiment with their health. That drilling poses substantial risks to the climate as well, because methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas. It’s hard to find a place in America where as many people live close to dense drilling as here in Tarrant County. Arlington itself is home to 52 gas well sites and hundreds of wellheads. These wells are often near residential neighborhoods, commercial strips and doctor’s offices. More than 30,000 Arlington children go to public school within half a mile of wells, according to an analysis by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, and up to 7,600 infants and young children attend private daycares within that radius. Eighty-five percent of the public school students are children of color, and more than two-thirds live in poverty. Altogether, more than half of Arlington’s public schools and daycare facilities are within a half-mile of active gas production. Eight daycare centers are within 600 feet, the standard setback in Arlington. In recent years, scores of scientific studies have linked proximity to drilling to increased health risks, including childhood asthma, childhood leukemia and birth defects. The exposures can come from the fumes of diesel trucks, generators or drilling rigs. They can also come from chemicals used in fracking, as companies extract oil and gas from the shale by injecting mixtures of water, sand and chemicals. The exposures can continue over the estimated 25-year lifespan of the wells, as gases leak from wells, tanks, pipes and valves. Researchers at Oregon State University found a 59 percent increase in the odds of at least one asthma hospitalization among children who lived in Texas ZIP codes with fracking. Researchers from the University of Colorado observed that children with congenital heart defects are more likely to be born to mothers living near wells, and children with leukemia are about four times more likely to be living in areas with high levels of oil and gas development. Children and developing fetuses are especially vulnerable to the toxic air pollution, fine particles and other emissions from oil and gas extraction, according to public health experts. Tarrant County has suffered high rates of childhood asthma, birth defects and other potential effects of drilling, but no government agency has ordered the kind of thorough public health assessment that could connect the dots. The state of Colorado commissioned scientific studies, then last year overhauled its oil and gas oversight to prioritize public health. Now, most wells there cannot be closer than 2,000 feet from buildings. And the state is required to “ensure environmental justice for disproportionately impacted communities” by giving them a say in the permitting process. Texas went the opposite direction. After the city of Denton tried to outlaw fracking within its boundaries in 2014, the state Legislature overwhelmingly adopted a law that prohibits local governments from banning drilling or passing any restriction that isn’t “commercially reasonable.” Since then, Texas localities that want to say no to gas companies have faced the prospect of expensive court battles. Still, over the last year, Arlington has started to push back. Last June, when the Arlington City Council convened to discuss Total’s bid to drill and frack three additional wells behind Vincent’s daycare, Mother’s Heart, the nation was deep into a reckoning over racism. In the days leading up to the June 9 meeting, Arlington residents had been taking to the streets in Black Lives Matter protests. Earlier that day, the council had passed two resolutions committing to racial equity. “Can you guarantee me 100 percent that you’re not putting any of us in harm’s way?” Mayor Jeff Williams opened the evening meeting with a moment of silence for George Floyd and a prayer: “Help us to answer the call to help each of our citizens. And especially now, our Black brothers and sisters. Here in our community and throughout our country, Lord, they are hurting as we are hurting,” Williams said, head bowed. “Help to guide us in the direction that we need to go to ensure that each of our citizens is not only treated equally, but treated well.” Vincent was among the first to speak against the permit. “Our clients are about 80 percent African American and about 20 percent Latino,” she said. “Can you guarantee me 100 percent that you’re not putting any of us in harm’s way now or in the future?” Council Member Marvin Sutton pressed Total on whether the company would monitor the air near Mother’s Heart to see whether young children were being exposed to toxic fumes. “No, we don’t do the air monitoring,” said Kevin Strawser, Total’s senior manager for government relations and public affairs. “We rely on the TCEQ for that.” (The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, spokesperson Gary Rasp told Reveal, does not monitor air emissions at individual drilling sites.) Strawser said Total controls air pollution in many ways—by drilling with electric instead of diesel rigs and checking monthly for leaks. “There’s no one better in the business,” he said. “I appreciate the residents around the site and particularly the school that’s just to the north of us. And I feel like we’ve cohabitated there for the last 10 years without any issues.” Ranjana Bhandari, executive director of Liveable Arlington, a volunteer organization that opposes urban drilling, explained how she went door to door before the pandemic, alerting Vincent and others about Total’s plan to drill more wells. “We discovered that nobody was aware of this,” she said. “We did the job that Total should have done.” The profits flow largely to companies and absentee owners, but the risks “mostly stay with and in the local community.” But Council Member Helen Moise, a longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, warned that Arlington’s hands were tied. “As a council, we are aware that fracking is not a desirable activity any longer in a city,” she said. But Arlington was happy to take millions of dollars from gas companies in the past and is now “living with the consequences.” Fracking began here on the Barnett Shale. And communities on the shale did enjoy an influx of cash in the early years of the fracking boom some 15 years ago. In Arlington, oil royalties funded a $100 million Tomorrow Foundation, which awards several million dollars a year to programs that do such things as provide medical care to infants or install energy-saving streetlights. But the economic windfall forecast in industry-funded reports never materialized. Most of the royalties and profits went to companies or absentee owners of mineral rights. “And the potential costs, those mostly stay with and in the local community,” according to Matthew Fry, an associate professor of geography and environment at the University of North Texas, who has researched the impact of drilling in the Barnett Shale. The industry does provide thousands of local jobs, but they now make up less than 1 percent of employment in the county—and today, gas production generates less than 1 percent of county tax revenue, according to industry and government data, a third of its peak. Perhaps the political calculus was beginning to shift. That night, the council did something it had rarely done before. It voted 6 to 3 to reject Total’s plans to drill behind Mother’s Heart. Decades ago, updates to the federal Clean Air Act required companies to install modern pollution control devices whenever they build or modify large facilities such as refineries, incinerators and power plants. It slashed pollution from power plants and other big polluters, as well as cars and trucks, vastly improving air quality in many metropolitan areas. But the law has a blind spot when it comes to oil and gas sites. It considers each well site as a separate source of pollution, even in cases like Arlington, where one company, Total, operates 33, each with multiple wells. “This surgical loophole that no other industry in America has enjoyed prevents sprawling well sites from being considered together,” said John Walke, a former official with the Environmental Protection Agency who is now a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It has incentivized the spreading of wellheads like toxic spores across many communities.” The Obama administration was the first to regulate air pollution released by drilling and fracking; the EPA under his leadership regulated volatile organic compounds in 2012 and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, in 2016. After drilling, companies were required to capture the gas immediately or burn it in a flare rather than release it into the air. Companies were also required to hunt for leaks twice a year and fix them. But the Obama rules regulated only new wells, grandfathering in hundreds of thousands of others, including most of the wells in the Barnett Shale. And those regulations had barely gone into effect when they were gutted by the next president, Donald Trump. NASA detected this methane leak in a California oil field last summer. The oil company in question subsequently confirmed and repaired the leak. These regulatory gaps have left much of the oversight of drilling and fracking in states’ hands. Some states, such as New York, Vermont and Maryland, have banned it. Colorado and Wyoming imposed strict rules. Others, like Texas, have given substantial leeway to industry. “Texas does the minimum of what it has to do to meet federal standards,” said Cyrus Reed, interim director of the Sierra Club’s Texas chapter. “We’ve always argued they should be much more stringent where you have oil and gas mixing with people in close proximity.” In Grand Prairie, a gas company had reported no leaks at its well site in five years. An independent tester found 22 in 15 minutes. Two agencies in Texas regulate oil and gas production: the Texas Railroad Commission, which permits oil and gas drilling and inspects for groundwater contamination every five years, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, which regulates air pollution. It’s responsible for ensuring that the state meets federal air pollution standards for smog, ozone and soot but leaves routine inspection of wells to gas companies like Total. The agency, which conducts inspections only in response to complaints or red flags in gas companies’ self-reports, monitors a tiny fraction of Tarrant County’s 4,001 wells. The TCEQ conducted 93 inspections here in fiscal year 2019 and 134 in fiscal year 2020, according to Gary Rasp, the TCEQ spokesperson. The TCEQ can set individualized emission limits as part of the permitting process. But the agency offers leniency to many companies, allowing most well sites in Tarrant County, including some of Total’s, to obtain a permit by rule. That status allows companies to avoid not only individualized emission limits, but also public hearings. Some communities on the Barnett Shale have stepped in to fill the regulatory gaps. Kenneth Tramm’s company, Modern Geosciences, has been contracted by five municipalities to inspect well sites for leaks. In one case in Grand Prairie, a gas company reported no leaks at its well site over the course of five years. Yet in a 2015 audit, Tramm’s company found 22 leaks in 15 minutes. “A lot of people are using instruments that honestly couldn’t see numbers that would matter,” Tramm said. “Yet they derive a comfort from the performance of an inspection.” The inadequate inspections come at a cost. He recalls visiting a site in Denton in 2018 where he said his instruments detected “a catastrophic failure.” “Something on one of their tanks is actually blowing out,” he said. “So it’s immediate lockdown.” As gas production declines, researchers have found that methane pollution rates are actually increasing. In Arlington, lax regulations mean no government entity has ever conducted an environmental impact or health assessment of either individual wells or the cumulative effects of the oil and gas enterprise that sprawls across the city. Nor, as Ranjana Bhandari, the anti-drilling activist, points out, has there ever been an effort to evaluate whether the drilling disproportionately affects communities of color. “I’m quite certain that there is no requirement” to assess wells’ environmental impact, Richard Gertson, the city’s assistant director of planning, told Reveal. “We’re not ignorant of the fact that any operation, much less gas drilling, is going to have impacts. We just have to balance it appropriately against our obligation not only to the citizens, but also to operators for commercially reasonable extraction.” Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin recently studied emissions from the Barnett Shale and found that the amount of methane pollution being released per unit of gas is growing even as production declines. Some emissions come from large equipment failures, according to David Allen, a co-author of the study and a former chair of the EPA’s science advisory board, but much comes from thousands of smaller leaks across the nation’s fourth-largest metro area. Equipment parts, he said, are “going to continue to break and then get repaired and break and get repaired.” Bhandari, an economist and former college instructor, had her first brush with gas drilling in 2007. That’s when Chesapeake Energy Corp. sent landmen door to door in her affluent neighborhood in West Arlington, a hilly area of elegant homes on large, elaborately landscaped lots. Chesapeake, later acquired by Total, wanted the mineral rights to the gas below their homes. Bhandari, who didn’t want drilling anywhere near her son, then 5, refused to sign. Some neighbors had a different strategy, she said—they wanted the royalties without the drill rigs. Ultimately, the company agreed to move the well site about a mile away and drill horizontally from there. The experience taught Bhandari that property owners can influence where drilling happens—in a way that renters can’t. “When I drive out of my neighborhood, within about three minutes, I see three drill sites, and they are right next door to much poorer homes,” she said. In the years that followed, the Sierra Club, the environmental advocacy group, promoted natural gas as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. So did then-President Barack Obama. Their argument at the time was that power plants using natural gas pump out far less carbon dioxide than coal-fired plants. But they didn’t factor in the vast amounts of methane—an even more potent greenhouse gas—that leak from wells and other equipment. In the midst of the ensuing fracking boom, new drill sites kept getting approved in Arlington. Bhandari expected national environmental groups to swoop in and raise a ruckus. But “nobody came, nobody did anything,” Bhandari recalls. “We were on our own.” New drill sites kept getting approved, but “nobody came, nobody did anything…We were on our own.”  The few neighborhoods that managed to keep out drilling, Bhandari noticed, were affluent like hers.  One of those rare places was an upscale, predominantly white neighborhood called Rush Creek. During a packed 2012 City Council meeting, scores of people spoke against drilling there, including then-Mayor Robert Cluck. He urged the gas company to drill horizontally from somewhere else to access the gas. “I think there are other ways to get to this area rather than putting it in a place that’s surrounded by homes and is a beautiful place,” Cluck said. “This is a premium housing area. Why in the world would you not come from some other place?”     After the council voted to spare Rush Creek, it approved drilling in a predominantly Latinx area near Cowboys Stadium, where the median household income is $23,000, less than half the city median. “That night was pretty revealing,” recalled Bhandari, who watched the meeting remotely. “I was pretty horrified.” From Bhandari’s perspective, there was now so much drilling in Arlington that it had changed the character of her city. She said she’d get headaches from the fumes as she drove around town. In 2013, the City Council was considering a request to drill near two daycares. For the first time, she got up to speak. Despite voices of opposition, the council voted to approve a new drill zone at a well pad called Rocking Horse. Although Bhandari didn’t realize it at the time, that decision—to permit not a single drill site, but an entire zone—would frustrate drilling opponents years into the future. “I didn’t want to be an activist…When you live in places like this, you have to do this for your children.” The following year, Bhandari and a half-dozen other mothers and grandmothers banded together to launch Liveable Arlington. “Something just snapped, and I said we were going to form a group,” she recalled. “I didn’t want to be an activist. I still don’t think of myself as one. When you live in places like this, you have to do this for your children.” Later that year, the people of nearby Denton passed their fateful ballot initiative to ban fracking, spurring the state Legislature to rise to the defense of the gas industry. House Bill 40—one of a wave of state preemption laws sweeping the country—passed the Texas House overwhelmingly, 125-20. Rep. Chris Turner, a Democrat who represents Arlington, was one of the few to oppose it. In March, he introduced legislation to give local communities more say. But with Republicans in control of the Legislature, his bill hasn’t gotten a floor vote. That’s left opposition in the hands of volunteers like Bhandari. Liveable Arlington’s first big win was in 2017, when a gas company applied to drill a wastewater injection well near Lake Arlington, the source of drinking water for half a million people. Bhandari’s group organized a petition opposing the permit, and the company withdrew its application. Before Mother’s Heart, the only time the Arlington City Council had rejected Total’s drilling plans was in 2018, when the company sought a permit near another daycare, Cornerstone Academy. But after Total promised to relocate Cornerstone’s playground, the council reversed itself and approved the wells. Given that experience, Bhandari said she was on edge last summer, “waiting to find out what mischief they’re planning. I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Total win something here easily.” At first blush, the Mother’s Heart vote seemed like a turning point. But in the ensuing months, Total continued to press for the right to drill next to preschools. And previous City Council votes, combined with that 2015 state law, would make it hard for the city to say no. Total did not immediately challenge the Mother’s Heart vote. It simply pivoted to securing a permit to drill seven new wells at Rocking Horse, the well pad that inspired Bhandari’s first anti-fracking speech. Rocking Horse is in Council Member Marvin Sutton’s district, where the majority of residents are African American or Latinx. It’s also right next to two daycares licensed to care for about 250 kids. Directly to the east of the well pad lies block after block of modest, single-family homes built in the 1980s. The daycares are just to the northeast. But Total didn’t have to face those parents or residents in a public hearing. Nor did Sutton and his council colleagues get to vote. In that 2013 vote—the one where Bhandari first spoke out and long before Sutton was elected—the City Council had granted Total a “drill zone” at Rocking Horse, giving the company the indefinite right to secure new drilling permits without a vote or public meeting. Gas companies had pressed for the city to create these zones. “There is no need to burden council with additional permit approvals,” one gas company, Vantage, argued at the time. “You see it happening recklessly close to homes, schools and medical offices. You see no neighborhood input. You see really, really weak rules.” “It’s completely emblematic of all the things that are wrong with urban drilling in Arlington,” Bhandari said. “You see it happening recklessly close to homes, schools and medical offices. You see no neighborhood input. You see really, really weak rules and no will or desire on the part of local government or the state to see that those rules are actually implemented.” Reveal asked Richard Gertson, the Arlington planning official, about his office’s decision to approve the permits at Rocking Horse right after the council blocked drilling near Mother’s Heart. “I understand those who may say, ‘Well, they’re exactly the same aren’t they?’ It’s drilling and you’ve got daycares and all these other uses, but it’s a different situation as far as we’re concerned,” he said. “Once the council establishes that drill zone, as they did in 2013, then any future permit applications, if they are inside that drill zone, they may be approved administratively.” In November, 10 days after Total had begun drilling under its new permits at Rocking Horse, Liveable Arlington captured video of black smoke billowing from the machinery. Bhandari suspected the company may have been using a diesel rig. Bhandari sent the video to a city inspector, who confirmed her suspicions. The city let Total finish the well that was underway but required the company to halt additional work until it brought in an electric rig, Gertson said. “That’s not our procedure to try to babysit a site or to monitor a site during drilling.” “Those little children have no voice in this,” Bhandari said. “They are completely at the mercy of this nexus of politicians and an industry that just operates like it’s above the law.” She said Total’s use of the diesel rig exemplifies the company’s complete disregard for the rules—until it gets caught. In Texas, there is rarely anyone looking. Last year, when Total asked the state environmental agency for a permit by rule to drill and frack those seven new wells at Rocking Horse, the agency laid out its lack of oversight in a letter: “Be advised no review has been done by TCEQ to verify that the site meets the requirements of the permit by rule.” Gertson, too, was explicit that his office expects gas operators to police themselves. “That’s not our procedure to try to babysit a site or to monitor a site during drilling,” he said. Total declined to respond to questions, but Kevin Strawser, the senior manager, issued a brief statement. “We operate our sites in a safe and environmentally responsible way that is compliant with the requirements of our business,” he said, adding that the company works “diligently to ensure the safety and quality of life for our neighbors near our sites.” Marvin Sutton spent his career as an air traffic controller at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, where keeping people safe was his mission. After the diesel rig incident, he headed over to the Rocking Horse well site to assess the risks. The Childcare Network is just 359 feet away from the drilling, and its outdoor play area is even closer.           “We know that distance between airplanes increases our margin of safety,” Sutton said. “The goal is to add a margin of safety and protect the kids.” His decision to run for City Council was driven by a desire to improve public safety in his hometown. He ran six times before winning a seat in 2019. Air pollution worries him, but so does the risk of accidents, like when a gas pipeline released 60,000 pounds of volatile organic compounds near Arlington during February’s cold snap or a 2015 well blowout sent 42,800 gallons of fracking fluid onto Arlington streets. Exasperated that a City Council decision eight years ago prevented him from protecting the daycares near Rocking Horse today, Sutton proposed to change the rules. He sought to measure the 600-foot setback between wells and daycares not from the facility, but from the property line. That was enough to run afoul of Total. In February email exchanges obtained by Reveal, Total told city staff that it wanted the city to exclude its existing well sites from the proposed restrictions, mentioning one well pad in particular, called Galletta. Failing to do so, wrote Julie Jones, Total’s manager for regulation and real estate, “could prohibit further development of wells at that location.” Total went on to claim that failing to issue the exemption would violate state law—and cited HB 40 by name. Galletta is 280 feet from a shopping center that’s home to Little Texans of Arlington Daycare. At one meeting, city staff presented satellite images showing two Total well sites operating outside drill zones and adjacent to daycare centers. At a City Council meeting in February, city staff presented satellite images showing two Total well sites, including Galletta, operating outside of drill zones and adjacent to daycares. The well sites are so close to daycares, they said, that changing the setback from buildings to property lines could indeed prevent Total from drilling new wells there. The staff report indicated meetings with the gas industry, but not with the daycares. And it noted that the gas industry saw the measure as a slippery slope; next, the city would want to increase setbacks for other protected uses, such as schools or doctor’s offices. Council Member Andrew Piel, an industry supporter, cited Total’s email saying, “I didn’t want to expose the city to litigation.” The email exchanges show an extensive back and forth between Arlington’s staff and Total’s. “I know staff is and will continue to look for possible solutions to avoid a potential legal conflict,” wrote Galen Gatten, the city’s land use attorney. The council compromised, deciding that the 600-foot setback will now also apply to playgrounds, but not property lines. The ordinance change, adopted unanimously in April, also grandfathered in existing drill zones, which would allow more drilling at Rocking Horse. Sutton saw the ordinance change as “testing the waters,” a step toward reasserting local control. So was his recent mayoral bid, in which he came in third in a crowded field, running on a platform that emphasized drilling safety. “We’ve opened the door,” he said, “and we’re going to continue to open that door, to get what we really need to protect our citizens and to protect our kids.” Even as the nation grapples with climate change and recognizes the need to wean itself off fossil fuels, the residents of Arlington—and millions of others who live close to wells—can expect to keep living with drilling for decades. Their fate now turns on the demands of a growing new export industry that’s ramping up to ship methane across the globe in the form of liquified natural gas. We’ve opened the door…to get what we really need to protect our citizens and to protect our kids.” President Joe Biden has declared his commitment to slashing greenhouse gas pollution by at least 50 percent by the end of the decade. But he has also said he will not ban fracking—and he has yet to lay out how he will square those two commitments. As for liquefied natural gas, Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, told Congress in January that these exports “have an important role to play in reducing international consumption of fuels that have greater contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.” Total is based in France, which banned fracking in 2017. Yet thanks in part to drilling in U.S. shale communities like Arlington, the company is a player in liquefied natural gas on a global scale. Total has just rebranded as TotalEnergies, building on its pledge to be a net-zero greenhouse gas polluter by 2050. But its plan to be “a world-class player in the energy transition” still depends heavily on drilling and fracking. “Total has made natural gas, the least polluting of all fossil fuels, a cornerstone of its strategy in order to meet the growing global demand for energy while helping to mitigate climate change,” the company said in an April report. The EPA, stuck figuring out how to manage fracking’s environmental fallout, begins listening sessions today as it prepares to draft new rules to control the inevitable methane leaks. Many people who are trying to carve out lives inside the drill zone—from Texas to California, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania and beyond—have signed up to speak, as has Bhandari. She wants answers about why the U.S. government lets Total drill in the backyard of American daycares when it cannot frack anywhere in its home country. “We have this ingrained sense that this couldn’t happen in America, so we are willfully looking at it and choosing not to recognize it for what it is,” Bhandari said. “This is ecocide.” This story was produced by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting.

Cryptomining is an attempt by a third party to harness the computing power of another organisation in mining for a cryptocurrency. It is not directed at personal data. The university’s chief information officer Richard Williams said staff and students were asked to change their passwords as a precaution.

Massey staff were busy this week working to help students change passwords. “The university has engaged an external specialist incident response team to assist in managing this attempt.” A statement, which the university would only attribute to an unnamed spokesperson, said Massey followed globally recognised best practice to protect its IT systems. “Like all large organisations, the university’s technology infrastructure is regularly targeted,” the statement said. “We have not had an external compromise in over five years.” Massey has thousands of students and staff, but the university has a range of security defences to protect its people and information from unauthorised access, modification or destruction.  “We have implemented a range of controls to ensure security against threatening cyber behaviour. This includes password security, multi-factor authentication and risk assessments for new services.  “We have an information-security policy which is supported by a number of other more specific policies, like our password policy.  “These arrangements are reinforced by security training and awareness.” The cryptomining attempt follows a cyberattack on the Waikato District Health Board last month, which left the health board without access to IT systems and some patient details were sent to media.",2021-06-15

Coinbase To Trade Shiba Inu Coinbase announced Tuesday that shiba inu (SHIB) crypto would begin trading on Coinbase Pro this week, after the listing of the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) earlier this month. Some consider the ERC20 crypto shiba inu to be a viable alternative to Dogecoin. Coinbase Pro users can now transfer shiba inu tokens into their accounts, according to the Nasdaq-listed business. Residents of New York, however, will not be able to use SHIB.

Coinbase added SHIB little more than a month after that coin’s creation, in marked contrast to its addition of dogecoin, which seemed to take doge years. This reflects a sea change in the approach of the exchange, a change announced at the time of its addition of dogecoin on June 1. The announcement also covers chiliz (CHZ) and the keep network (KEEP). Besides dogecoin, the company recently added trading support for a number of tokens on Coinbase Pro, including polkadot (DOT), gitcoin (GTC), enzyme token (MLN), amp (AMP), and internet computer (ICP). Shiba Inu is a meme coin similar to Dogecoin, which was inspired by a Shiba Inu meme from the 2010s. It is, however, an ERC20 token, which means it functions on the Ethereum network, unlike DOGE.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  SHIB is the 17th-largest coin by market capitalization, according to Nomics, with over $9 billion—more than Stellar, Ethereum Classic, or Dai. Shiba Inu’s anonymous founder Ryoshi (a psuedonym) made the unwise decision to send half of the token’s supply to the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin. Why? Ryoshi’s claims that he wanted to minimize Shiba Inu’s supply and increase its value. Two days after Shiba Inu got listed on Binance, Buterin donated $1 billion worth of Shiba Inu to an India-based COVID-19 fund. Unfortunately, the token suffered as a result and tanked to painful lows.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Related article | Vitalik Buterin Dumps His SHIB, Price Tanks 30% In 1 Hour Now that Coinbase added Shiba Inu to its list of supported cryptocurrencies, “Dogecoin killer” token holders now have renewed hope that Shiba Inu can surpass its Elon Musk-led rival to the moon. Price Soars After Announcement The price of the shiba inu cryptocurrency jumped over 30% around the time of the Coinbase announcement. At the time of writing, the price of SHIB is $0.0000092 and its market cap is $3.6 billion, based on data from Coinbase. ShIB/USD currently at $0.0000092 following Coinbase news. Source: TradingView. Trading of SHIB-USD and SHIB-USDT order books will begin in three phases, post-only, limit-only, and full trading, once adequate supply of the shiba inu cryptocurrency is established on the Coinbase Pro platform, according to the firm.
