Hindsight always allows people to make the best picks, but it’s a little different when you’re looking to the future. People are apprehensive about the future, and they tend to think that certain types of technology, even new trends, are going to fizzle as fads. Are crypto-currencies here to stay? No one can tell the future. Yet these digital currencies look like a great example of a new type of technology that is here to stay, at least for quite some time. Even buy and hold investors know that they aren’t holding onto stocks for a lifetime. Buffet even buys and sells. Therefore, the fact that these crypto-currencies represent a viable buy and hold opportunity for a time suggests that perhaps it’s time for investors to pay attention. There are certainly all types of investments to choose from, many of them generating nice returns these days. So why digital currencies? Some of the returns that crypto-currencies have been producing in recent years have been astronomical. You had to have been avoiding the news not to see what happened to BTC or Bitcoin in 2017 and early 2018.  IMAGE: PEXELS You could say the same thing about ETH or Ethereum, and a lesser-known digital currency, too, XRP or Ripple. Ripple didn’t balloon to a price that is similar to the value of a Bitcoin, but it went from selling at mere pennies to a few dollars a coin. If you do that math, that’s a huge return. Naturally, in recent months, the returns for many digital currencies have been going in the other direction. They did balloon quite a lot, and they did it quickly. Not all of them followed suit either. In fact, some crypto-currencies are duds, and that’s why you have to choose your investments wisely. Yet you’re not looking for the digital currencies you invest in to balloon to an enormous price all at once. You’re looking at the long-term opportunity, like an Amazon play. If you make a move like that, then you could end up with millions of dollars and telling others about how you got involved in crypto-currencies when they were in their infancy. That statement makes a good point. The reason why most people didn’t invest in a company like Amazon when it was in its infancy is that it wasn’t the company then that it is today. It’s easy to say investing in Amazon is a good idea today, and the share price is astronomical. The same could possibly be said about digital currencies, though we aren’t there yet. There were certainly many millionaires made when the last digital currency boom happened quickly. Yet what about the long-term? These digital currencies may not look good to every investor, just like Amazon didn’t initially look good to every investor. Yet what about later on down the road? To Regulate Or Not To Regulate One of the same principles that draw many people to digital currencies also makes them leery. How is that? The fact that crypto-currencies aren’t regulated by the government or banks is what draws many people to want to invest in them. Yet people also have the tendency to think that one day they will be regulated, and so they are hesitant, all things considered.Related Posts:10 Tips To Sell Private Label Products Like Hot Cake On…The Complete Guide For Selling Advertising On Your Blog Or…How Should A Newcomer Invest In Cryptocurrency With CEX.IO7 Reasons Why You Can Not Run A Business Without An App5 Tips You Can Follow To Save For Your Dream Car The experts say, however, that the regulation of crypto-currencies wouldn’t necessarily mean their demise. It may sound like a grand idea to have currencies that aren’t regulated, but is it really? Would currencies that are popular and subsequently regulated be better than the system that is in place now? It’s impossible to tell what is going to happen with the digital currency market. Yet you can take a good hard look and see what you think in regards to what investments you want to make. Picking a home run hitter before he becomes a home run hitter isn’t easy. That’s just a baseball analogy to help you figure out why people have such a hard time picking out the next Amazon and why they are hesitant about digital currencies. Crypto-currencies aren’t hitting home run after home run just yet, but they are in fact showing signs that they might. Three of the digital currencies have really shown those signs, and it’s hard to argue with how popular Bitcoin has become. What else is important to note? Life Application With the introduction of so many digital currencies, it makes some people wonder why there are all those choices. After all, each country only has one actual currency. Yet you have to understand the blockchain and the fact that each of these crypto-currencies is supposed to have its own real-world application. For example, Ripple is tied to the banking system. There are talks of major companies out there starting to accept digital currencies soon enough. That can make you really start to take note of the opportunity that might be in front of you right now. That doesn’t mean, however, that you get giddy about buying all those digital currencies. You have to understand your investments, and even the most savvy investors can’t always pick home run hitters before they hit home runs. If you were to try and pick the next Amazon back when, would you have picked the company or a different one? Maybe you were an investor then and tried but didn’t see it coming. It’s one thing to recognize the fact that digital currencies have the opportunity to really blow up in the future. Yet they aren’t all in the same boat. You have to think about which ones are going to do well. It’s not going to be easy to pick the winners. Just because Bitcoin has done it before doesn’t mean it will be the one to do it again. Which of the digital currencies out there right now are set to explode in the coming years as the market moves in that direction?

This is despite the flurry of positive price boosting Cardano news which should naturally lift prices above it’s all-time-lows and main support at 7 cents. If anything, Cardano has a bearish outlook that’s unless there is a high-volume break and close above 7 cents later today. Latest Cardano News It’s true that there is a positive correlation between altcoins including Cardano and Bitcoin. Dominating at more than 55 percent at the time of press, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson told Mpho Dagada that was it not for Bitcoin, we would not have Cardano, a platform that wants to change the way smart contracting is executed. Thanks to the Cypriot Crisis in late 2012-2013, the event propelled the Bitcoin prices from almost zero to $250 giving it a pass to the media which in turn funneled as these investors keen on exploring the “amazing” technology and digital money.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  The banking crisis in Cyprus did create problems but it was instead a platform for Charles Hoskinson to be a force in the crypto space which made him possible to create IOHK, Dan Larimer of EOS and Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum. Since then, Cardano as an idea has been evolving. Currently, the team is even talking of developing solutions that continue to be problematic in the Bitcoin ecosystem. That of UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Output. Besides, the platform under the Byron Stage is planning on Marlowe, a templating language platform with smart contracting capabilities.

What this means is that last week’s solid candlestick is still a shadow for recent bullish events and could hamper recovery. In any case anyway, last week remains an important candlestick in our analysis. It was a bearish engulfing bar breaking below 9 cents and retesting ADA’s ATLs at 7 cents. The level as we have seen in previous Cardano price analysis is an important support level for Cardano price and was broken early this week.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  As such, though there is a minor shift in sentiment, Cardano buyers are yet to shake off sell pressure. Going forward, Cardano prices might collapse and print new lows in coming days. Daily Cardano Price Chart Daily Cardano Price Chart by Trading View Considering the development of Sep 12, Cardano prices did recover on Sep 13. On Sep 12, a bear pin bar printed with abnormally high trading volumes The result was a three-bar bullish reversal pattern, the Morning Star. However, ADA is yet to close above 7 cents signaling shift of trend. Instead, yesterday’s lower time frame consolidation means our Cardano sells hold true. Unless otherwise Cardano prices recover and hit stops at 8 cents, our previous Cardano price prediction will be valid.

A sell-off through the late morning led Bitcoin Cash to an early afternoon intraday low $439.2, steering clear of the day’s first major support level at $438.03 before a partial recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was up 0.55% to $449.5, with Bitcoin moving from a start of a day low $445.9 to a morning high $457.4 before easing back, the day’s major support and resistance levels left untested. For the day ahead, moving back through the morning high would support a run at $460 levels to bring the day’s first major resistance level at $468.33 into play, though Bitcoin Cash will need to move through and hold above $453 in the early part of the day to support the beginnings of a weekend rally. Failure to move back through to $450 levels could see Bitcoin Cash hit reverse later in the day, with a pullback through the morning low $445.9 brining sub-$440 levels and the day’s first major support level at $431.33 into play, though we would expect Bitcoin Cash to steer clear of the day’s major support levels barring materially negative news hitting the wires. {alt}Litecoin Bucks the TrendLitecoin gained 2.99% on Friday, following Thursday’s 5.83% rally, to end the day at $56.23, two consecutive days of gains leading Litecoin into positive territory for the week, Litecoin up 2.42% Monday through Friday. A relatively choppy start to the day saw Litecoin pullback from a morning high $55.01 to an early afternoon intraday low $52.92 before finding support, the day’s low steering clear of the first major support level at $52.27. Litecoin rebounded through afternoon, breaking through the day’s first major resistance level at $56.27 and second major resistance level at $57.94 to an intraday high $58.9, before easing back to $56 levels, Litecoin bucking the trend across the broader market on the day.Story continues At the time of writing, Litecoin was up 0.37% to $56.54, with Litecoin tracking the broader market in the early hours, rising to a morning high $57.82 before easing back, the morning’s low $56.05 coming at the start of the day. For the day ahead, holding on to $56 levels through the morning would support another run at $58 levels, to bring the day’s first major resistance level at $59.11 into play, though we would expect Litecoin to struggle to break through to $59 levels on the day. Failure to hold on to $56 levels through the morning could see Litecoin pullback through the morning low $56.05 to bring sub-$55 levels into play, while Litecoin will likely steer clear of the day’s first major support level at $53.13, barring particularly negative news hitting the wires.  {alt}Ripple on the DefensiveRipple’s XRP slipped by 1.18% on Friday, partially reversing Thursday’s 3.5% gain, to end the day at $0.27618, the Friday pullback leaving Ripple’s XRP down 0.34% for the week, Monday through Friday.A bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP move through to an early morning intraday high $0.28523, the day’s high coming within reach of the day’s first major resistance level at $0.2877 before pulling back, a late morning reversal seeing Ripple’s XRP fall to an early afternoon intraday low $0.271. Recovering to an afternoon high $0.28213, Ripple’s XRP was unable to hold on to gains by the day’s end, with Ripple’s XRP now having failed to close out at $0.28 levels since 7th September. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up 0.53% to $0.27745. Moves through the early morning left the day’s major support and resistance levels untested, with Ripple’s XRP hitting a morning high $0.28 before easing back to hold just above a start of a day morning low $0.27599. For the day ahead, holding above $0.275 through the morning would support another run at $0.28 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $0.2839 into play, with any broad based market rally likely to support a run at $0.29 levels, though we would expect Ripple’s XRP to struggle to hold on to $0.29 levels in the event of a move. Failure to hold above $0.275 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse later in the day, with the day’s first major support level at $0.2697 certainly in play, though we would expect plenty of support at sub-$0.27 levels for Ripple’s XRP to avoid the day’s major support levels, unless the broader market gets hit with dire news from regulators. {alt} Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency InstantlyThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE: Natural Gas Price Forecast – natural gas markets fall hard on Friday  Gold Weekly Price Forecast – Gold undecided for the week  Natural Gas Weekly Price Forecast – natural gas has an ugly week  EUR/USD Weekly Price Forecast – Euro rallies for the week  Crude Oil Price Forecast – crude oil volatile for Friday session  EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro rolls over on Friday session ","2018-09-15"

But why?Amazon was careful to bring the most 'pleasing' sounding voice into people's living roomsBig tech giants are careful in considering how they market and design their products — and it's no coincidence Jeff Bezos chose the voice and name of a woman for Amazon's language assistant.

""In antiquity, it was a library that could answer any question and hosted all the collective knowledge of the world at that time."" Advertisement   Advertisement  Various studies suggest female voices are perceived as more ""cordial""While Rausch didn't elaborate further on the trials used to ascertain that female voices were preferred, he did state that the trials showed we generally opt for women to assist us and that we find their voices more agreeable — a finding that echoes numerous other studies that were carried out well before language assistants came along.In  an experiment  by the University of Indiana, researchers found that both men and women have a preference for female voices over male or computer voices, and that they find the former more cordial.                                        Amazon's profits depend on whether we see Alexa as ""nice"" — an enjoyable user experience makes it more probable that users will feel inclined to make purchases.                                                                                        Amazon                                                        This preference apparently stems from the fact that the voice automatically triggers certain stereotypical expectations in our minds, according to  a study  by Stanford University.While the study highlights that we identify with and relate better to machines if they're assigned any gender, it also underlines that we impose stereotypes onto machines depending on the gender of the voice — in other words, we perceive computers as ""helpful"" and ""caring"" when they're programmed with the voice a woman. Advertisement   Advertisement  It turns out a nice voice can really be good for businessTech companies clearly seemed to have picked up on this strategy and it's working well for them: according to a survey by market researcher Norstat, around 90% of users are satisfied with Alexa's, Cortana's, Siri's, and the Google Assistant's respective voices — and those 90% are particularly important to Amazon.The reason for this is simply that, whether or not we perceive Alexa as ""pleasant"" has a direct impact on Amazon's profits — the company doesn't actually earn that much on the sale of the Echo devices; it makes more from people using the devices through shopping and data.By making Alexa a female, she seems more like a friendly older sister or girlfriend we — apparently — prefer interacting with, shopping with, and asking for help, rather than a computer, making it more likely we'll make purchases.

Improvements to the bitcoin infrastructure seem to be happening at a pace never before seen in the space. However, the price has not responded to the fundamentals… Yet. Last Time the Bulls Ran, This Time We’re Looking at a Stampede There is no doubt about it, 2018 has been something of a reality check for many bitcoin enthusiasts. The exuberance of last year’s epic bull market seems to have largely given way to pessimism, and market sentiment surrounding the space is less optimistic than it ever has been in the memory of many participants. However, as one Twitter user points out, bitcoin achieved its $20,000 all-time high without many of the developments that have occurred, been announced, or are expected to come in the next twelve months or so:                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                   #bitcoin hit $20K last year.. – without Goldman Sachs– without Morgan Stanley– without Citigroup– without ETFs– without the #lightningnetwork Relax… the next rally will be bigger than you can ever anticipate. ??? — Conan O'Bitcoin (@ConanOBitcoin) September 14, 2018  There is certainly a lot to be optimistic about in bitcoin right now. The number one cryptocurrency has grabbed the attention of some of the traditional financial industry’s largest institutions and where once was scepticism, intrigue can now be found. In the remainder of 2018 and going forward into 2019, there are many events upcoming that could well spark a bull run that will likely dwarf those all before it.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Firstly, there is the Bakkt platform with backing from the ICE, along with Microsoft and Starbucks. The new product is expected to make getting exposure to BTC easier than ever before for both retail and institutional investors. It is set to launch this November. Likewise, Goldman Sachs are still exploring how to bring both a trading desk and a custody solution to market. These two developments from such an established name will surely inspire confidence amongst other financial institutions that bitcoin is not going to disappear any time soon. In addition, there seems to be considerable interest coming from the clients of financial heavyweights Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Both are in the process of launching futures and derivative products surrounding BTC. These developments are thought by many to be capable of bringing stability to the highly volatile asset class. This will in turn make investing in bitcoin more appealing to those with the financial clout to drive prices sky high.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Even the various Crypto ETF’s proposed to the SEC have been given renewed hope through the appointment of Elad Roisman to the position of commissioner. Roisman is known to be supportive of cryptocurrencies and his nomination by President Trump and subsequent inclusion in the regulatory body can only be positive for the digital asset space going forward. Away from mainstream financial interest in bitcoin, there are also exciting developments underway from a technical standpoint. The Lightning Network continues to make advances and more channels open by the day. The upgrade should allow bitcoin to handle a far greater number of transactions when the next bull run does kick off. During the 2017 market surge, a lot of doubt was cast over the usability of the bitcoin protocol because fees rocketed at the same time as the price did. This was certainly responsible for many exploring alt-coin markets since they thought bitcoin would remain too expensive for practical use. There’s a lot going on and any one of these events could provide the catalyst to send prices upwards in a meaningful way. Together, it seems more of a case of when rather than if bitcoin will surpass its current all-time high. Once the ball is in motion, the hype train gets running and, as always, more people get exposed to and learn about the disruptive potential of bitcoin. The future is certainly bright for bitcoin.

Their annualized 3.4% rise was the sharpest since September 2012 and well ahead of forecasts. This pleasant surprise for battered, rare-breed Aussie bulls, was followed shortly by yet another. August’s employment data showed job creation still running hot, with  full-time roles expanding nicely.AUD/USD even chalked up the rare feat of five straight sessions of gains. However, the difficulties which have seen the Aussie under pressure all year endure. Yes, the domestic economy performing quite well. But inflation remains low, consumer debt is still very high and the interest-rate differential in favor of the US Dollar yawns, and will yawn still wider as the Federal Reserve continues to hike.Moreover trade tensions between the US and China cannot fail to hit Australia, a country whose economic, security and political fortunes are perhaps uniquely tied to those of the two global giants. Even were that not so dramatically the case, trade tensions tend to it growth-linked currencies such as the Australian Dollar disproportionately hard. For all the current economic cheer, no change is priced into Australian interest rate futures for all of next year. Recall that the Official Cash Rate remains stuck at the 1.50% record low which has already endured unchanged since August, 2016. So, the Australian Dollar still has trouble enough, and that is likely to remain the case for as long as there is simply no evidence that domestic inflation is rising, or that trade is calming as a global worry.Still, while AUD/USD remains a strategic short, it may not fall too much further in the coming week.

Politics and election matters are now the major news items across the country. It is believed that by the end of this month, almost all aspects of our national existence would come to a halt until the elections are over. Interestingly, our world has become so dependent on technology that you can’t discuss elections and not mention the role of technology; whether for good or bad. The fact that we now have over 90 registered political parties is an over-stretch. How do you conduct transparent elections with over 90 political parties without technology? Election technology if properly implemented and adhered to enhances voter identification, rules out identification fraud which encourages multiple voting and makes the voting process much easier and faster.  Although technology can guarantee electoral integrity, it is dependent on the limits of the technology deployed because technology can fail and it is prone to being compromised. As a proud Nigerian citizen with my Permanent Voter Card, I wish to share a few thoughts on ways to ensure that we strengthen our electoral process and make it more acceptable. Confronting the menace of fake news       Fake news is a menace that even social media platform owners don’t know how to deal with. The Director of BBC World Service, Mr. Jamie Angus, who featured on the Sunrise Daily, Channels TV a few weeks ago, said, “…as 2019 election approaches, politicians would use opportunity to plant and spread malicious stories.” His fears have also been expressed by a number of people both within and outside the government. One thing is clear: we must confront the issue of fake news. While researching for this piece, I put a call through to the Director, Voter Education, Publicity, Gender and CSO Liaison, INEC, Oluwole Uzzi, and he said that some of the ways the commission was dealing with the challenge of fake news was through massive sensitisation, public awareness, timely release of information and access to genuine source of information. Fake news can only be curbed with the cooperation of everyone who is using one of those devices or belongs to those platforms as purveyors of fake news. As a personal example, I do not share or forward any information that I received except I am 100 per cent sure of the source. This is a personal policy that I have employed to ensure I am not part of the fake news promoters in any way possible. Proper use of PVC/Smart card reader INEC currently uses the Permanent Voter Card to facilitate voting activities in the country. Smart card readers are used to determine the authenticity of the PVC and access voter information before eligible voters are allowed to cast their votes. This election technology is good and simple for voters. Its beauty is that it perfectly complements the use of ballot papers.         However, I remember that during the last general elections, a number of Nigerians were not properly educated on how best to use these devices. It is important for INEC to engage in massive enlightenment campaign that will ensure that more people are aware of how to properly use these smart card readers. Voting with ATM cards/BVN I often wonder why we can’t vote with our ATM cards or bank verification numbers. I believe this process may work in Nigeria, particularly because of BVN policy and will likely enhance voting security and user identification. The only challenge however is that millions of Nigerians have not been captured into the financial sector and will be potentially disenfranchised.  Related News   Appeal court adjourns case seeking Buhari's removal, Atiku's declaration as president  2019 election showed Nigerians not ready for real change –Moghalu  INEC releases report on 2019 election    Experimentation with blockchain technology Considering that blockchain technology is sweeping across the world in a swift pool, several countries have begun to experiment with blockchain voting. This involves the use of voting via crypto currencies such as Bitcoin to record and audit votes. Blockchain voting enables voters to cast their votes from their smartphones from far-away distances. It eliminates voter frauds since the identity of the voter is verified using biometric tools such as a thumbprint scan when using a mobile device to vote. West Virginia is the first United States state to experiment with blockchain voting and it turned out a huge success although a small number of voters were used to try the new voting technology.       Blockchain voting was also tried in the Zug municipality of Switzerland and was recorded as successful. It is said that the US election officials are currently arranging for many Americans overseas to vote using blockchain technology in the coming November elections. Online/Internet voting Nigerians, particularly those in the Diaspora, have been clamouring for online election which is widely accepted as feasible because of its seeming simplicity. In the United States, 32 states offered online voting systems to ease the voting process for the electorates though experts warned that online voting was not secure. According to election security experts, Internet voting is fraught with risks of election/voting manipulations which may not be detectable before officials are sworn into office. “We believe that online voting, especially online voting in large scale, introduces great risk into the election system by threatening voters’ expectations of confidentiality, accountability and security of their votes and provides an avenue for malicious actors to manipulate the voting results,” Neil Jenkins, an official in the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security, United States. My concluding thought is that the 2019 general elections are going to be a herculean task for the Nigerian state, the electoral umpire, the political parties and the electorate themselves. For us to make the most of the process, we need to leverage various technologies in the entire process from planning, to implementation, sensitisation, collation of results and announcement. “The purpose of an election is not just to select a winner but to convince the loser and their supporters that they lost. Trust in the voting process is, therefore, an essential element to any voting system,” Dr. Vanessa Teague, a cryptographer and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia told CSO Online.    Copyright PUNCH.
