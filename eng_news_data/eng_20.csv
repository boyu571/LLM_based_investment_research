Hindsight always allows people to make the best picks, but it’s a little different when you’re looking to the future. People are apprehensive about the future, and they tend to think that certain types of technology, even new trends, are going to fizzle as fads. Are crypto-currencies here to stay? No one can tell the future. Yet these digital currencies look like a great example of a new type of technology that is here to stay, at least for quite some time. Even buy and hold investors know that they aren’t holding onto stocks for a lifetime. Buffet even buys and sells. Therefore, the fact that these crypto-currencies represent a viable buy and hold opportunity for a time suggests that perhaps it’s time for investors to pay attention. There are certainly all types of investments to choose from, many of them generating nice returns these days. So why digital currencies? Some of the returns that crypto-currencies have been producing in recent years have been astronomical. You had to have been avoiding the news not to see what happened to BTC or Bitcoin in 2017 and early 2018.  IMAGE: PEXELS You could say the same thing about ETH or Ethereum, and a lesser-known digital currency, too, XRP or Ripple. Ripple didn’t balloon to a price that is similar to the value of a Bitcoin, but it went from selling at mere pennies to a few dollars a coin. If you do that math, that’s a huge return. Naturally, in recent months, the returns for many digital currencies have been going in the other direction. They did balloon quite a lot, and they did it quickly. Not all of them followed suit either. In fact, some crypto-currencies are duds, and that’s why you have to choose your investments wisely. Yet you’re not looking for the digital currencies you invest in to balloon to an enormous price all at once. You’re looking at the long-term opportunity, like an Amazon play. If you make a move like that, then you could end up with millions of dollars and telling others about how you got involved in crypto-currencies when they were in their infancy. That statement makes a good point. The reason why most people didn’t invest in a company like Amazon when it was in its infancy is that it wasn’t the company then that it is today. It’s easy to say investing in Amazon is a good idea today, and the share price is astronomical. The same could possibly be said about digital currencies, though we aren’t there yet. There were certainly many millionaires made when the last digital currency boom happened quickly. Yet what about the long-term? These digital currencies may not look good to every investor, just like Amazon didn’t initially look good to every investor. Yet what about later on down the road? To Regulate Or Not To Regulate One of the same principles that draw many people to digital currencies also makes them leery. How is that? The fact that crypto-currencies aren’t regulated by the government or banks is what draws many people to want to invest in them. Yet people also have the tendency to think that one day they will be regulated, and so they are hesitant, all things considered.Related Posts:10 Tips To Sell Private Label Products Like Hot Cake On…The Complete Guide For Selling Advertising On Your Blog Or…How Should A Newcomer Invest In Cryptocurrency With CEX.IO7 Reasons Why You Can Not Run A Business Without An App5 Tips You Can Follow To Save For Your Dream Car The experts say, however, that the regulation of crypto-currencies wouldn’t necessarily mean their demise. It may sound like a grand idea to have currencies that aren’t regulated, but is it really? Would currencies that are popular and subsequently regulated be better than the system that is in place now? It’s impossible to tell what is going to happen with the digital currency market. Yet you can take a good hard look and see what you think in regards to what investments you want to make. Picking a home run hitter before he becomes a home run hitter isn’t easy. That’s just a baseball analogy to help you figure out why people have such a hard time picking out the next Amazon and why they are hesitant about digital currencies. Crypto-currencies aren’t hitting home run after home run just yet, but they are in fact showing signs that they might. Three of the digital currencies have really shown those signs, and it’s hard to argue with how popular Bitcoin has become. What else is important to note? Life Application With the introduction of so many digital currencies, it makes some people wonder why there are all those choices. After all, each country only has one actual currency. Yet you have to understand the blockchain and the fact that each of these crypto-currencies is supposed to have its own real-world application. For example, Ripple is tied to the banking system. There are talks of major companies out there starting to accept digital currencies soon enough. That can make you really start to take note of the opportunity that might be in front of you right now. That doesn’t mean, however, that you get giddy about buying all those digital currencies. You have to understand your investments, and even the most savvy investors can’t always pick home run hitters before they hit home runs. If you were to try and pick the next Amazon back when, would you have picked the company or a different one? Maybe you were an investor then and tried but didn’t see it coming. It’s one thing to recognize the fact that digital currencies have the opportunity to really blow up in the future. Yet they aren’t all in the same boat. You have to think about which ones are going to do well. It’s not going to be easy to pick the winners. Just because Bitcoin has done it before doesn’t mean it will be the one to do it again. Which of the digital currencies out there right now are set to explode in the coming years as the market moves in that direction?

But according to Jean-Claude Juncker, this is what is ahead for the euro.In this State of the Union address this week, the President of the European Commission argued that the euro should replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency, with a plan promised by the end of the year.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The euro? For real? A currency that has been declining steadily in its share of global reserves? There is more chance of the Iraqi dinar taking over the world. In truth, by re-heating that tired rhetoric all the EU's leaders are doing is demonstrating how far from reality they keep travelling with every year that passes.Challenging what the former French President, Valery Giscard D'Estaing, once described as the 'exorbitant privilege' of the dollar has long been an ambition of Europe's committed federalists. Controlling the world's reserve currency not only helped the American economy, they argued.It solidified that country's dominance of world trade. Replacing it was one of the explicit goals behind the creation of the single currency.The euro-zone, with a larger population and equal economic weight to the United States, would usurp the dollar's role, and capture all the economic advantages that came with it.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Juncker was banging that drum with renewed vigour this week. ""It is absurd that Europe pays for 80 per cent of its energy import bill – worth 300 billion euro a year – in US dollars when only roughly 2 per cent of our energy imports come from the United States,"" he complained.""It is absurd that European companies buy European planes in dollars instead of euros. This is why, before the end of the year, the Commission will present initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro. The euro must become the face and the instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe"".There will be plenty of support for that around the rest of the continent. By Friday, the Spanish foreign minister was pushing the same line, and no doubt many other presidents and finance ministers will chime in with similar statements.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Photo / APBy Christmas we'll see what the actual plan is. One thing is certain, however. It has a heck of a long way to go. A report this summer from the European Central Bank (ECB), hardly a biased source, admitted that, far from growing in importance, the euro is actually shrinking.Related articlesBusinessHell on the high seas: $5m cruise stuff-up14 Sep 05:49 AMBusinessMeridian Energy axes 'unjustifiable' prompt payment discounts16 Sep 08:22 PMBusinessHerald and NZME sweep awards14 Sep 07:05 PMBusinessSneaky messages buried in company logos15 Sep 12:14 AMSoon after the currency was launched in 1999, it accounted for 20 per cent of global reserves. By 2003/4, it was close to 25 per cent. But after that, it stalled and then went into reverse. By last year, the euro accounted for just 19.9 per cent of global reserves, the lowest level since launch, and this year it showed no significant improvement. It has fallen by 3 percentage points since 2009.On other measures, such as share of international loans or global deposits, it is declining as well, according to the ECB.Indeed, the euro doesn't appear to be any more significant than the currencies it replaced.Back in 1990 and 1991, according to Bundesbank data, the German deutschmark by itself accounted for 19 per cent of global reserves (although it fell back to a more normal 14.5 per cent by 1996, after a few tens of billions were blown trying to defend the ill-fated Exchange Rate Mechanism). That is about where the euro is now.Even the old French franc accounted for 2.4 per cent of global reserves in the 1990s.This means that the euro accounts for a smaller proportion of global reserves than the combined share of the currencies it replaced. Instead of enhancing Europe's role in the global monetary system, it has diminished it.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The reasons for this are not exactly hard to work out. Sure, the euro has been patched up in the last few years. But it came close to collapse in the last crisis and may easily do so again in the next.A populist government in Italy is threatening to break all the budget guidelines and has discussed plans for a parallel currency as a way out of the euro.None of the faultiness have been fixed, and Emanuel Macron's plans for reform have already come to nothing.Germany's trade surplus has ballooned into one of the largest the world has ever seen, to the extent that it is now a major threat to economic stability.And, perhaps worst of all, even after two trillion euros of printed cash, growth remains anaemic, and there is little sign of a new wave of entrepreneurial companies to revive the eurozone's economy.The dollar faces serious challenges. Under an erratic president, it is abdicating global leadership. Even with robust growth this year, its share of global GDP is in relentless decline.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Over the next decade, you can make a case that Bitcoin may over-take it. So might the Chinese yuan. Or some version of blockchain technology that Amazon or Apple are working on.But the euro? Forget it.

If anything, Cardano has a bearish outlook that’s unless there is a high-volume break and close above 7 cents later today. Latest Cardano News It’s true that there is a positive correlation between altcoins including Cardano and Bitcoin. Dominating at more than 55 percent at the time of press, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson told Mpho Dagada that was it not for Bitcoin, we would not have Cardano, a platform that wants to change the way smart contracting is executed. Thanks to the Cypriot Crisis in late 2012-2013, the event propelled the Bitcoin prices from almost zero to $250 giving it a pass to the media which in turn funneled as these investors keen on exploring the “amazing” technology and digital money.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  The banking crisis in Cyprus did create problems but it was instead a platform for Charles Hoskinson to be a force in the crypto space which made him possible to create IOHK, Dan Larimer of EOS and Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum. Since then, Cardano as an idea has been evolving. Currently, the team is even talking of developing solutions that continue to be problematic in the Bitcoin ecosystem. That of UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Output. Besides, the platform under the Byron Stage is planning on Marlowe, a templating language platform with smart contracting capabilities.

What this means is that last week’s solid candlestick is still a shadow for recent bullish events and could hamper recovery. In any case anyway, last week remains an important candlestick in our analysis. It was a bearish engulfing bar breaking below 9 cents and retesting ADA’s ATLs at 7 cents. The level as we have seen in previous Cardano price analysis is an important support level for Cardano price and was broken early this week.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  As such, though there is a minor shift in sentiment, Cardano buyers are yet to shake off sell pressure. Going forward, Cardano prices might collapse and print new lows in coming days. Daily Cardano Price Chart Daily Cardano Price Chart by Trading View Considering the development of Sep 12, Cardano prices did recover on Sep 13. On Sep 12, a bear pin bar printed with abnormally high trading volumes The result was a three-bar bullish reversal pattern, the Morning Star. However, ADA is yet to close above 7 cents signaling shift of trend. Instead, yesterday’s lower time frame consolidation means our Cardano sells hold true. Unless otherwise Cardano prices recover and hit stops at 8 cents, our previous Cardano price prediction will be valid.

A sell-off through the late morning led Bitcoin Cash to an early afternoon intraday low $439.2, steering clear of the day’s first major support level at $438.03 before a partial recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was up 0.55% to $449.5, with Bitcoin moving from a start of a day low $445.9 to a morning high $457.4 before easing back, the day’s major support and resistance levels left untested. For the day ahead, moving back through the morning high would support a run at $460 levels to bring the day’s first major resistance level at $468.33 into play, though Bitcoin Cash will need to move through and hold above $453 in the early part of the day to support the beginnings of a weekend rally. Failure to move back through to $450 levels could see Bitcoin Cash hit reverse later in the day, with a pullback through the morning low $445.9 brining sub-$440 levels and the day’s first major support level at $431.33 into play, though we would expect Bitcoin Cash to steer clear of the day’s major support levels barring materially negative news hitting the wires. {alt}Litecoin Bucks the TrendLitecoin gained 2.99% on Friday, following Thursday’s 5.83% rally, to end the day at $56.23, two consecutive days of gains leading Litecoin into positive territory for the week, Litecoin up 2.42% Monday through Friday. A relatively choppy start to the day saw Litecoin pullback from a morning high $55.01 to an early afternoon intraday low $52.92 before finding support, the day’s low steering clear of the first major support level at $52.27. Litecoin rebounded through afternoon, breaking through the day’s first major resistance level at $56.27 and second major resistance level at $57.94 to an intraday high $58.9, before easing back to $56 levels, Litecoin bucking the trend across the broader market on the day.Story continues At the time of writing, Litecoin was up 0.37% to $56.54, with Litecoin tracking the broader market in the early hours, rising to a morning high $57.82 before easing back, the morning’s low $56.05 coming at the start of the day. For the day ahead, holding on to $56 levels through the morning would support another run at $58 levels, to bring the day’s first major resistance level at $59.11 into play, though we would expect Litecoin to struggle to break through to $59 levels on the day. Failure to hold on to $56 levels through the morning could see Litecoin pullback through the morning low $56.05 to bring sub-$55 levels into play, while Litecoin will likely steer clear of the day’s first major support level at $53.13, barring particularly negative news hitting the wires.  {alt}Ripple on the DefensiveRipple’s XRP slipped by 1.18% on Friday, partially reversing Thursday’s 3.5% gain, to end the day at $0.27618, the Friday pullback leaving Ripple’s XRP down 0.34% for the week, Monday through Friday.A bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP move through to an early morning intraday high $0.28523, the day’s high coming within reach of the day’s first major resistance level at $0.2877 before pulling back, a late morning reversal seeing Ripple’s XRP fall to an early afternoon intraday low $0.271. Recovering to an afternoon high $0.28213, Ripple’s XRP was unable to hold on to gains by the day’s end, with Ripple’s XRP now having failed to close out at $0.28 levels since 7th September. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up 0.53% to $0.27745. Moves through the early morning left the day’s major support and resistance levels untested, with Ripple’s XRP hitting a morning high $0.28 before easing back to hold just above a start of a day morning low $0.27599. For the day ahead, holding above $0.275 through the morning would support another run at $0.28 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $0.2839 into play, with any broad based market rally likely to support a run at $0.29 levels, though we would expect Ripple’s XRP to struggle to hold on to $0.29 levels in the event of a move. Failure to hold above $0.275 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse later in the day, with the day’s first major support level at $0.2697 certainly in play, though we would expect plenty of support at sub-$0.27 levels for Ripple’s XRP to avoid the day’s major support levels, unless the broader market gets hit with dire news from regulators. {alt} Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency InstantlyThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE: Natural Gas Price Forecast – natural gas markets fall hard on Friday  Gold Weekly Price Forecast – Gold undecided for the week  Natural Gas Weekly Price Forecast – natural gas has an ugly week  EUR/USD Weekly Price Forecast – Euro rallies for the week  Crude Oil Price Forecast – crude oil volatile for Friday session  EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro rolls over on Friday session ",2018-09-15

I mean, what do you say to that? So I give them the sad Dad headshake and turn away.“No wait,” E straightens up, “what it was really like?”“Seriously,” M hiccups, “tell us your story. It’s not like we’re kids anymore.”“Think of it as a history lesson,’ says E who knows how to set the Dad trap. “C’mon,” and they’re patting the couch like they did when they were little girls at bedtime.“Okay,” I shrug, “But I’ll stand for this one. Four decades, one take, no interruptions.”They settle down and raise their shining faces.“Picture this,” I begin. “It’s summer 1987. In your hand is a Motorola 8000X, the world’s first mobile phone. Costs 3,000 quid and it’s the size of a brick, so heavy you have to coat check it at nightclubs.”""Like in American Psycho,"" says M.“No interrupting!” E elbows her and I move on.“You’re standing on a trading floor in London in the middle of a bull market that will run to the next millennium. In a few years’ time you’ll be a Master of the Universe, but you don’t know that yet. All you know is you breezed through five interviews and now you’re a rookie trader. You’re buying and selling a hybrid, a cross species debt plus equity mongrel that no one seems to fully understand. Your technology is a Reuters screen, two phones pinned to the desk and somewhere on the other side of the floor is a clunky grey box called a Black-Scholes option calculator. Now you’re a smart graduate, but you’re no mathematician and neither is anyone else on the floor. So how do you know what these things are really worth?""Every day you trade in live markets across countries and currencies. Every night you're in the bar. You rely on tangible and intangible data to make a price: historical performance, liquidity, market sentiment, the footprint of buyers and sellers and the size of your hangover. You write blue tickets for buy, pink tickets for sell and drop them in a tray. But you're starting to understand that markets are all about stories: Japanese real estate, an emerging economy, a stock chart, a yield curve – you can run all the numbers you like, but in the end it's a leap of faith. What you actually do as buyer or seller depends on which story you decide to believe. This is your first big life lesson, but you don't know that yet, you just know it's October 1987 and the Dow Jones is in freefall, down 22 per cent in a single day. You see things that are not supposed to happen: crazy prices, total illiquidity, fear. You learn that in times of crisis you can throw away the rulebook. You understand what Newton meant back in 1720 when he dropped a packet in the South Sea bubble: 'I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.' You think your first crash is like losing your virginity, that life will never be the same again. In fact, this is your second life lesson: the art of survival, how to live to tell the tale. October 1987 turns out to be just a blip and the bull roars on.""Fast forward to 1991 and you're out in Docklands where the trading floor is the size of an aircraft hangar. You're using email now but you're not browsing because there's still no world wide web. And there's a new species on the trading floor – the maths and physics postdocs who've been lured out of academia. You call them the quants, the quantitative analysts who are building the math model that will tell you what your hybrids are actually worth. They huddle together talking stochastics and volatility. They don't have phones so their desks look kind of naked. But when you all sit in a meeting room there are problems in communication. The problem is the word value – the definition of what that might be. These guys live in a theoretical bubble. They've never been in business, never bought or sold anything, never met an investor or witnessed market madness. Some of them seem like they've never been outside the door. They have trouble making eye contact and there's no banter. You're worried about variables and assumptions, about everything that's not in their model. It's all so elegant, but experience has already taught you that the biggest risk factor in any scenario is likely to be human. And if you keep on asking questions you'll be misheard as a sceptic or considered too stupid to handle the math.Financial engineering is the hot story and it's become an article of faith“The arrival of the quants is the evolutionary equivalent of the transition to bipeds. But this cultural revolution won’t get discussed in the public domain until 2008 when the wheels come off. From now on, your world is divided into the bankers and the geeks. They don’t speak the same language or think the same way but for the moment, the bankers are in charge and they have to trust the geeks to deliver the glittering returns. In the years that follow you make a fortune for the bank and for yourself. Proprietary trading is what management wants and they keep cranking up your risk limits. Mathematical models pave the way for bigger trades, new instruments and much greater layers of complexity. It’s a period of astonishing creativity and innovation. Hedge funds blossom. Financial engineering is the hot story and it’s become an article of faith.“All around you there’s a transformation in attitudes towards risk and customers. Big profits breed arrogance and contempt and people start believing they’re in possession of a superior truth. Customers become the ‘pretty stupid people who understand nothing’– which is how one bank refers to its clients. And they don’t mean the little people, they mean the fund managers, insurance companies and corporate treasurers who buy instruments they don’t really understand because they promise spectacular returns. Sometimes you wonder where it’s all going to end and you’re not the only one who is anxious. Already in 1992, the president of the Federal Reserve warns that derivatives ‘must be understood by top management as well as by traders and rocket scientists – I hope this sounds like a warning because it is’. But greed is a kind of madness and who wants to call time on a party?""In 1998 you're eating a banana at your desk when the news breaks that the smartest guys in the room have blown up: Long Term Capital Management, the king of hedge funds with $126 billion in assets and two Nobel prize winners among the partners. Their strategy – to quote one of the partners – was relative value convergence trading. 'You identify cheap assets and try to hedge as many of the systematic risk factors that are associated, so that all you are left with is the pure cheapness itself.' Nothing unusual about that, but the important words here are risk factor: the definition of what that could be. On August 17th Russia devalues the rouble and defaults on its debt. This is your black swan. It triggers instant panic across the financial sector and a stampede for the exit. Four days later, LTCM drops $550 mill in one day. But it's not Russia that's the problem, it's the fact that banks and hedge funds are scrambling to liquidate all sorts of positions. Time will vindicate LTCM's strategy but right now, time has just run out. All that matters is the story that people believe: LTCM is going down. When they drop another half billion the Fed organises a bailout and a $4.4 billion hit is taken. $1.9 billion of the capital was the partners' own money – these guys really believed.“Ten years on, LTCM will look like an early warning signal and the best lesson never learnt – by the Fed, by Wall Street and just about everyone else. The 2008 global financial crisis is a clusterfuck, a toxic convergence of plotlines: incompetence, greed and complacency. To be more specific: financial engineering plus catastrophic management failure plus negligent government plus lax regulation plus a short-term compensation culture and a zombie electorate out shopping.""All around you it's carnage, like your world is being eaten alive from within. You stand in a cold sweat looking out across the floor and it feels like that scene in Alien, like you've all just been incubating the seeds of your own destruction. Next thing you know it's September 15th, 2008 and you're carrying your heart in a cardboard box across the concourse with the world's TV in your face. Lehman Brothers, 140 years of legacy razed to the ground and this funeral procession will stalk your dreams forever. You're out of a job, drifting like a zombie through your former life, a casualty of war, licking your wounds, spinning your wheels. In the limbo world of non-banking, you uncover a twilight zone of people who work like dogs for a pittance and you wonder: how do they live? Your cash burn is insane, you trawl through the household expenditure and discover your wife's brow maintenance is 300 quid a month! Christmas Eve you're out drinking with your best old friend from school when he asks how does it feel to be a social pariah? He's joking but you're three shots in and it's an ugly moment, that testosterone throb in your fist. You are that close, but you fold yourself into a cab home where you prowl round the house with a burning need to hurt something. Your wife is sobbing on the couch when you smash a Venetian glass, then somehow your hand is level with her face and she's suddenly still as a deer, steeling her chin. Like she's ready, like she's maybe even willing you on. And you understand in that moment she wants to be slapped, so the 50 per cent divorce hit will become a no-contest clean out. Your hand falls away and those lips that you will never taste again say, 'I always knew you were the wrong trade'.“You drive away, consider your options, stalled in the car at midnight in the gloom of Pembroke Square. Assets and liabilities, the soon-to-be ex-wife, the girls. Oh, your little girls! You have a cry, fall asleep in the car and wake up at dawn to watch your life drizzling away on the windscreen.“In the years that follow your comrades in arms are busy telling their stories, because after the fire fighting comes the flag waving and ambulance chasing. There’s the CEO of Morgan Stanley telling students at Wharton how you lead a bank out of a crisis and tell the Federal Reserve to ‘get fucked’. There’s an ex-partner from LTCM at MIT telling students he’s disturbed by ‘sound bites about greed and hubris’, by an ‘anti-intellectualism’ that suggests ‘rational economic thinking and models just don’t make sense’.""There's a professor of financial engineering at Columbia writing a Hippocratic oath for quants and an article in the Journal of Derivatives saying 'there is no truly reliable science beneath financial engineering . . . variables such as volatility and liquidity are crude proxies for complex human behaviours . . . models are reliable only as long as the sea stays calm. When crowds panic, anything can happen'.“Your divorce lawyer’s telling stories about wives dumping banker husbands while they’re still fit enough to snare another one who might actually get a bonus. But no one wants to hear your story about downsizing your house, your cars, your whole life. You do your time in the wilderness of bucket shop brokerage, that night with those hookers playing Blow under the table, oh Christ, that was the low point. You are shrinkwrapped in resilience now, survival is like a second skin. But you never, ever would have guessed that 2008 would be just another plot beat, because look at you now: 10 years on and you’re the Crypto King!""If you want to make money, start a religion. So said L Ron Hubbard and Scientology was born and a bunch of Hollywood crazies started throwing money at him. If you want to make money you've got to make people believe – in a tulip or a magical coin, it doesn't have to matter so long as it's a good story. Cryptocurrency is like a gift that falls out of the sky, out of the ether comes a fantasy and it's FOMO in finance, with people worried they're missing out on a dead cert. It has all the quality of fable, with a missing person inventor, it's hip and maverick and oh so now. A big Fuck You to the establishment that makes people feel they're sticking it to The Man – the banks, regulators and everyone else who failed them.“So instead of placing their trust in institutions governed by the rule of law, they put their faith in magical thinking. For sure, it’s tulips times one hundred, except it’s much worse and it’s like a contagion. You thought the Nineties dot com boom was wild but it was nothing compared to this. Least then you were a stakeholder so if the business flourished you actually owned something – like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. Let me tell you, when educated rational persons – accountants, lawyers, engineers and philosophers tell you they’ve bought a little Bitcoin “just because’, you know we’re back in cowboy country. It’s digital lawlessness and it could lead us to another cliff edge, but you live long enough you learn to imagine things before they happen.You and the ex can even laugh now about that almost-slap back in 2008“These days you mostly think about how you’ll teach your future grandkids to be safe. Number one: Get your pronouns right with robots. They don’t have feelings, they haven’t got souls. Sometimes you wonder if you have one yourself. You watch the Curiosity Rover late at night for its peacefulness, contemplating a future you won’t live to see. Just imagine – your grandkids could be homemakers on Mars! There’s no doubt humans are marvellous and terrifying all in one.""When you look back you get reflective. Your two girls are tucked up in tech, smart as whips and, despite the divorce, you believe they've had good parenting. You and the ex can even laugh now about that almost-slap back in 2008 – well, she smiles and you wince at the pop-up memory, because you will never, ever forget what she said that night. Though truth is, you only married for a bet. And you hope she's told the full story to your girls because they need to understand how men can be. She was on the milk round, we only called her in because she was hot and R bet you 500 quid you wouldn't, so you walked in and looked into those green eyes and said 'You're never getting this job, so let me take you out to dinner'. 'Sure,' she smiled and fell pregnant in a heartbeat. You might have guessed then she was the kind of woman would dump you at the first whiff of burning tyres. But hey, no regrets, look how it well it all worked out.""You always said finance was a human drama and now Lehman Brothers is back on stage, the hot ticket at the National. The punters love it but this band of brothers story is too soft focus for you and gutburn has you squirming in your seat. You get a little broody but the past is so over for you now. You've straddled two centuries so you know people don't get smarter. Human nature doesn't change and that's the final lesson. History is mistakes repeated and best lessons never learnt. The trick is to keep riding the peaks and troughs and telling a story, because we all just want to believe.""

Last Time the Bulls Ran, This Time We’re Looking at a Stampede There is no doubt about it, 2018 has been something of a reality check for many bitcoin enthusiasts. The exuberance of last year’s epic bull market seems to have largely given way to pessimism, and market sentiment surrounding the space is less optimistic than it ever has been in the memory of many participants.

The number one cryptocurrency has grabbed the attention of some of the traditional financial industry’s largest institutions and where once was scepticism, intrigue can now be found. In the remainder of 2018 and going forward into 2019, there are many events upcoming that could well spark a bull run that will likely dwarf those all before it.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Firstly, there is the Bakkt platform with backing from the ICE, along with Microsoft and Starbucks. The new product is expected to make getting exposure to BTC easier than ever before for both retail and institutional investors. It is set to launch this November. Likewise, Goldman Sachs are still exploring how to bring both a trading desk and a custody solution to market. These two developments from such an established name will surely inspire confidence amongst other financial institutions that bitcoin is not going to disappear any time soon. In addition, there seems to be considerable interest coming from the clients of financial heavyweights Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Both are in the process of launching futures and derivative products surrounding BTC. These developments are thought by many to be capable of bringing stability to the highly volatile asset class. This will in turn make investing in bitcoin more appealing to those with the financial clout to drive prices sky high.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Even the various Crypto ETF’s proposed to the SEC have been given renewed hope through the appointment of Elad Roisman to the position of commissioner. Roisman is known to be supportive of cryptocurrencies and his nomination by President Trump and subsequent inclusion in the regulatory body can only be positive for the digital asset space going forward. Away from mainstream financial interest in bitcoin, there are also exciting developments underway from a technical standpoint. The Lightning Network continues to make advances and more channels open by the day. The upgrade should allow bitcoin to handle a far greater number of transactions when the next bull run does kick off. During the 2017 market surge, a lot of doubt was cast over the usability of the bitcoin protocol because fees rocketed at the same time as the price did. This was certainly responsible for many exploring alt-coin markets since they thought bitcoin would remain too expensive for practical use. There’s a lot going on and any one of these events could provide the catalyst to send prices upwards in a meaningful way. Together, it seems more of a case of when rather than if bitcoin will surpass its current all-time high. Once the ball is in motion, the hype train gets running and, as always, more people get exposed to and learn about the disruptive potential of bitcoin. The future is certainly bright for bitcoin.

That said, hard forks have proven contentious for various crypto communities, with the possible outcome of community division being a blockchain split.According to Grin's pseudonymous lead developer Igno Peverell:""What we're worried about is our early years and the potential first-mover advantage that would come with an ASIC manufacturer producing rigs ready on our first day. This would lead to an extremely centralized mining market.""Peverell's concerns are echoed by many in the cryptocurrency community these days.Critics see ASICs as a centralizing force, not only because the expensive technology typically outpaces individual GPU miners, making the network group into just a few mining pools, but also because, currently, just one company, Bitmain, produces nearly all the cryptocurrency mining ASICs.While some cryptocurrency projects are trying to oust the hardware altogether, other communities are going head-to-head with the Chinese mining giant, hoping to create some competition. Grin, on the other hand, only cares about limiting their use on its network in the short-term.""I think what's interesting for everyone to realize, and that was maybe not true yet a year ago, is that ASICs have essentially won,"" Peverell said.But still, Peverell thinks allowing ASICs to take over the mining market immediately after Grin's launch – which is expected by the end of the year – could set the cryptocurrency project back.And so he and other Grin developers are hoping to buy some time, for a time when there's a more competitive ASICs market.One hard fork after anotherWhile some in the crypto space would likely be leery about upgrading a cryptocurrency's consensus algorithm every six months, Grin developers think the network can handle it.That's partly because Grin is already planning to hard fork, to introduce new features to the blockchain, on that timeline for the first couple of years anyway. In that way, adding a consensus change to the mix probably wouldn't be that straining.That said, the developers do think making hard forks a permanent part of the blockchain's existence would be dangerous.""We do not want to keep hard forking Grin regularly for governance and policy reasons,"" Peverell said. ""We believe regular hard forks would bring too much centralization pressure.""The centralization pressure he's talking about there, though, is as it relates to users, then, having to go along with whatever the lead developers and biggest players support in an effort to keep the blockchain from splitting.As such, the Grin developer team decided to limit these hard forks. Once those two years are over, they ultimately want to permanently switch to what's called the Cuckoo Cycle proof-of-work algorithm, unique in that it requires the machines mining to use more memory than other proof-of-work algorithms.At this point, they fully expect ASICs to crop up, but hopefully, a more diverse group of ASICs, built by a number of companies, which they believe will lead to a healthier Grin ecosystem.""[That's] why we decided to limit to a reasonable period, enough to let the Cuckoo Cycle ASIC mature and let multiple players emerge, but not so long that regular hard forks would start becoming a problem,"" Peverell told CoinDesk.#DontBeaDickWhile there's been some debate over the idea on the Grin forum, the cryptocurrency's most active community members – called the ""technomity"" – agree the two-year plan is the best way forward.""We still have a few parameters to refine before we can finalize it, and then it will be left to the council to vote and project developers to implement,"" Peverell said.Although, despite all this careful planning, other worries are cropping up that ""secret ASICs"" could thwart the idea.Siacoin lead developer David Vorick told Grin developers he's worried that ASIC manufacturers will be able to easily tweak their hardware with painless software updates in an effort to keep functioning on a network with a changing algorithm.According to Vorick, who is himself in the center of a similar drama involving ASICs mining siacoin, investors and future miners have been inquiring about making ASICs especially for Grin, in an effort to get a competitive edge before the blockchain launches.""I can't emphasize enough how damaging secret ASICs can be for a coin and its mining community, so this was quite upsetting to hear,"" Peverell said.He added that the Grin developer team tweaked the crypto's algorithm based on Vorick's suggestions.BlockCypher CEO and co-founder Catheryne Nicholson confirmed in an email to all developers working on iterations of the MimbleWimble idea that Vorick is right: Investors are indeed trying to make ASICs for Grin.It's something Nicholson isn't happy about.""Personally, I find that disgusting,"" she wrote, continuing:""Rather than funding the open-source development work directly, they would rather pursue something that one, would destroy the ecosystem before it has a chance to develop and two, is so self-serving while riding off the backs of people who have done all the work.""Because of this, BlockCypher is dedicating its resources to Grin's developers by way of their new mining pool, Grinmint.Clearly, a bit peeved about the situation, Nicholson concluded her post with the hashtag ""DontBeaDick.""Razor wire image via Shutterstock",2018-09-15

""It was exactly the opposite.""He added:""They look at it as an opportunity to enter when things are not too frothy.""Many of the local staff members were hired away from traditional financial institutions such as the New York Stock Exchange, Barclays, and Citigroup.New York ""is an incredibly deep pool of talent,"" White said during an event Thursday celebrating the opening of its first permanent location in the city (it previously had employees working out of a WeWork there).""We have to create a bridge between financial services and technology,"" he went on. ""In order to do that, we need to pull from some of the best and brightest minds that have worked their whole careers in other kinds of traditional financial firms.""Institutional and retailTo make corporate clients comfortable when they visit, the office has a security staff comparable to the NYSE's, according to Coinbase's co-head of institutional sales, Christine Sandler, who previously worked at the Big Board.And yet, Sandler said Coinbase's institutional custody, asset management, and trading services shouldn't be seen as conflicting with its previous focus on retail investors. To the contrary, in her mind, institutional distribution is the key to mainstream adoption.""We want to partner with appropriate institutions to help the whole ecosystem grow,"" she told CoinDesk. ""It's not 'institutional or retail,' because a lot of these institutions will be distributors.""Stepping back, Coinbase as a company has been on a hiring spree all through the 2018 bear market, and now has more than 500 employees worldwide. And New York isn't the only new office attracting institutional clients and recruits.Coinbase is looking to ""light up more countries and more fiat rails"" with an eye on expansion in Asia and Latin America ""pretty quickly,"" White said. Coinbase already started establishing an office in Tokyo this summer, hiring a small team and applying for a Financial Services Agency certification in Japan.""We're committed to not being a U.S. company,"" White said.Photo courtesy of Coinbase: Adam White of Coinbase Institutional (R), New York City Economic Development Corporation CEO James Patchett, and Coinbase chief compliance officer Jeff Horowitz (L)",2018-09-15

As an example, he cites Anthony Di Iorio, a co-founder of ethereum who went on to launch and fund other companies in the space.“Another great example is the founder of Aion, who realized there was an opportunity to build on what ethereum had done and try to do certain things better, such as scaling blockchain platforms and enabling interoperability between different platforms,” says Mr. Tapscott. “Now Aion is one of the leading platforms in the world, with a footprint that extends well beyond our shores to every corner of the globe.”Canada could up its game in academic research and training for blockchain, says Mr. Tapscott. While there’s a lot of research going on in companies, universities need to step up their efforts in research as well as in offering programs to train the next generation of blockchain developers and entrepreneurs, he says.William Mougayar, author of The Business Blockchain and managing partner and chief investment officer at Geneva-based JM3 Capital, says there’s also room for improvement in the country’s regulatory environment. In particular, Canada’s stance on initial coin offerings – the use of cryptocurrencies to raise money for business – has put a damper on the digital currencies and blockchain market, he says.“As a result of that, many companies are leaving and seeking jurisdictions that are more welcoming to the digital token phenomena,” says Mr. Mougayar.Mr. Tapscott says growing Canada’s blockchain industry has implications that go beyond buying and selling cryptocurrencies.“From a national perspective, Canada has been a resource-driven economy for 100 years,” he says. “As we’re entering into the second digital age – the first age was the arrival of the internet and the rise of computers – we’ve got an opportunity to become a leader in blockchain, which will power the new infrastructure for the internet.”This new, blockchain-powered infrastructure will be a digital medium for value in the same way that the internet is a digital medium for information.Mr. Cassidy provides examples of other applications for blockchain: supply chain management systems where all the parties can see where all items are in the system, “micro-payment” transactions between devices connected over the internet, and real-estate transactions. “There’s a litany of applications,” he says.To strengthen its position as a blockchain leader, Canada needs to do more to educate its citizens, says Mr. Cassidy. Government support for the industry is crucial, he says.“We need universities to start offering courses to young minds because the biggest issue in blockchain is lack of talent,” says Mr. Cassidy. “We also need to be getting more pilot projects set up and we need to be breaking bread with companies looking to push this narrative forward.”",2018-09-15

""In antiquity, it was a library that could answer any question and hosted all the collective knowledge of the world at that time."" Advertisement   Advertisement  Various studies suggest female voices are perceived as more ""cordial""While Rausch didn't elaborate further on the trials used to ascertain that female voices were preferred, he did state that the trials showed we generally opt for women to assist us and that we find their voices more agreeable — a finding that echoes numerous other studies that were carried out well before language assistants came along.In  an experiment  by the University of Indiana, researchers found that both men and women have a preference for female voices over male or computer voices, and that they find the former more cordial.                                        Amazon's profits depend on whether we see Alexa as ""nice"" — an enjoyable user experience makes it more probable that users will feel inclined to make purchases.                                                                                        Amazon                                                        This preference apparently stems from the fact that the voice automatically triggers certain stereotypical expectations in our minds, according to  a study  by Stanford University.While the study highlights that we identify with and relate better to machines if they're assigned any gender, it also underlines that we impose stereotypes onto machines depending on the gender of the voice — in other words, we perceive computers as ""helpful"" and ""caring"" when they're programmed with the voice a woman. Advertisement   Advertisement  It turns out a nice voice can really be good for businessTech companies clearly seemed to have picked up on this strategy and it's working well for them: according to a survey by market researcher Norstat, around 90% of users are satisfied with Alexa's, Cortana's, Siri's, and the Google Assistant's respective voices — and those 90% are particularly important to Amazon.The reason for this is simply that, whether or not we perceive Alexa as ""pleasant"" has a direct impact on Amazon's profits — the company doesn't actually earn that much on the sale of the Echo devices; it makes more from people using the devices through shopping and data.By making Alexa a female, she seems more like a friendly older sister or girlfriend we — apparently — prefer interacting with, shopping with, and asking for help, rather than a computer, making it more likely we'll make purchases.

Brendan Eich on Brave and the Current Internet Economy You may not know his name, but nearly every time you browse the internet, chances are you’re running into technology the founder of Brave Browser and its native cryptocurrency token BAT created. Programmer and serial tech entrepreneur Brendan Eich created the programming language JavaScript, which along with HTML and CSS make up the core technologies powering today’s internet.

According to Eich, the current internet’s current monetization system is “mature, but troubled,” suggesting that the human attention economy through the Basic Attention Token will eventually replace the need for fund-raising through sites like Patreon or through traditional programmatic digital advertising exchanges. “The Basic Attention Token is an ERC20 token on Ethereum designed to be a unit of account of human attention in a reformed and private system of internet advertising and anonymous contributions. This system could replace the current web digital ad system which has a number of problems,” Eich explained.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Eich says the current $200 billion global advertising industry is “inefficient” due to the scale of the web. Because publishers and other websites rely on ad exchanges, “excessive fees” are involved due to so many middlemen having a hand in the process. Worse, Eich says, are the prominence of malware distributors who “buy cheap ad spaces and put cuddly disguised exploit-kit loaders and fake ads.” “You also get the counterpart abuse which is ad-fraud where fake publishers, fake humans played by bots, take ad-revenue,” Eich added. The Brave Browser blocks advertisements and website tracking cookies by default, and lets users opt to pay their favorite content creators and publishers with the Basic Attention Token. Brave Software is also developing a solution that allows users to opt into advertisements sold by Brave.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Given Eich’s track record of creating disruptive new internet technologies, Brave Browser and BAT have the potential to forever change the internet economy and create a better, safer user experience for all internet users. Switching BAT’s Blockchain If Ethereum Fails The JavaScript creator was asked what would happen if Ethereum, the blockchain the ERC20-based Basic Attention Token is built on, were to fail. While Eich doesn’t see that happening, he says “it could be done.” “That would be a big mess if we did it. I mean, it could be done, it would be like a wartime rescue operation. And I don’t see Ethereum under that kind of wartime threat right now,” Eich explained. Ethereum’s price has suffered in recent days, and just last week reached a one-year low of under $170, giving investors an uncertain outlook for the future of the number two ranked cryptocurrency by market cap.  Brave Browser Founder: Smart Investors “HODL” When pressed by the London Letter on his thoughts around the current bear market cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and BAT are currently experiencing, Eich suggested he and his team do like other “smart investors,” saying “we HODL.” “I think that’s what people should do with crypto if they have conviction… So we’re pretty much ignoring the market conditions,” Eich said. Regardless of the bear market, Eich and his team plan to press forward and “try to fulfill the vision of the utility token that we articulated.” Tags: Basic Attention TokenBATBrave BrowserBrave SoftwareBrendan EichethereumfirefoxjavascriptMozilla ",2018-09-15

The hearing comes as the U.S. government and regulatory agencies step up their crackdown on cryptocurrency-related fraud. A District Court Judge in Connecticut sentenced 33-year-old Josh Garza to a 21-month prison sentence followed by six months of house arrest for his role in a Ponzi scheme based around the issuance of a cryptocurrency – called PayCoin – which entitled investors to a portion of another company’s mining profits. The scheme was conducted between May of 2014 and January of 2015 through four companies owned by Garza. These companies sold the rights and access to cryptocurrency mining operations and allowed investors to buy a portion of these operations through “PayCoin “and “Hashlets,” which claimed to give investors the rights to a portion of the profits from the mining operations.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  John Durham, the U.S. District Attorney for Connecticut, spoke about the scheme, saying that “hashlet customers, or investors, were buying the rights to profit from a slice of the computing power owned by the companies.” Although the operation seems legitimate on the surface, Garza made multiple claims that should have raised red flags for investors, including the guarantee that the price of the virtual currency wouldn’t drop below $20 per unit, because the company would prop the price using their $100 million digital currency reserve. After pleading guilty for defrauding investors and committing wire fraud, Garza was ordered to pay full restitution to all the investors that had lost their entire investments after the operations were found to be illegitimate.

Judge Raymond Dearie, the judge handling the case, commented on his ruling, saying that:     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  “Congress’ purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called… Stripped of the 21st-century jargon, including the defendant’s own characterization of the offered investment opportunities, the challenged indictment charges a straightforward scam, replete with the common characteristics of many financial frauds.” Following this ruling, the SEC immediately moved to shut down and charge two cryptocurrency scams that were defrauding investors. The first company charged was TokenLot, a self-described ICO superstore, that was charged with operating as an unregistered broker-dealer. The TokenLot team cooperated fully with the SEC, which led to light charges. The second company that was shut down by the SEC was a cryptocurrency hedge fund, called Crypto Asset Management LP, that had falsely claimed to investors that it was the first fully regulatory compliant crypto hedge fund. The operator of this fund, Timothy Enneking, had taken over $3 million from investors, and more than 40% of his fund’s investments were considered as securities by the SEC. It is likely that the SEC and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. will continue to crackdown on cryptocurrency-related scams in the near future. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Non-cash payments have grown 7.9 percent in 2017, according to ECB research. A number of countries have announced their plans to launch national cryptocurrencies or already conducted initial coin offerings (ICOs) to introduce a state-backed digital token. In late February, Venezuela launched Petro, an oil-backed currency, which was automatically banned by the United States. Iran followed suit and announced it will “implement the country’s first cloud-based digital currency” to counter the international sanctions it faces ever since U.S. President Trump exited the nuclear deal.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607473 = window.pid607473 || rnd;             var plc607473 = window.plc607473 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607473;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607473+';place='+(plc607473++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc452518:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_452518_""+plc452518;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], ""placement_452518_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  China is also moving towards the launch of a national cryptocurrency, although the country is known to have a very strict policy regarding cryptocurrency trading. In June, Russian Central Bank’s Deputy Chair Olga Skorobogatova said: “regulators of all countries agree that it’s time to develop national cryptocurrencies, this is the future.” Coincidentally or not, most countries who have announced national cryptocurrencies are run by authoritarian governments not keen on transparency. In June, Bitcoin developer Peter Todd explained that all currencies are digital nowadays and “cryptocurrency is not about being able to move money digitally, it’s about auditing.” “In the case of decentralised cryptocurrency, it’s about the ability to move money and audit it without permission. But when you’re talking about a government currency, obviously there’s permission, a central authority and control — end of story.” The issuance of Central Bank Digital Currencies is not exclusive to countries in tense relationships with the United States. Sweden is considering the issuance of an electronic version of its currency, called e-krona, while the Bank of England has published a paper on the matter.     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc533110 = window.plc533110 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc533110:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_533110_""+plc533110;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 533110, [728,90], ""placement_533110_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc533110++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                  Featured image from Shutterstock.

Their annualized 3.4% rise was the sharpest since September 2012 and well ahead of forecasts. This pleasant surprise for battered, rare-breed Aussie bulls, was followed shortly by yet another. August’s employment data showed job creation still running hot, with  full-time roles expanding nicely.AUD/USD even chalked up the rare feat of five straight sessions of gains. However, the difficulties which have seen the Aussie under pressure all year endure. Yes, the domestic economy performing quite well. But inflation remains low, consumer debt is still very high and the interest-rate differential in favor of the US Dollar yawns, and will yawn still wider as the Federal Reserve continues to hike.Moreover trade tensions between the US and China cannot fail to hit Australia, a country whose economic, security and political fortunes are perhaps uniquely tied to those of the two global giants. Even were that not so dramatically the case, trade tensions tend to it growth-linked currencies such as the Australian Dollar disproportionately hard. For all the current economic cheer, no change is priced into Australian interest rate futures for all of next year. Recall that the Official Cash Rate remains stuck at the 1.50% record low which has already endured unchanged since August, 2016. So, the Australian Dollar still has trouble enough, and that is likely to remain the case for as long as there is simply no evidence that domestic inflation is rising, or that trade is calming as a global worry.Still, while AUD/USD remains a strategic short, it may not fall too much further in the coming week. So it’s a cautiously neutral call from me.Resources for TradersWhether you’re new to trading or an old hand DailyFX has plenty of resources to help you.

Politics and election matters are now the major news items across the country. It is believed that by the end of this month, almost all aspects of our national existence would come to a halt until the elections are over. Interestingly, our world has become so dependent on technology that you can’t discuss elections and not mention the role of technology; whether for good or bad. The fact that we now have over 90 registered political parties is an over-stretch. How do you conduct transparent elections with over 90 political parties without technology? Election technology if properly implemented and adhered to enhances voter identification, rules out identification fraud which encourages multiple voting and makes the voting process much easier and faster.  Although technology can guarantee electoral integrity, it is dependent on the limits of the technology deployed because technology can fail and it is prone to being compromised. As a proud Nigerian citizen with my Permanent Voter Card, I wish to share a few thoughts on ways to ensure that we strengthen our electoral process and make it more acceptable. Confronting the menace of fake news       Fake news is a menace that even social media platform owners don’t know how to deal with. The Director of BBC World Service, Mr. Jamie Angus, who featured on the Sunrise Daily, Channels TV a few weeks ago, said, “…as 2019 election approaches, politicians would use opportunity to plant and spread malicious stories.” His fears have also been expressed by a number of people both within and outside the government. One thing is clear: we must confront the issue of fake news. While researching for this piece, I put a call through to the Director, Voter Education, Publicity, Gender and CSO Liaison, INEC, Oluwole Uzzi, and he said that some of the ways the commission was dealing with the challenge of fake news was through massive sensitisation, public awareness, timely release of information and access to genuine source of information. Fake news can only be curbed with the cooperation of everyone who is using one of those devices or belongs to those platforms as purveyors of fake news. As a personal example, I do not share or forward any information that I received except I am 100 per cent sure of the source. This is a personal policy that I have employed to ensure I am not part of the fake news promoters in any way possible. Proper use of PVC/Smart card reader INEC currently uses the Permanent Voter Card to facilitate voting activities in the country. Smart card readers are used to determine the authenticity of the PVC and access voter information before eligible voters are allowed to cast their votes. This election technology is good and simple for voters. Its beauty is that it perfectly complements the use of ballot papers.         However, I remember that during the last general elections, a number of Nigerians were not properly educated on how best to use these devices. It is important for INEC to engage in massive enlightenment campaign that will ensure that more people are aware of how to properly use these smart card readers. Voting with ATM cards/BVN I often wonder why we can’t vote with our ATM cards or bank verification numbers. I believe this process may work in Nigeria, particularly because of BVN policy and will likely enhance voting security and user identification. The only challenge however is that millions of Nigerians have not been captured into the financial sector and will be potentially disenfranchised.  Related News   Appeal court adjourns case seeking Buhari's removal, Atiku's declaration as president  2019 election showed Nigerians not ready for real change –Moghalu  INEC releases report on 2019 election    Experimentation with blockchain technology Considering that blockchain technology is sweeping across the world in a swift pool, several countries have begun to experiment with blockchain voting. This involves the use of voting via crypto currencies such as Bitcoin to record and audit votes. Blockchain voting enables voters to cast their votes from their smartphones from far-away distances. It eliminates voter frauds since the identity of the voter is verified using biometric tools such as a thumbprint scan when using a mobile device to vote. West Virginia is the first United States state to experiment with blockchain voting and it turned out a huge success although a small number of voters were used to try the new voting technology.       Blockchain voting was also tried in the Zug municipality of Switzerland and was recorded as successful. It is said that the US election officials are currently arranging for many Americans overseas to vote using blockchain technology in the coming November elections. Online/Internet voting Nigerians, particularly those in the Diaspora, have been clamouring for online election which is widely accepted as feasible because of its seeming simplicity. In the United States, 32 states offered online voting systems to ease the voting process for the electorates though experts warned that online voting was not secure. According to election security experts, Internet voting is fraught with risks of election/voting manipulations which may not be detectable before officials are sworn into office. “We believe that online voting, especially online voting in large scale, introduces great risk into the election system by threatening voters’ expectations of confidentiality, accountability and security of their votes and provides an avenue for malicious actors to manipulate the voting results,” Neil Jenkins, an official in the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security, United States. My concluding thought is that the 2019 general elections are going to be a herculean task for the Nigerian state, the electoral umpire, the political parties and the electorate themselves. For us to make the most of the process, we need to leverage various technologies in the entire process from planning, to implementation, sensitisation, collation of results and announcement. “The purpose of an election is not just to select a winner but to convince the loser and their supporters that they lost. Trust in the voting process is, therefore, an essential element to any voting system,” Dr. Vanessa Teague, a cryptographer and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia told CSO Online.    Copyright PUNCH.
