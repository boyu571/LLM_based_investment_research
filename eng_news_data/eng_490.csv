Bitcoin 21-Day MA Binary CDD Has Been Observing Downtrend Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there was some heavy distribution going on in the market just a while ago. The relevant indicator here is “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD). A coin day is the amount that 1 BTC accumulates after sitting still in a single address for 1 day. When a coin that was previously dormant (and was thus carrying some coin days) makes some movement on the chain, its coin days counter resets back to zero, and the coin days it had accumulated are said to be “destroyed.” The CDD metric measures the total amount of such coin days being destroyed across the network on any given day.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  When this indicator has a large value, it means long-term holders are possibly moving or selling their coins as this cohort tends to stack up huge numbers of coin days. “Binary CDD,” the version of the metric being used here, tells us whether the supply-adjusted CDD is more or less than the average supply-adjusted CDD.

The BTC price took a large hit while this trend was taking place. However, in the last couple of weeks or so, the indicator has been rapidly going down instead.

He will appear in Bahamian court Tuesday.The arrest and charges mark a major step in the investigations into Bankman-Fried and FTX. The founder and his company have been under intense scrutiny since November, when, over a period of several days he first sought a bailout from a competing exchange and then filed for bankruptcy after FTX was unable to honor customers’ withdrawal requests.Washington Post reporters Tory Newmyer, Julian Mark and Peter Whoriskey explain what led to the stunning collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. (Video: Joy Yi/The Washington Post, Photo: Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/The Washington Post)The company owes its creditors at least $3 billion, according to bankruptcy filings, and investigators have sought answers on whether it used customer funds to lend money to Bankman-Fried’s investment arm, Alameda Research.AdvertisementThe arrest came at the request of the U.S. government, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.”The SEC’s charges were expected after Bankman-Fried’s arrest, the agency said in a tweet Monday night.“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement when charges were announced. ""The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.Bankman-Fried was slated to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the committee, said in a statement the arrest will stop that from happening.Advertisement“The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity,” Waters said. “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many.”Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), a member of the House panel, tweeted Monday night that his committee was “ready to grill” Bankman-Fried “six ways to Sunday.” Zeldin still wanted that opportunity: “Why not allow him to 1st testify tomorrow and answer our many questions?” he wrote on Twitter.The Bahamas and the United States have an extradition treaty agreeing to hand over people who have been charged with crimes that are illegal in both countries, but it’s unclear how long it might be before Bankman-Fried is turned over to U.S. authorities.AdvertisementAt least one legal expert does not expect a long waiting period.Share this articleShare“The Bahamas may be a place people go to get shelter and try to avoid getting dragged back to their home country,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law. “But the Southern District of New York is the gold standard, and if they’re on this, I think it’s unlikely the Bahamas can get one past them for too long.”A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Spokespeople for the prime minister of the Bahamas, the attorney general of the Bahamas and the House Financial Services Committee did not respond to requests for comment.Bankman-Fried has spent the past few weeks in his Bahamas estate, giving numerous interviews to reporters and making dozens of social media posts trying to explain how his company went from being one of the biggest and most-respected crypto exchanges to filing for bankruptcy.AdvertisementBankman-Fried has said he made grave mistakes but has denied any malicious wrongdoing.“Look, I screwed up. I was the CEO of FTX. I say this again and again. That means I had a responsibility. We messed up big,” he said in a live-streamed interview with the New York Times last month. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers had discouraged him from appearing, he said.The chief executive brought in to handle the restructuring, John J. Ray, has described a chaotic environment at FTX with “a complete absence of trustworthy financial information.” In prepared remarks for the congressional testimony, Ray said his initial investigation of the company showed “gross mismanagement, excessive leverage” and “failures of internal controls.”The unraveling of FTX comes as the overall crypto market is floundering, and the situation has increased scrutiny of the entire industry.AdvertisementCrypto assets have lost huge amounts of their value over the past year, as the potential for a recession, higher interest rates and high-profile collapses of crypto companies prompt people to withdraw the money they invested during the crypto bull market.Bitcoin and ethereum, the two most popular crypto currencies, are both down around 65 percent for the year.Bankman-Fried’s arrest is made more pointed by his longtime reputation as a savior of troubled crypto companies. When firms began collapsing in the spring and early summer, FTX would often spring to their rescue, offering bailout money to companies like digital brokerage Voyager and crypto lender BlockFi. “We take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers,” Bankman-Fried tweeted at the time.Now, those companies are in trouble, too. Voyager wound up declaring bankruptcy in July but FTX won a bid to buy its assets for $1.4 billion several months later. In the wake of the FTX bankruptcy, that deal was called off. BlockFi filed for bankruptcy in late November after it no longer had access to the credit FTX had extended.AdvertisementBankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 as an exchange that made money by facilitating trades of cryptocurrencies and taking transaction fees. As the crypto boom unfolded and prices for bitcoin, ethereum and dozens of smaller tokens and coins exploded, the company grew to a valuation of $32 billion and received funding from major investors such as venture capital firm Sequoia and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.As Bankman-Fried, who owned the majority of FTX, saw his own net worth balloon, he amassed political influence as well. He was the second-largest Democratic donor in the 2022 midterm elections. Before FTX’s collapse, Bankman-Fried frequented Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to regulate the crypto industry. This put him at odds with other crypto industry leaders who oppose government intervention.He was also a major proponent of effective altruism and longtermism — philanthropic ideologies that emphasize efficiently using money to help others and considering the impact of philanthropic projects on the lives of future humans who aren’t born yet. He also poured millions into pandemic prevention initiatives.Many of the charities and organizations that had taken money from him were left in the cold after his company collapsed and his fortune evaporated.Tory Newmyer contributed to this report.Share CommentsLoading...",2022-12-13

He is now facing criminal charges in the United States, according to a Bahamian official. The Attorney General of the Bahamas, through spokesman Latrae Rahming, posted a statement on Twitter detailing the arrest. Bankman-Fried, commonly known as SBF, lives in the Bahamas, where the cryptocurrency exchange was also based.  “SBF’s arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against SBF and is likely to request his extradition,” the statement reads. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York later tweeted that his office had filed a sealed indictment, which led to the arrest. “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,” Damian Williams said in a tweet from the office’s official Twitter account. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are investigating the company, and the New York Times reported last week that Manhattan-based federal prosecutors are investigating whether Bankman-Fried steered prices of cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and Luna to benefit FTX and his Alameda hedge fund.  FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection in November, and Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO. In fact, more than 100 FTX-related entities filed for US bankruptcy protections on Nov. 11.  The former chief executive of FTX was expected to testify remotely in front of a House Financial Services Committee panel on Tuesday. He was called to appear before the criminal charges were announced. The new CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, is expected to testify in front of members of Congress on Tuesday, and in prepared remarks released Monday, he said that Bankman-Fried’s management of FTX was an “utter failure” that lacked any level of financial control. Lawmakers expressed some frustration that criminal charges would now take precedence. “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,” said Rep. Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, and chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, in a statement Monday night. “The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity,” she said, expressing her hope that Ray’s testimony will be crucial to the panel’s own investigation.   A copy of Bankman-Fried’s prepared remarks for the congressional panel was obtained by Bloomberg News, which tweeted some of the remarks, including a blunt consession from the former exec. “I would like to start by formally stating under oath: I f—-ked up,” Bankman-Fried reportedly said in the draft copy. SBF added that the company’s new leadership, led by Ray, has repeatedly rebuffed his offers to help sift through the wreckage of the crypto empire. Ray has not responded to five emails, he said, according to the report. MarketWatch’s Robert Schroeder contributed to this article.  ",2022-12-13

I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was,"" he told the BBC.He also denied allegations that he must have been aware that Alameda was using FTX customer funds.""No that's not true,"" Mr Bankman-Fried said, while going on to acknowledge that as chief executive he was ultimately responsible for any mishandling of funds. ""That's on me, one way or another,"" he said.The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.Cryptocurrencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities - often with a high degree of volatility.Their anonymity means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks, but their supporters say there is huge potential for innovation - and independence from governments.Mr Bankman-Fried was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett, and as recently as late October had a net worth estimated at more than $15bn.Before FTX's collapse he seemingly delighted in giving his Twitter followers an insight into his lifestyle, which involved playing League of Legends while on phone calls, even while attempting to woo investors, and sleeping on a beanbag next to his desk in the office.He had become well known in Washington DC as a political donor, mostly to Democratic politicians or groups, supposedly supporting pandemic prevention and improved crypto regulation.The fall of âKing of Cryptoâ Sam Bankman-FriedCrypto giant FTX collapses into bankruptcyMr Bankman-Fried will be held in custody ""pursuant of our nation's Extradition Act,"" the Attorney General of the Bahamas said in a statement.""Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY [Southern District of New York].

The arrest marks a stunning fall from grace for the 30-year-old entrepreneur widely known by his initials SBF, who rode a boom in bitcoin and other digital assets to become a billionaire many times over until FTX's rapid demise.  The exchange, launched in 2019 and based in the Bahamas, filed for bankruptcy Nov. 11 after it struggled to raise money to stave off collapse as traders rushed to withdraw $6 billion from the platform in just 72 hours. Since then it emerged Bankman-Fried secretly used $10 billion in customer funds to prop up his trading business.  The arrest came as Bankman-Fried prepared to lash out at his former lawyers at Sullivan and Cromwell, new FTX CEO John Ray and rival exchange operator Binance at a Congressional hearing. In the testimony, a draft copy of which was seen by Reuters, Bankman-Fried planned to say he was pressured by Sullivan and Cromwell lawyers to nominate Ray as CEO following the sudden exodus of customer funds. And when within minutes he changed his mind, following an offer of billions of dollars of fresh funding, he was told it was too late. Bankman-Fried will now be unable to testify, according to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), who said in a statement she was surprised to hear of his arrest. Ray's testimony will go ahead. Bankman-Fried was arrested shortly after 6:00 pm Monday (2300 GMT) at his apartment complex, a luxury gated community called the Albany, and will appear in a magistrate court on Tuesday, Bahamian police said. The Bahamas attorney general's office said it expects he will be extradited to the United States. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan confirmed Bankman-Fried had been arrested in the Bahamas but declined to comment on the charges.  U.S. prosecutors said they had a sealed indictment against Bankman-Fried and charges would be revealed on Tuesday. The New York Times reported he faces fraud and money laundering charges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately authorized charges relating to Bankman-Fried's violations of securities laws, the regulator said on Monday.  Bankman-Fried and his lawyer Mark Cohen did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did Sullivan and Cromwell, FTX, Ray and Binance.  Bankman-Fried has said he doesn't think he has any criminal liability. ""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said in a Nov. 30 interview at the New York Times' Dealbook Summit. CRYPTO INDUSTRY REELING FTX's demise sent shockwaves through an already-battered cryptocurrency industry, which has seen a string of meltdowns this year that have taken down other key players including Voyager Digital and Celsius Network. More trouble might be on the horizon for the industry. Reuters reported Monday that some Justice Department prosecutors believe they have gathered sufficient evidence in their long-running investigation of Binance to charge the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange and some top executives.  A Binance spokesperson told Reuters for the article: ""We don't have any insight into the inner workings of the U.S. Justice Department, nor would it be appropriate for us to comment if we did.""  Bitcoin was steady at $17,150. It is down more than 60% this year.  MEA CULPA  Since the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried has given numerous media interviews apologizing for his mistakes and explaining what happened at the company, something that legal experts said could allow prosecutors to point to inconsistencies to undermine his credibility with a jury.  ""The defense is going to be completely boxed in by the prior statements SBF has made and the very incisive questions he has answered in the press and on social media,” said criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. In his written testimony, Bankman-Fried repeated his mea culpa: ""I would like to start by formally stating, under oath: I fucked up,"" he wrote. Then, he launched into an explanation of how things went badly at FTX and his hedge fund Alameda Research, while criticizing Sullivan and Cromwell and Ray as well as arch rival Binance for their actions as his firm imploded.  UNDER PRESSURE  Describing his decision to give up his role as CEO of FTX and appoint Ray, Bankman-Fried said he was pressured to do so by Sullivan and Cromwell and the general counsel of FTX's U.S. unit, who he said was a former lawyer at the law firm.  Bankman-Fried said less than 10 minutes after he had signed a document at 4.30 am on Nov. 10 to make Ray the CEO of FTX, he received ""a potential funding offer for billions of dollars."" Bankman-Fried said he told his counsel to rescind the CEO appointment a few minutes later but was told it was already too late to do so.  Bankman-Fried said he had since been cut off from FTX's systems and Ray had not responded to his emails offering help or other information.  Bankman-Fried, who had become a prominent and unconventional figure known for his wild hair, t-shirts and shorts during crypto's boom, said the fortunes of FTX and his trading firm Alameda declined rapidly this year as crypto currencies crashed amid rising interest rates.   In late 2021, he said Alameda had net asset value of more than $50 billion and manageable levels of debt. That became unsustainable as digital assets declined. ""Last year, my net worth was valued at $20b,” Bankman-Fried wrote. “Last I saw, I believe my bank account had about $100k in it.”    ",2022-12-13

At one point, he was estimated to be worth $26 billion;  now he claims to have just $100,000 left.As chief executive of FTX, Bankman-Fried grew the cryptocurrency exchange he founded in 2019  into one of the largest in the world, with more than 1 million users at its peak last year. He was hailed as a positive force and trustworthy spokesperson for the emerging industry, especially as he rescued several failing crypto firms this year. Advertisement But FTX collapsed in spectacular fashion last month when users, worried about the exchange’s solvency, began pulling out their money en masse. That led to a catastrophic fiasco for FTX, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. At least $1 billion in customer funds has disappeared, according to estimates, and the collapse has triggered a surge in outflows across other global crypto exchanges.In a court filing submitted a few days later, its newly installed chief executive, John J. Ray III, a longtime insolvency expert, detailed the disastrous state of financial affairs at the once-heralded company.“I have been the Chief Restructuring Officer or Chief Executive Officer in several of the largest corporate failures in history,” Ray wrote in his declaration. “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.”      Business   Column: Crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried didn’t lose a $16-billion fortune. His ‘fortune’ was never real  Sam Bankman-Fried’s $16-billion fortune was always a myth. The mystery is why venture firms and the financial press thought it existed.Nov. 14, 2022FTX and Bankman-Fried are now facing investigations in the U.S. and the Bahamas, where the company is based, into a range of possible fraud.One key inquiry concerns whether customer funds were lent to trading firm Alameda Research, which Bankman-Fried also founded. Prosecutors are also examining whether hundreds of millions of dollars were improperly transferred to the Bahamas around the time of FTX’s bankruptcy filing.The arrest was made based on a sealed indictment, said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.“We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,” Williams said in a statement posted on Twitter.Shortly afterward, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it had authorized separate charges against Bankman-Fried “relating to his violations of securities laws, to be filed publicly tomorrow.”Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. But he declined to appear for a hearing with the Senate Banking Committee the day after, prompting lawmakers to condemn his “unprecedented abdication of accountability.” Advertisement Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said she was “surprised” to hear of Bankman-Fried’s arrest given his scheduled appearance the next day. “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,” Waters said in a statement. “The timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.” Bankman-Fried had been on a media blitz in recent weeks, doling out numerous interviews in an effort to explain what happened at FTX.Earlier on Monday, during an interview on Twitter Spaces, he said he was going to testify before the House remotely, instead of in person, on Tuesday because “the paparazzi effect is quite large.”“Are you worried you might be detained if you stepped foot into the U.S.?” one of the panelists responded.“I don’t believe I would be,” Bankman-Fried said.Bloomberg was used in compiling this report.

The Office of the Attorney General of the Bahamas issued a statement today, which was reported by BNO and other news outlets, that it would hold Bankman-Fried in custody until “a formal request for extradition is made.” In a statement, Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis said, “The Bahamas and the United States have a shared interest in holding accountable all individuals associated with FTX who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law. While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, The Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX, with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere.” The office the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams confirmed the arrest and the fact that it was made “at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY.” In a tweet, the office of the SDNY added: “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.” The former billionaire was scheduled to testify tomorrow as a witness before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, TechCrunch’s Jacquelyn Melinek reported earlier today. The committee is investigating the events that led up to FTX’s implosion, which resulted in the crypto exchange filing for bankruptcy last month and Bankman-Fried being forced to step down as chief executive. As TechCrunch previously reported, Reuters reported last month that Bankman-Fried secretly transferred $10 billion in FTX client funds to affiliated trading firm Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried told the publication that the transfer of the funds was a misreading of the “confusing internal labeling.” He has repeatedly claimed ignorance of any wrongdoing. Axios reported earlier today that Bankman-Fried “continued to decline to testify in front of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, and that his lawyers are refusing to accept a subpoena,” according to a new statement from Sens. Sherrod Brown and Pat Toomey. TechCrunch reporter Amanda Silberling contributed to this piece. TechCrunch’s weekly fintech newsletter, The Interchange, launched on May 1!

(Nansen)The outflow was the highest for Binance since Nov. 13, two days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, according to data provided by blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence.However, the outflow “doesn’t seem notably anomalous,” an Arkham analyst wrote in a Telegram chat, given that there are ostensibly $64 billions of assets on Binance.Withdrawals rose following a string of concerning news reports about Binance, and as investors have become increasingly cautious about their funds on centralized exchanges. The swift collapse of rival exchange FTX, piled on other industry debacles, has prompted other exchanges to prove that they are safeguarding customers’ assets.Criminal charges against Binance?Binance released a report by auditing firm Mazars last week claiming that its bitcoin (BTC) reserves are overcollateralized. Industry experts and recent reports flayed the document for its narrow scope, and on Monday, Reuters reported that U.S. prosecutors are mulling criminal charges for possible money laundering against Binance and its executives, including CEO Changpeng Zhao.Binance didn’t reply to a request for comment.

Ba… [+1141 chars]",Associated Press," NEW YORK (AP) — The former CEO of failed cryptocurrency firm FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been arrested in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. government, U.S. and Bahamian authorities said Monday.The arrest was made Monday after the U.S. filed criminal charges that are expected to be unsealed Tuesday, according to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. Bankman-Fried had been under criminal investigation by U.S. and Bahamian authorities following the collapse last month of FTX. The firm filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.“We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,” Williams said.   Bahamian Attorney General Ryan Pinder said the Bahamas would “promptly” extradite Bankman-Fried to the U.S. once the indictment is unsealed and U.S. authorities make a formal request. FTX is headquartered in the Bahamas and Bankman-Fried has largely remained in his Bahamian luxury compound in Nassau since the company’s failure. A spokesman for Bankman-Fried had no comment Monday evening. Bankman-Fried has a right to contest his extradition, which could delay but not likely stop his transfer to the U.S.       Bankman-Fried’s arrest comes just a day before he was due to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the committee, said she was “disappointed” that the American public, and FTX’s customers, would not get to see Bankman-Fried testify under oath. Bankman-Fried was one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper, with an estimated net worth of $32 billion. He was a prominent personality in Washington, donating millions of dollars toward mostly left-leaning political causes and Democratic political campaigns. FTX grew to become the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. That all unraveled quickly last month, when reports called into question the strength of FTX’s balance sheet. Customers moved to withdraw billions of dollars, but FTX could not meet all the requests because it apparently used its customers deposits to cover bad bets at Bankman-Fried’s investment arm, Alameda Research.  Bankman-Fried said recently that he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and said he believes his millions of angry customers will eventually be made whole. The House Financial Services Committee is still expected to hear testimony Tuesday from current CEO John Ray III. Ray, who took over FTX on Nov. 11 and is a long-time restructuring specialist, has said in court filings that the financial conditions at FTX were worse than at Enron. Bahamian authorities plan to continue their own investigation into Bankman-Fried.“The Bahamas and the United States have a shared interest in holding accountable all individuals associated with FTX who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law,” said Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis, in a statement. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it had authorized separate charges related to alleged violations of securities laws and would file them publicly Tuesday. ",2022-12-13

Now Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, the two executives at the center of the collapse of cryptocurrency firm FTX, appear to be turning on each other. After Bankman-Fried suggested she might be to blame for a missing $8 billion in customer money, Ellison could be signaling she’s willing to flip on her old boyfriend with the hiring of the law firm Wilmer Hale. Top white-collar attorneys point out that Wilmer Hale is among the most politically connected white-collar law firms in the country. It has a reputation for cutting deals with the Manhattan US Attorney’s Office, itself the country’s premier prosecutor of business-related crimes. “The scoop in white-collar defense circles is that Ellison is weighing whether to turn on (Bankman-Fried) and looking for a plea,” said one top attorney who has worked in law enforcement. “This firm is known to specialize in these deals.” Ellison’s hiring of Wilmer Hale comes as the Manhattan US Attorney’s Office has been scrambling to bring criminal charges against those responsible for what may be the biggest fraud in the industry’s history. In early November, the once-popular crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy as billions in customer funds held in supposedly secure accounts went missing. Ellison and SBF also face civil fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the more serious case comes from federal prosecutors; both Ellison and SBF could face years in jail if charged and convicted.   3  Caroline Ellison worked alongside Sam Bankman-Fried to create a massive cryptocurrency scam.Twitter / @carolinecapital   3  Bankman-Fried’s company lost $8 billion in customer money.FTX/Handout via REUTERS Prosecutors are investigating whether the FTX customer funds were misappropriated and used to make up losses in an affiliated prop-trading fund known as Alameda Research. Alameda is said to be 90% owned by Bankman-Fried, but Ellison was the crypto funds CEO at the time of the implosion. The two lived among a “cabal of roommates” at a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas, where they reportedly all dated each other. Ellison posted about her interest in BDSM sex and drug use, once saying that a “Chinese harem” was her preferred relationship status. The cratering of FTX and Alameda sent shockwaves throughout the $1 trillion crypto business, with prices of digital coins zig-zagging and Congress demanding heightened regulation. Billions of dollars in customer money remain missing from FTX as a bankruptcy trustee attempts to sort through the convoluted holdings of SBF.   3  Ellison hired Wilmer Hale, a premier law firm, to represent her.Twitter / @carolinecapital Bankman-Fried, meanwhile, has been on a media tour of late, telling selective news outlets that he still doesn’t show as much as $8 billion in customer funds have gone missing, but conceding that he didn’t have all the proper controls in place to prevent the disaster. The House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday will be holding the first of what will likely be many hearings on the FTX debacle. In recent weeks, SBF has stated he really didn’t spend much time on the trading of Alameda, suggesting to some white-collar lawyers he was looking to paint his former girlfriend as the culprit for its demise and the missing customer money.  But Ellison appears to be making moves that show she could turn the tables on Bankman-Fried, who was once worth close to $20 billion and built a cult following among members of the media and celebrities for his charitable giving and unorthodox, often shambolic appearance.

Bankman-Fried was arrested based on a sealed indictment filed by the Southern District Court of New York, the court said in a statement citing U.S. attorney Damian Williams. The indictment will likely be unsealed on Tuesday morning, Williams said.  Separately, the Office of the Attorney General of the Bahamas said that Bankman-Fried faces potential extradition to the U.S. The former FTX CEO’s arrest comes just ahead of a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, where Bankman-Fried was expected to testify remotely. He had also reportedly refused to testify at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday over the FTX collapse. FTX, once the second-largest crypto exchange in the world, filed for bankruptcy in November after reports that it had misappropriated customer funds triggered a slew of withdrawals which it could not honor.  FTX had allegedly spent and traded customer funds through Bankman-Fried’s trading firm Alameda Research.  In a series of interviews after the bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried had attempted to downplay accusations of fraud, instead attributing the alleged misappropriation of customer funds to poor capital controls and accounting errors. He had resigned as FTX’s CEO on the same day as the bankruptcy filing. The exchange and its U.S. subsidiary had both suspended withdrawals in November, with no indication of when customers will be able to withdraw their funds. Reports suggest that at least $1 billion worth of customer funds are unaccounted for.  The exchange’s bankruptcy sent ripples through the crypto market, coming as a major blow to the space after a sustained decline in prices this year. It also triggered bankruptcies in several companies that were exposed to FTX, including lenders BlockFi and Voyager Digital. The crypto market has lost over two-thirds of its market capitalization in the past year, as rising interest rates and growing scrutiny of the space triggered a sharp drop in token prices. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is trading down over 75% from a record high hit in November 2021.  ",2022-12-13

Bankman-Fried was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday with defrauding investors in what regulators called ""a house of cards,"" hours before he was set to appear before a magistrate in the Bahamas.  The fallen crypto entrepreneur was arrested by Bahamian authorities late on Monday at the request of the U.S. government, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. The Bahamian attorney general said in a separate statement the United States was likely to request his extradition. Bankman-Fried amassed billions of dollars in personal wealth running FTX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges that was valued earlier this year at $32 billion.  Since stepping down, Bankman-Fried has said he no longer has a role at the company. Yet he also told a Vox reporter he believed FTX's bankruptcy filing was a mistake and has suggested on Twitter and in media interviews that he can still raise liquidity to repay customers. He did not specify how he planned to do so.  FTX appointed restructuring expert John Ray as CEO after Bankman-Fried stepped down on Nov. 11, shortly before filing for bankruptcy. Ray oversaw the liquidation of Enron, the energy trading giant that collapsed in scandal and bankruptcy in 2001.  WILD HAIR, T-SHIRTS, CELEBRITY PALS Known in financial circles by his initials, SBF, Bankman-Fried had become a prominent and unconventional figure known for his wild hair, t-shirts and shorts. He appeared on panels with celebrity politicians such as former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as well as with supermodel Gisele Bundchen.  Bankman-Fried contributed $5.2 million to President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign and became one of the largest donors to Democratic political candidates.  ""Nobody was saying that anything was wrong with SBF,"" said Marius Ciubotariu, co-founder of the Hubble protocol, a decentralized lending platform.  The collapse of FTX caught markets by surprise because Bankman-Fried was seen as a business-savvy founder adept at striking deals, he said. The one-time crypto wunderkind was raised in California by two Stanford University law professors, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried. Bankman-Fried started his career at Jane Street Capital, a choice he has said was influenced by a desire to make money to pursue his interest in effective altruism, a movement that encourages people to prioritize donations to charities.  FROM BILLIONS TO BANKRUPTCY Taking advantage of the price differences in bitcoin in Asia and the United States, SBF amassed a fortune that Forbes estimated a year ago was as high as $26.5 billion. He eventually started crypto trading firm Alameda Research in 2017 and founded FTX a year later. It was valued in January at $32 billion. Reuters has reported that over the past two years, FTX, Bankman-Fried's parents and FTX senior executives bought at least 19 properties worth nearly $121 million in the Bahamas, where FTX is based.  Since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has distanced himself from the image he projected in media interviews and on Capitol Hill, telling the Vox reporter his advocacy for a crypto regulatory framework was ""just PR"" and his discussions on ethics within the industry were at least partly a front.  As traders rushed to withdraw funds from FTX in the days before the company collapsed, Bankman-Fried told investors he was convinced the business would be rescued, according to a source familiar with the situation.  FTX's meltdown sent bitcoin plunging to a two-year low as investors worried the company's problems would spread to other crypto firms. Employees were blindsided; some sent apologetic notes to clients expressing shock at what had happened, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bankman-Fried himself has apologized multiple times to customers and employees.   For all his recent celebrity endorsements, notoriety and big-name backers, Bankman-Fried said he was not always confident about FTX's prospects. ""I thought we would fail,"" Bankman-Fried said at a June conference weeks before FTX and Alameda extended lifelines to two struggling crypto platforms.

Frank American tech insiders (aka “Silicon Valley parents”) have been limiting their own children’s use and exposure to technology for years.  They send their kids to low-tech and no-tech schools, make their nannies sign “no screens” contracts, and spy on their nannies to make sure they aren’t breaking those contracts (see 1, 2, 3, 4).  Of course, research continues to prove that kids’ use of smartphones and other digital devices isn’t good for their behavioral, emotional, mental, and physical health (see 1, 2, 3).  It’s combination of harmful things – exposure to blue light (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), exposure to cell phone radiation as well as other sources of wireless “Wi-Fi” radiation and electromagnetic fields (EMF), and exposure to addictive and/or inappropriate content.  Kids are not exempt from ruthless data collection practices either.  For parents with little ones, here’s another reminder about why you may want to keep devices away from them. From Study Finds:       Using smartphones to calm young children can stifle emotional development by Study Finds ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Using smartphones and other digital devices to pacify young children can backfire and end up stifling their emotional development, a new study warns. Researchers at Michigan Medicine say digital technology may help calm down toddlers in the short term, but it could also reduce their chances to practice emotional coping skills. Scientists add that handing a moody pre-school age child a screen may seem to offer a quick fix, yet it could also lead to more severe challenging behavior further down the line. The findings of the study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, show that frequent use of smartphones and tablets to calm upset children between three and five years-old led to increased emotional dysregulation in kids, particularly in boys. “Using mobile devices to settle down a young child may seem like a harmless, temporary tool to reduce stress in the household, but there may be long term consequences if it’s a regular go-to soothing strategy,” says lead author Jenny Radesky, M.D., a developmental behavioral pediatrician at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, in a media release. “Particularly in early childhood, devices may displace opportunities for development of independent and alternative methods to self-regulate.” This could backfire among boys and those with ADHD The study involved 422 parents and 422 three to five-year-old children. The research team analyzed parent and caregiver responses to how often they used devices as a calming tool and associations to symptoms of emotional reactivity or dysregulation over a six-month period. Signs of increased dysregulation could include rapid shifts between sadness and excitement, a sudden change in mood or feelings and heightened impulsivity. The findings suggest that the association between device-calming and emotional consequences was particularly high among boys and children who may already experience hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and a strong temperament that makes them more likely to react intensely to feelings such as anger, frustration, and sadness. “Our findings suggest that using devices as a way to appease agitated children may especially be problematic to those who already struggle with emotional coping skills,” Radesky says. She says that the preschool period is a stage when children may be more likely to exhibit difficult behavior, such as tantrums, defiance, and intense emotions. That may make it even more tempting to use devices as a parenting tool. “Caregivers may experience immediate relief from using devices if they quickly and effectively reduce children’s negative and challenging behaviors,” the researcher continues. “This feels rewarding to both parents and children and can motivate them both to maintain this cycle.” “The habit of using devices to manage difficult behavior strengthens over time as children’s media demands strengthen as well. The more often devices are used, the less practice children – and their parents – get to use other coping strategies.” Screen time can be useful in moderation Radesky acknowledged that there are times when parents may strategically use devices to distract children, such as during travel or multitasking with work. While occasional use of digital devices to occupy children is expected and realistic, Dr. Radesky notes it is important for it not to become a primary or regular soothing tool.     She adds that pediatric health professionals should also initiate conversations with parents and caregivers about using devices with young children and encourage alternative methods for emotional regulation. “In contrast, using a distractor like a mobile device doesn’t teach a skill – it just distracts the child away from how they are feeling. Kids who don’t build these skills in early childhood are more likely to struggle when stressed out in school or with peers as they get older,” Dr. Radesky concludes.

A Coindesk report on Nov. 2 noted that Alameda held a large swath of funds in FTT, FTX’s own cryptocurrency, triggering a run on the ersatz bank. By Nov. 10, FTX halted customer withdrawals; it sought bankruptcy protection the next day.AdvertisementDamian Williams, the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, confirmed that he filed sealed charges against Bankman-Fried on Monday, Dec. 12, and said the indictment will be unsealed in the morning.Bahamian authorities confirmed SBF’s arrestWilliams’ announcement was preceded by a notice from the Bahamian authorities confirming the arrest:“The Bahamas and the United States have a shared interest in holding accountable all individuals associated with FTX who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law. While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, The Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX, with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere”AdvertisementAfter FTX filed for Chapter 11 protection, new CEO John Ray III bashed the company’s mismanagement in a court filing. “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” wrote Ray, who led Enron through its bankruptcy proceedings.Bankman-Fried had been scheduled to testify before the US House of Representatives on Tuesday, Dec. 13.The US House Committee on Financial Services chairwoman Maxine Waters, who was tasked with organizing the hearing, reacted to the news in a press statement: “The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity. While I am disappointed that we will not be able to hear from Mr. Bankman-Fried tomorrow, we remain committed to getting to the bottom of what happened, and the Committee looks forward to beginning our investigation by hearing from Mr. John Ray III tomorrow.”This story was updated with a comment from congresswoman Maxine Waters.",2022-12-13

FTX's current CEO, John Ray III, will still testify before the Committee.Since FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on November 11, Bankman-Fried’s public statements have painted his involvement in the crypto exchange's demise as mismanagement or negligence.""I don’t have the answer in front of me. I wasn’t involved much in this process,"" he said during a Monday interview over Twitter when faced with a string of questions about how FTX valued customer collateral positions.Bankman-Fried has also made numerous media appearances and continued to tweet regularly about FTX since being ousted from his position with the company last month. In his highest-profile media appearance since FTX's collapse last month, Bankman-Fried told The New York Times his public comments were being made against the advice of his legal counsel.In prepared testimony published ahead of Tuesday's hearing, Ray outlined several ""unacceptable management practices"" the new CEO has uncovered so far at the bankrupt crypto exchange.Ray, who led the liquidation of Enron, also verified at least five ways FTX had been spending its money, including commingling customer assets with its trading arm, Alameda Research. When FTX filed for bankruptcy, the company reported an $8 billion asset hole.As Yahoo Finance reported, knowledge, or lack thereof, as to how the crypto platform handled its customers’ funds — as well as other funds — will ultimately determine whether Bankman-Fried, or other decision makers from the now bankrupt firm, will face civil claims or criminal accusations tied to the collapseDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance covering the cryptocurrency and stock markets.

… [+2742 chars]",Associated Press," NEW YORK (AP) — The former CEO of failed cryptocurrency firm FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been arrested in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. government, U.S. and Bahamian authorities said Monday.The arrest was made Monday after the U.S. filed criminal charges that are expected to be unsealed Tuesday, according to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. Bankman-Fried had been under criminal investigation by U.S. and Bahamian authorities following the collapse last month of FTX. The firm filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.“We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,” Williams said.   Bahamian Attorney General Ryan Pinder said the Bahamas would “promptly” extradite Bankman-Fried to the U.S. once the indictment is unsealed and U.S. authorities make a formal request. FTX is headquartered in the Bahamas and Bankman-Fried has largely remained in his Bahamian luxury compound in Nassau since the company’s failure. A spokesman for Bankman-Fried had no comment Monday evening. Bankman-Fried has a right to contest his extradition, which could delay but not likely stop his transfer to the U.S.       Bankman-Fried’s arrest comes just a day before he was due to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the committee, said she was “disappointed” that the American public, and FTX’s customers, would not get to see Bankman-Fried testify under oath. Bankman-Fried was one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper, with an estimated net worth of $32 billion. He was a prominent personality in Washington, donating millions of dollars toward mostly left-leaning political causes and Democratic political campaigns. FTX grew to become the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. That all unraveled quickly last month, when reports called into question the strength of FTX’s balance sheet. Customers moved to withdraw billions of dollars, but FTX could not meet all the requests because it apparently used its customers deposits to cover bad bets at Bankman-Fried’s investment arm, Alameda Research.  Bankman-Fried said recently that he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and said he believes his millions of angry customers will eventually be made whole. The House Financial Services Committee is still expected to hear testimony Tuesday from current CEO John Ray III. Ray, who took over FTX on Nov. 11 and is a long-time restructuring specialist, has said in court filings that the financial conditions at FTX were worse than at Enron. Bahamian authorities plan to continue their own investigation into Bankman-Fried.“The Bahamas and the United States have a shared interest in holding accountable all individuals associated with FTX who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law,” said Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis, in a statement. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it had authorized separate charges related to alleged violations of securities laws and would file them publicly Tuesday. ",2022-12-13

The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York confirmed Bankman-Fried’s arrest but declined to comment on the nature of the charges. “Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York,” prosecutor Damian Williams said in a statement. “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.” The charges against Bankman-Fried, who was once ranked as the world’s second-richest millennial after Mark Zuckerberg, include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering, the New York Times reported, citing an unnamed source with knowledge of the matter. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is responsible for civil enforcement and administrative actions, said it separately authorised charges related to Bankman-Fried’s alleged violations of securities laws. In a statement, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said his country and the US had a “shared interest” in holding accountable anyone who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law. “While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, The Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX, with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere,” Davis said. Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, Mark Cohen, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bankman-Fried’s arrest came just hours after he said he would on Tuesday testify remotely about the collapse of FTX before the US Congress. FTX, founded in 2019 and based in the Bahamas, filed for bankruptcy protection last month after the collapse of an acquisition deal involving rival exchange Binance. The collapse of the crypto exchange, valued at $32bn at its peak, sent shockwaves through the crypto sector, triggering mass layoffs, accusations of fraud and questions about the future of digital currencies as a whole. Among other allegations of wrongdoing, FTX has been accused of using billions of dollars in customer funds to prop up Alameda, a trading company controlled by Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried has admitted making a “lot of mistakes” in his handling of the collapse but denied any intention to commit fraud. ",2022-12-13

The attorney general's office for The Bahamas said it proceeded with the arrest after receiving formal confirmation of charges against Bankman-Fried, adding that it expects he will be extradited to the United States. A spokesman for the US Attorney's office in Manhattan confirmed Bankman-Fried had been arrested in The Bahamas but declined to comment on what the charges were. “Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York,"" United States prosecutor Damian Williams said in a statement. ""We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time."" Mark Cohen, a lawyer for Bankman-Fried, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. FTX, which had been among the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11 in one of the highest-profile crypto blowups after traders pulled $6 billion from the platform in three days and rival exchange Binance abandoned a rescue deal. The liquidity crunch came after Bankman-Fried secretly moved $10 billion of FTX customer funds to Alameda, Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. At least $1 billion in customer funds had vanished, the people said. Bankman-Fried told Reuters the company did not ""secretly transfer"" but rather misread its ""confusing internal labeling."" Asked about the missing funds, he responded: ""???"" In a series of interviews and public appearances in late November and December, Bankman-Fried acknowledged risk management failures but sought to distance himself from accusations of fraud, saying he never knowingly commingled customer funds on FTX with funds at his proprietary trading firm, Alameda Research. ""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said in a Nov. 30 interview at the New York Times' Dealbook Summit, adding he doesn't personally think he has any criminal liability. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX's chief executive officer the same day as the bankruptcy filing. The US Attorney's Office in Manhattan, led by veteran securities fraud prosecutor Williams, in mid-November began investigating how FTX handled customer funds, a source with knowledge of the probe told Reuters. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission also opened probes. US crypto investors also sued Bankman-Fried, alleging he and a slew of celebrities who promoted FTX engaged in deceptive practices, leaving the investors with $11 billion in damages. FTX's demise marked the latest turmoil for the cryptocurrency industry this year. The overall crypto market has slumped amid a string of meltdowns that have taken down other key players including Voyager Digital and Celsius Network. ",2022-12-13

Read Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction 2023-24  Over the next week, the idea of another drop was supported by the price action as well as the technical indicators. If Bitcoin also sees weakness in the next few days, fear could grip the market and Dogecoin can reach the lows from November.      Dogecoin presents the possibility of a bearish move, traders can wait for the trigger to enter positions Source: DOGE/USDT on TradingView The red box at $0.089 highlighted a bullish order block formed on 26 November. It was tested on 28 November and saw a sharp bullish reaction from DOGE. The price rallied to $0.11, a move that measured nearly 22%. The past couple of days of trading saw Dogecoin slip beneath the $0.094 support level, and test the order block again. However, the candlewick to $0.085 in recent hours was not an encouraging sign. It indicated that bulls might have lost the battle. In the next day or two, a move below $0.0888, followed by a retest of the $0.089 area can offer a selling opportunity. The previously bullish order block would have flipped to become a bearish breaker. Sellers can take profit at $0.083 and $0.073. Meanwhile, invalidation of this bearish notion would be a move back above $0.09. This trade was relatively low risk. The Relative Strength Index (RSI)’s drop below neutral 50 recently showed that a move downward was a likelihood. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) also gradually declined over the past week.   Source: Santiment The dormant circulation metric saw sharp spikes on 10 November and 21 July. Both times, the spike was chronologically close to a large price move on Dogecoin. However, since the November spike, another was yet to appear, even though DOGE noted large losses in recent days. The 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) was a more reliable indicator of local tops in recent months. Its ascent past the 10% mark occurred thrice since July and was followed by a steep plunge in prices all three times. At press time the MVRV was back in negative territory, but this might not be indicative of the end of a near-term downtrend. A retest of the bearish breaker, if it occurs, can be a trigger for short sellers. News in the wider economic sphere and global indices can also have an impact on the performance of the crypto market over the next two weeks.

The gang's operations were still ongoing despite the strict crackdown of Beijing regarding crypto trading in the country back in 2021, with the gang finally caught by authorities now. Authorities claimed that these gang members were engaged in illegal activities as their main source of funds, one that they tried to launder via cryptocurrency. Chinese Gang Laundered $1.7B to Cryptocurrency, Caught by Police   (Photo : Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Illustrative image of two commemorative bitcoins seen in front of a mural representing the coronavirus molecules. On Sunday, 27 June 2021, in Dublin, Ireland.   The Public Security Bureau of Inner Mongolia's Tongliao City said in a statement that it seized 63 gang members involved in laundering money via cryptocurrency, as part of the group's illicit earnings. According to the officials, the gang started its money laundering activities and was able to process 12 billion Chinese yuan into $1.7 billion Tether in crypto.  It is known that the USDT, a.k.a. Tether, has a 1:1 ratio in US dollars to the cryptocurrency coin. This proved to be a significant way for the gang to transfer and move its money, which they have been doing since May 2021. According to CNBC, the gang was able to generate this massive amount via criminal behavior and actions including pyramid schemes, fraud, and gambling.

It is still a massive crime to trade cryptocurrency in China, and the country has massive regulations against its crypto mining and trading in the country. China's Massive Crypto Ban China's cryptocurrency ban in the country is extensive, and it disapproves of the new digital currencies that the rest of the world is trying to accept and welcome to their countries. Back in early 2021, there was news regarding many Chinese citizens trying to make their way to Texas to continue their livelihood in the state that is more accepting of cryptocurrency. The massive ban in China for cryptocurrency affected a significant part of its citizen's jobs, especially as the world's crypto mining sees a notable operation in the Chinese region.  One of the massive effects of China's extensive cryptocurrency ban is the market crash earlier this year, and it caused top coins to plummet due to its people no longer having permission to mine the coins. Coins including Ethereum, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and US Tether saw a massive crash on different platforms that greatly affected them in the long run.  With China's crypto ban for the country, anyone seen touching, trading, and mining digital currency will immediately brand as criminals and face prosecution.

Liquidators in the island nation have asked a US judge for access to FTX data controlled by their American counterparts.“It is a request for live, dynamic access that would be provided immediately to the government of the Bahamas and to Messrs. Samuel Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, who are located in the Bahamas and working closely with Bahamian officials,” American lawyers wrote in a court filing Tuesday. Wang is an FTX co-founder.Bankman-Fried and Wang didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday in the Bahamas after the US filed criminal charges against him.

Bankman-Fried gave up control of FTX to restructuring expert John J. Ray III and a team of lawyers and financial advisers who are poring over the company’s books in search of cash, cryptocurrency and assets that could be sold to help repay creditors.Days after FTX put about 100 units into bankruptcy in Wilmington, Delaware, the company’s American restructuring team accused the Bahamian government of meddling in the US reorganization effort. Bahamas officials are “responsible for directing unauthorized access” to FTX systems in order to get control of digital assets under the supervision of a US court, American lawyers said in a court filing, citing social media posts and text messages from Bankman-Fried and others.While Ray and his team tried to get control of FTX’s computer systems, they watched as someone minted new coins. Eventually, they concluded it was Bankman-Fried and Wang working at the behest of the Bahamas.Liquidation FightThe FTX lawyers also complained about legal maneuvers by Bahamas liquidators to expand the scope of their authority beyond the single FTX unit currently being liquidated by a Bahamian court. The liquidators have asked the US judge to force their American counterparts to give Bahamian lawyers access to trading platform data, email records and other information stored on FTX systems.A lawyer for the Bahamas liquidator did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The two sides will also square off in federal court in January over how much deference the US team must give to the case in the Bahamas.In US bankruptcy courts, creditors are repaid based on the priority of their debt, not their nationality. When multinational corporations file bankruptcy in the US, a federal judge usually has authority to distribute all of the company’s assets, once a final reorganization plan is approved. Sometimes, a company’s assets are so closely tied to debt owed to foreign creditors, that additional insolvency cases are filed outside the US.When that happens, international legal fights can drag on for years, delaying payment to creditors.The case is FTX Trading Ltd., 22-11068, US. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. ",2022-12-13

The 30-year-old had in recent weeks defied legal advice and multiplied media appearances offering his version of his company's sudden failure, usually by video link from the Bahamas where his company is headquartered. ""Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the southern district of New York,"" said a tweeted statement from Damian Williams, lead prosecutor for the district.

The report exposed that Alameda's balance sheet was heavily built on the FTT currency -- a token created by FTX and with no independent value. The price of FTT plunged in early November, roiling both Alameda and FTX, where Alameda had large trading positions. Reeling from customer withdrawals and short some $8 billion, FTX and some 100 related entities filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov 11, inviting scrutiny from regulators, prosecutors and furious clients who had believed the hype about cryptocurrency.

In addition, a 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS) was made applicable on transfer of such assets.Crypto investor Priya Ratnam believes that a lot of people investing in crypto are already in the highest income-tax bracket of 30 percent. “The TDS is a concern for frequent traders, like intra-day and short-term traders. If you transact more than 10-15 times, it freezes up quite a bit of capital,” says Ratnam, CEO, Avisa Games Guild, a Web3 gaming guild.Unaware investorThanks to the breakneck rally in crypto assets millions of Indians have poured billions into these digital assets. Data with CoinGecko, a digital currency price and data platform, showed that bitcoin has delivered a return of 24,980 percent since 2013, while ether is up 2,89,801 percent since 2015. Related stories Bitcoin jumps over $30,000 for first time since AugustBitcoin pares after BlackRock says ETF application under reviewFalse declarations to avoid steep TCS could lead to penalties, warn experts Not just metros, tier-I and tier-II cities have contributed substantially to the demand for crypto assets. KoinX, a platform that helps calculate and provide crypto tax reports, has around 60 percent of its customers from tier-II cities such as Patna, Bhubaneshwar, Ranchi, Jaipur, and Mohali.However, experts flag that even after eight months of the implementation of crypto taxation, not many are aware of the rules.“A lot of people still believe that when they convert their crypto and withdraw it into their bank account, only then are taxes applicable,” said Punit Agarwal, Founder, KoinX.Taxation gapsGovernment rules state that events such as crypto transfer or withdrawal from one’s wallet and putting it in that of another are taxable. Further, it is the buyer’s responsibility to report capital gains arising out of crypto assets. Also, rules mandate that the buyer of a VDA to ensure that tax is deducted at source at 1 percent of sale consideration.To make life simpler for users, Indian crypto exchanges deduct TDS by default on every trade on their platform, but the international ones do not.“People assume that trades on international exchanges do not attract TDS. However, there is no clear position articulated by the government about TDS or taxation if a person is trading on an international exchange,” said Agarwal.Navigating complexitiesThen there’s the issue of computing and calculating the quantum of taxes. Experts warn that since gains in one crypto asset cannot be offset against losses in another, investors should keep in mind that they have to pay taxes at the rate of 30 percent on every instance of capital gains.Indy Sarker, co-founder of TaxCryp, said, “There are lots of complexities around tax calculation. A sizeable crypto investor’s chartered accountant might not be equipped to deal with hundreds and thousands of transactions. There are CAs who ask for all your bank statements, and that’s way more information than they need.”Sarker shared that in some instances investors have received a quote for up to Rs 1 lakh from CAs to file someone’s crypto taxes.Tax experts feel that there is not much clarity in terms of how different types of crypto transactions are to be treated.“ITR forms have three sections for income from VDAs. One is under `capital gains’, one is under `business income’, and the third is under `special income.’ Which transaction is to be classified under what category is something that needs clarity,” said Agarwal.For example, there’s not much clarity in how crypto airdrops would be treated. Airdrops involve sending tokens to the wallets of individuals, either for free or in exchange for a small promotional service.“Say, I got one crypto token, which has a price of Rs 1 lakh. If I sell it for Rs 1.5 lakh, will the additional Rs 50,000 or the entire Rs 1.5 lakh be treated as capital gains? Would it be considered special income? Clarity on these classifications is expected, along with clarifications around the GST aspect of things,” added Agarwal.NRI factorThere’s also ambiguity over the chargeability of VDAs.Indian taxation is based on the principle of the residence of the person and the source of income. Worldwide income of Indian residents is taxable in India. Non-residents, however, are subject to source-based taxation, meaning only amounts received or accrued, or deemed to accrue or arise in India are subject to income tax in India.“Currently, the Income Tax Act does not contain any provision to identify the situs of VDAs. VDAs being intangible property, the judicial pronouncements on the situs of an intangible property may be referred to determine the situs of VDAs,” said Naveen Wadhwa, Deputy General Manager at Taxmann.For legal jurisdiction or taxation purposes, situs means the place to which a property belongs.For example, there is not much clarity on how gains from crypto will be taxed if an Indian investor becomes a non-resident Indian (NRI).Given the lack of clarity over many aspects of crypto taxation, experts suggest that investors would be better off in taking a CA or tax portal’s help in filing their taxes for this year. They also suggest that investors keep a record of all trade reports and each transaction of the past five-seven years in case a tax scrutiny arises. ",2022-12-13

According to their discovery, the so-called ""COVID-Bit"" cyberattack can access air-gapped computer security systems and have access even to the most sensitive of networks in the world. The cybersecurity researchers demonstrated how this system could access even the top-rated secured networks in the world with only a USB flash drive, electromagnetic radiation, and a cheap antenna.  COVID-Bit Cyberattack Can Access Air-Gapped, Sensitive Networks  (Photo : Patrick Lux/Getty Images)  A study published in the preprint website, arXiv, by Ben-Gurion University researchers discovered a new and sophisticated way that threat actors may use to access sensitive, air-gapped systems in the industry. The researchers dubbed this attack ""COVID-Bit,"" and it needs to have a person stick a physical USB flash drive to a computer system for this to work. While this is a hard thing to do, especially as one needs either to blackmail an employee or retrieve and return their flash drives with the malware already installed, there are ways to make it happen.  After which, the malware will access the computer's CPU cores, which in turn, could generate low-frequency electromagnetic radiation.

Electromagnetic radiation can help in transferring files to the intended destinations, already containing sensitive information, passwords, bitcoin wallets, and more.  Cybersecurity and its Help in Preventing Hacks Cybersecurity is a massive problem in the current technological infrastructure now, especially as the world has already transitioned into a more tech-inclined society with a massive reliance on gadgets and the internet. People are in danger on almost every aspect of the internet, from bot malware that tries to access one's computer, to targeted attacks to steal data and information.  With these, many cybersecurity experts study and learn more about the current trends in the technology industry to keep up with it and help avoid future problems and access. In Ukraine's case, investing in cybersecurity played well for the country, especially in this time of modern warfare, and one of the used ways to get ahead of the opposing force is via their networks or computers. Good thing is that Ukrainians are ready for any attacks that the Russians throw against them, with the latter known for their computer hacking skills. Studies like what Ben-Gurion University recently discovered are a massive help to those who opt for air-gapped security systems for their computers. Despite having no fix for this problem, the cybersecurity researchers helped in making it known to those who use the same systems, as preventive measures are better than attempting to fix it after access.  Related Article: Cuba Ransomware Gang Steals Over $60 Million From Ransom Victims                        ⓒ 2023 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Shielded from a cold November night, partygoers indulged in an open bar lit up by the blue, green and red strobe lights pulsing through the makeshift club. Following performances by Beck, Chris Rock and Aziz Ansari, the main event of the evening was a set by The Strokes. Wylie Aronow was swaying with his girlfriend as they listened to the acclaimed New York rock band. She turned to him and uttered three surreal words: ""You did this."" Just a year prior, Aronow was living ""bed to bathroom"" with colitis, a disease that can cause chronic inflammation along the digestive tract. The illness forced him to drop out of college and caused him to languish for much of his 20s. Now Aronow is better known as Gordon Goner, one of the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT phenomenon.Along with the three other founders -- Gargamel (Greg Solano), Emperor Tomato Ketchup (Kerem Atalay) and No Sass (Zeshan Ali) -- he'd organized the show everyone was watching. They'd also gotten help from Guy Oseary, the famed manager of Madonna and U2, who signed a deal to represent BAYC the month prior. It was Nov. 4, 2021. The Bored Ape Yacht Club was scarcely seven months old. The concert concluded the final day of Ape Fest, a string of activities taking place in New York, tailored for holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which are crypto tokens that prove ownership of a digital item. Earlier events included a yacht party and an art gallery featuring NFTs from the collection. For many, that week signaled the Bored Ape Yacht Club's transformation from an online curiosity to a tangible subculture. ""It's only in those moments of taking a break that you see how much your life has changed,"" Aronow said in an interview. ""It just hit me so hard.""            Enlarge Image                Bored Ape Yacht Club founders Zeshan Ali (red Hawaiian shirt), Kerem Atalay (green hoodie), Wylie Aronow (charcoal T-shirt, red shirt) and Greg Solano (black hoodie). Yuga Lab's CEO, Nicole Muniz, is in the center.  Yuga LabsThe Bored Ape Yacht Club has grown bigger than anyone could have possibly predicted. Aronow says he initially envisioned BAYC as a Web3 version of the streetwear brand Supreme. It's grown into something drastically more ambitious, mixing apparel, live events and an upcoming video game. Yuga Labs, the company the four founders formed to launch the Bored Ape Yacht Club, now has over 100 employees, and is valued at $4 billion.Blockchain technologies like crypto and NFTs form the basis of Web3, the supposed next generation of the internet that seeks to take control of the internet away from major platforms like Amazon, Meta and Google. But detractors say that Web3 and all of its components, NFTs and crypto chief among them, are merely Ponzi schemes, that the battered valuations of bitcoin and ether represent years of hype finally making contact with reality.In an area where scams and fraudsters are ubiquitous — see the recent collapse of the FTX exchange and its disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried — Yuga Labs aims to prove that Web3 can not only be legitimate, but is in fact the future.""There's a Satoshi Nakamoto quote, 'If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you,'"" said Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano, aka Gargamel, referencing bitcoin's pseudonymous founder. ""I think that's the wrong attitude. I understand that people don't understand it. We want to build the roads, the infrastructure, that makes this inherently fun."" In the past 20 months, the Bored Ape Yacht Club has become the poster child of NFTs. Though far from their all-time high, the cheapest BAYC NFT on sale costs around $88,000, making it a hard club for newcomers to easily join. Even Yuga's secondary NFT collection designed to be more accessible, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, has a base price of just under $19,000. To create a more achievable entry point, Yuga Labs is looking to the metaverse, building a crypto-integrated game it hopes will help usher in the next generation of Web3 adopters.It won't be easy.  The Bored Ape and the bear marketIt's a bad time to be in crypto right now. Really bad. 2022 saw bitcoin and ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, plunge precipitously from their November 2021 all-time highs. Ether, the cryptocurrency on which much of the NFT world relies, is down more than 70% from its peak.The pain inflicted by the so-called crypto winter is felt far beyond the blood-red color that dominates year-over-year price graphs. The implosion of the Terra stablecoin in May wiped billions from the market, causing some ordinary people to lose extraordinary amounts of money. Things have only gotten worse since then.November saw the bankruptcy of FTX, a crypto exchange once worth over $26 billion which earlier this year participated in Yuga Labs' latest funding round. The job of an exchange like FTX is to buy and hold cryptocurrencies ordered by its customers. How that mandate resulted in $8 billion of debt exemplifies many of the worst parts about cryptocurrency: limited accountability taken advantage of by shady founders, leading to spectacular crashes. In October, Bankman-Fried, better known as SBF, was one of crypto's most trusted faces. His fall from grace has inflicted enormous harm on crypto's already beleaguered reputation. Calls for regulation have been amplified, most notably by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who warned that an unfettered crypto industry could tank the economy.""There's extraordinary regulatory scrutiny right now, and it's only going to get worse,"" said John Reed Stark, former chief of the Office of Internet Enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission and current president of John Reed Stark Consulting. ""I don't think any company that I've ever seen [in crypto] has the maturity or the wherewithal to be capable of handling that kind of regulation.""Yuga Labs is one of many companies the SEC looking at as it investigates the wider industry. Its challenge is not only to make Web3 accessible, but to do so at a time when both scrutiny and skepticism in all things crypto are greater than ever before.""Yuga isn't impacted by anything that's happened directly, but what's happened is horrible and I think hurts the entire industry,"" Aronow said of FTX's collapse. ""This was something that a large portion of the space trusted, thought was a good guy, and now we're seeing behind that mask, and it's ugly.""All Yuga Labs can do now, he said, is focus on its priorities. Its next key project is Otherside, Yuga's concept of the metaverse. While Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, sees the metaverse as a big virtual-reality world, Yuga Labs is going in the opposite direction. To bring in the largest group of people possible, Otherside is being designed to work on web browsers — both PC and mobile. Like World of Warcraft, a game Aronow and Solano have sunk countless hours into, Otherside will be a large fantasy world with quests and a storyline. But it'll also double as a platform, like Roblox and Minecraft, where players often spend time building, roaming and just hanging out. In both Minecraft and Roblox, a large part of the virtual locales players spend time in is built by players and companies, like Nikeland in Roblox, not the game's developers themselves. The difference between these established games and Otherside is the concept of digital ownership. Items you buy or make, unlike in Roblox or games like Fortnite, are treated like digital property — you can sell them, swap them or gift them once you're done.Gamers have thus far proven to be an unexpectedly tough sell on Web3. Though gaming is an obvious next step for NFT technology, gamers have reacted with fury at various studios' attempts to integrate NFTs into their wares. That can be chalked up to both a suspicion of NFTs as well as a history of predatory microtransaction tactics by established gaming companies. Ubisoft, Square Enix and EA have all faced the wrath of disapproving gamers, but Yuga Labs is betting that people will come around once they experience actual digital ownership.""People spend $120 billion each year on digital assets and games on their phone, and those are sunk-cost systems,"" Solano said. Once that money goes in, it can't come out. A proposed purpose of Web3 technology is to change that.           Enlarge Image                Otherside is Yuga Labs' upcoming metaverse game, developed for PC and mobile browsers. Yuga LabsYuga's proposition is that Otherside can use crypto and NFTs to form an in-game economy that would otherwise be impossible. Items created in the game can be owned as NFTs. Selling those NFTs, or creating in-game services people use, can earn you crypto. The idea isn't to create a playground for get-rich-quick schemes, but to develop a platform where people have the same financial incentives to create a digital item as a physical item.""There's a base idea here, which is you want to incentivize creators,"" Solano said. ""The best things that have come out of gaming in the past 20 years or so, much of it is mods and user-generated content and stuff that they can't monetize directly on their own, [so creators are] forced away to go to Patreon."" Solano is referring to games like Skyrim, which have enthusiastic modding communities that are over a decade old, and Dota, a full game that's actually a mod of Warcraft III. One of the most critically acclaimed games of 2021 was Forgotten City, a mod of Skyrim. Aronow and Solano couldn't give a firm release date for Otherside, insisting rather that the platform will open up incrementally. Adopting the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency, it'll be built alongside its community, with regular ""Voyager Trips"" — closed betas — informing how it's built. Crucially, despite it being a Web3 game, you won't need crypto or NFTs to play it. ""Otherside is very much an open platform and an open world,"" said Yuga Labs acting CEO Nicole Muniz, ""because we're looking at the entire ecosystem, and we want to onboard the next 100 million users onto Web3.""Muniz will step down as CEO in the first half of 2022, replaced by Activision Blizzard's departing president and COO, Daniel Alegre. Otherside is ambitious, and its success is far from assured. But Yuga's efforts are worth paying attention to. The speculative bubble that has enveloped the NFT space for much of the past two years has aroused fierce debate over whether there's any actual, mainstream use to the technology. Whichever way it goes, Yuga's metaverse bet will prove someone right.           Enlarge Image                Six CryptoKitties. CryptoKittiesThe world's first ethereum gameNFTs have been linked to gaming almost since their very inception. In November 2017, amid the mania of bitcoin approaching $20,000 for the first time, a firm called Axiom Zen launched an app called CryptoKitties on ethereum. It was billed as the world's first ethereum game.CryptoKitties allowed people to own cartoon cats as tokens on the blockchain. Among the first notable NFT collections, it posed the question: If currency can be owned as tokens on a blockchain, why not digital assets? CryptoKitties was a proof-of-concept experiment, but calling it a ""game"" is a stretch. Axiom Zen allowed around 35,000 CryptoKitties to be minted in the year following the app's launch. If you bought two, you could breed them to create a third CryptoKitty. What a kitty looked like depended on the traits of its parents. Some traits were rarer than others, making some CryptoKitties more valuable than others. At its height, CryptoKitties was popular enough to crash the ethereum blockchain, which wasn't efficient enough to deal with the transaction demand. But interest died off after a few months. ""I bought a couple [CryptoKitties] back in 2017, but it was kind of this blip,"" said Solano. ""It captured crypto Twitter for a moment, everyone was talking about it when it came out, then the model just wasn't there. … I kind of just forgot about it."" Solano had only been into crypto for a few months when CryptoKitties launched, having invested a few hundred dollars in ethereum alongside his brother-in-law on a whim in autumn 2017. Curious about cryptocurrency, Solano joked that he ""put the hook in"" Aronow, knowing that Aronow, once sufficiently titillated by a new idea, would tirelessly research the topic and ""crush you with all the stuff he dug up about it.""Aronow's propensity for falling down rabbit holes, for immersing himself in various virtual worlds, is in large degree related to his battle with colitis. He dropped out of college due to the disease, and said he spent much of the next decade stuck at home.""There were periods of peaks and valleys, times where I was more than capable of going outside,"" he explained. ""But for the vast majority of that, I was bed to bathroom.""It was only in early 2021 that Aronow's condition abated, which he chalks up to a combination of Western medicine, alternative medicine and diet. It was almost exactly three months after he started feeling better, Aronow said, when he got a text message from Solano: ""Hey, wanna make an NFT?""           Enlarge Image                Sixteen of the 10,000 CryptoPunks. The NFT collection launched in 2017 for free. They now regularly sell for six figures.  Yuga LabsThe NFT playbookCryptoKitties aroused a huge amount of attention for a few months, but the longterm NFT success story of 2017 was CryptoPunks. Launched for free by Larva Labs in 2017, it's a collection of 10,000 pixelated avatars that's considered the first profile-picture (PFP)   collection. It's famous for encoding traits into the tokens — different hairstyles, accessories and clothing — making some more valuable than others. In many ways it wrote the playbook followed by NFT creators four years later. Most NFT volume comes from such PFP collections, and most of those collections feature around 10,000 pieces.Aronow and Solano were inspired by CryptoPunks, and followed many of its cues. But in creating the Bored Ape Yacht Club, they ended up writing the NFT playbook's second edition. BAYC boasted a few key differences from other early 2021 projects. For instance, every Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT costs 0.08 ether, about $230. At the time, so-called ""bonding curves"" were in fashion, where the price of minting an NFT went up as more were sold. In one egregious example, the first NFTs cost 0.1 ether to mint, while the last cost 100 ether. The Bored Ape Yacht Club also came with a roadmap. While CryptoPunks began and ended with art, BAYC promised prolonged benefits to owning the NFT: merch drops, access to games and more. Last and perhaps most crucially, buying a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT also meant buying the IP for that ape. The most famous example is actor Seth Green, who's working on a sitcom featuring his ape. One BAYC owner used their simian as a mascot for a burger restaurant (Bored and Hungry), while a pair of friends bought an ape and, creating a backstory for it, turned it into an author, writing a whole book (Bored and Dangerous) in character. Just this month Adidas used its ape, who it named Indigo Herz, in its World Cup advertisement.            Enlarge Image                Adidas' Bored Ape, Indigo Herz, had a cameo in the company's recent World Cup 2022 ad.  AdidasHolders of Bored Ape NFTs are incentivized to use their ape to expand the brand. The more that image is spread, the more valuable, in theory, the NFTs become. That's good for holders and for Yuga Labs, which takes a 2.5% cut from every BAYC NFT sold. Whether this works in the long term is anyone's guess, but it's a type of crowdsourced marketing that only exists in NFTs right now.What didn't take off, however, was the feature that Aronow and Solano actually built the Bored Ape Yacht Club around.When they agreed to ""do an NFT,"" among the duo's first ideas was an NFT that would grant access to a shared canvas. The hope was that a community could form around an artwork everyone contributed a piece to — an idea Muniz, a longtime friend of Aronow who at the time was advising the pair, called ""special"" and ""a little pretentious.""Muniz sensibly guessed that the first thing anyone would do is draw a dick on the canvas, and encouraged Solano and Aronow to work backward from that presumption. The shared canvas eventually became the bathroom wall of a dive bar. That dive bar eventually became part of a yacht club. That yacht club eventually became located in an Everglades swamp, in homage to the pair's Miami upbringing. The yacht club would be populated by apes, cartoonishly embodying the crypto slang ""ape,"" an affectionate term for investing money without doing any due diligence first: ""I just aped into this coin. I have no idea what it does.""  The ""bored"" part was inspired by crypto Twitter. The pair became fascinated by crypto traders they knew to be worth millions who would spend all their time shitposting on the platform.""There was something deeply fascinating about someone who would post all day about cryptocurrency, and just have like a cat profile picture or whatever, who you could cryptographically verify was worth millions and millions of dollars, and late at night they would be like, 'Who wants to play League of Legends with me? I'm bored,'"" Aronow said.Solano and Aronow paid five artists to design the ape traits. These would be fed into an algorithm, which then generated the 10,000 cartoon primate avatars the world has come to know and love/hate. Two friends, Zeshan Ali and Kerem Atalay, were brought on to write smart contracts and handle the tech side of things. Ali and Atalay are Yuga Labs' other two founders. The upfront cost of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT launch was about $40,000. Months later, after it had become an unexpected success, each of the five artists got paid an additional $1 million for their work. (Seneca, the lead designer, contends her payment was ""not ideal."")Buying an ape would come with the ultimate enticement: the ability to add a pixel to the club's dive-bar bathroom wall every 15 minutes. ""As absurd as it is,"" Solano said, ""that was our way of pushing the space forward at the time.""The bathroom wall collage never took off — but the collection sold out in under 24 hours, generating $2.3 million for Yuga Labs.           Enlarge Image                Ape Fest 2022: One of many Bored Ape holders to get a tattoo of their ape.  Yuga LabsBored Ape summer                                   Josh Ong bought a Bored Ape during the collection's opening sale, paying $235 plus a $15 transaction fee. He still holds it — as I look on OpenSea now, there's an offer on Ong's ape for $85,000. Ong, who's known for wearing the same Hawaiian shirt that his ape dons, said he was curious about the idea of crypto tokens granting access to online communities, and liked the BAYC art enough to drop 0.08 ether on it. The Bored Ape Yacht Club collection did well in the months following launch. Its floor price, which is measured by the cheapest any owner has their NFT listed for, fluctuated between $3,000 and $15,000 until July. But, Ong recalls, it really got going that August when Steph Curry bought an ape for $150,000. Not only did the NBA star use his NFT as a profile picture on Twitter, where he has 17 million followers, he joined and chatted with other holders in the group's Discord, the messaging platform on which most NFT activity occurs.Many more celebrities would buy into the Bored Ape Yacht Club and use their NFTs as a profile picture, including Justin Bieber, Timbaland and Gwyneth Paltrow. Not all of the attention celebrities drummed up for the BAYC brand was positive. A January segment on the Tonight Show featured host Jimmy Fallon comparing his Bored Ape with Paris Hilton's. The interaction was mocked online, and some like Stark criticized it as an example of market manipulation.Still, the higher the Bored Ape Yacht Club's floor price rose, the more celebrities flaunted their apes on social media, the more owning an NFT came to resemble an actual elite club pass. The day after Curry bought his ape, Yuga dropped the Mutant Ape Yacht Club. All BAYC holders were gifted a vial of mutant serum. That serum could be saved or could be used on their existing Bored Ape to create a new Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT.           Enlarge Image                A Bored Ape on the left, a Mutant Ape on the right.  Yuga LabsThe Mutant Ape Yacht Club was designed to both reward holders and to make the brand more accessible. By that time, the Bored Ape floor had risen to a level that made it prohibitively expensive even for those deeply convinced of the future of NFTs. The MAYC collection consisted of 20,000 NFTs: 10,000 from vials airdropped to BAYC holders, and 10,000 that were sold to the public. The public sale was a Dutch auction starting at 3 ether, or about $9,000. It sold out almost immediately, netting Yuga Labs another $96 million.Around that time, Ong held one of the first offline Bored Ape Yacht Club meetups. It was a small affair: A few friends he'd met in the group's Discord were going to be in New York for an NBA game. They thought about ways to market the Bored Ape Yacht Club, ways to bring the disparate community together. Ong organized two more meetups before thinking big: an actual yacht party.Ong got the founders on a Zoom call. ""We had this crazy idea to throw an actual yacht party at NFT.NYC [in November],"" he told them. ""And if Yuga wants to be involved, if you wanna put up some money…""""They looked at each other, they'd just finished the Mutant mint, and said, 'I think we can cover the bill.'""The idea turned into Ape Fest, a party that for the past two years has taken place concurrently with the NFT.NYC convention. In 2021, Ape Fest consisted of a yacht party, an open gallery featuring artwork from the Bored and Mutant Ape collections, and the Strokes-headlined Brooklyn warehouse party to cap it all off. The founders were unsure about how much demand there would be, how possible it would be to transfer energy from Discord to real life. When they arrived at the gallery space where Ape Fest wristbands were being given out on day one, they found a line wrapped around four city blocks. Solano helped give out wristbands. Because the founders were still pseudonymous, most people assumed he was venue staff — someone even asked if he was a Yuga intern. Later, Ong recalls, when artworks were being set up in the gallery, Aronow entered the room to help, but was blocked by security.""He got bounced from his own event,"" Ong chuckled.Doxxed Ape Yacht ClubAronow and Solano made the decision to remain pseudonymous at Ape Fest 2021, not making their real identities as BAYC founders known. Looking back, they now say they were ""overthinking it.""For better or worse, pseudonymity is a foundational feature of Web3 culture. The Bored Ape founders originally ""doxxed"" themselves after discovering that a BuzzFeed reporter who'd uncovered Aronow's and Solano's identities intended to publish a story about them.Got doxxed against my will. Oh well.Web2 me vs. Web3 me pic.twitter.com/uLkpsJ5LvN— GordonGoner.eth (Wylie Aronow) (@GordonGoner) February 5, 2022 Got doxed so why not. Web2 me vs Web3 me. pic.twitter.com/jfmzo5NtrH— Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 5, 2022 Bad actors frequently use the pseudonymity that's accepted in Web3 for ill ends. Sketchy founders are able to create a project, be it a cryptocurrency or an NFT collection, make money, vanish before fulfilling whatever utility they promised, and then repeat the process. I asked Muniz, Yuga's current CEO, if pseudonymity becomes a liability for a company with the size and mainstream ambition of Yuga. ""We really think of Yuga as an experiment on Web3 values,"" Muniz said. Web3 isn't just about owning your digital assets, she said, but owning your identity too. It's a principle applied to both the products Yuga makes and the way the company itself runs. ""We have people on staff that are fully pseudonymous, I don't know their real name. I could, as CEO, go to HR and say, 'I wanna know this person's name,' but I would never do that. … The 'real identity' thing, I can't speak to what other people are doing, but I do think people should have that choice. You should be able to own your identity."" Aronow and Solano rejected the suggestion that there was anything untoward about their pseudonymity. ""Number one, three months before we ever launched the collection, we were an LLC registered in Delaware and the state of Virginia,"" Solano said. ""We were never hiding, we were just pseudonymous. We were just interacting in a way that frankly is very natural in the space and very natural to what a lot of people of our generation that have grown up playing MMORPGs, or living on AIM."" Welp, here we go...Hey, I'm Zeshan. Nice to meet y'all (:Web2 me vs. Web3 me pic.twitter.com/0AnqurQ1el— Sass (Zeshan Ali) (@SassBAYC) February 8, 2022 Seems like the cat is out of the bag anyway, so...Hi, I'm Kerem 👋🍅web2 me vs. web3 me pic.twitter.com/v7i4JDCTlc— EmperorTomatoKetchup (Kerem Atalay) (@TomatoBAYC) February 8, 2022 The issue of pseudonymity is polarizing even within the NFT space. The wisdom of the accepting the practice was questioned in May when the founder of a popular collection, Azuki, was discovered to have started and abandoned two previous NFT projects. ""I wouldn't trust anyone who's not doxxed,"" a former Pixar designer-turned-NFT creator told me at NFT.NYC in June. The Bored Ape founders were doxxed for four months by the time of NFT.NYC 2022, and would no longer be confused as interns. Yuga's founders spent Ape Fest 2022 in June being crowded by community members eager for selfies and autographs. Their personal space wasn't the only thing more crowded that year. Ape Fest was another example of the NFT industry at large following Yuga's path. At NFT.NYC 2022, NFT brands competed with one another to host the biggest party with the most famous guests. Madonna performed at World of Women's NFT.NYC party, while Doodles' show featured an announcement that Pharrell Williams was coming on as chief brand officer, which preceded a performance by The Chainsmokers. Meanwhile, Ape Fest 2022 turned into an actual music festival, with four days of performances by the likes of Lil' Wayne, LCD Soundystem and The Roots. It was headlined by Eminem and Snoop Dogg debuting a music video in which they transform into their Bored Apes.            Enlarge Image                Ape Fest 2022 was headlined by Eminem and Snoop Dogg debuting a new video featuring their Bored Apes.  Yuga LabsBuilding the clubWhen Aronow and I first spoke, I asked him what he thought about the wave of NFTs making promises they were never actually going to keep. Various collections have claimed improbable goals of disrupting fashion, fitness and gaming. In response, he told me about DentaCoin.In the 2017 crypto bull run, while he and Solano were on crypto Twitter every day, Aronow encountered a cryptocurrency called DentaCoin. It claimed it would forever change the dental industry through blockchain wizardry. It may have sounded plausible to the uninitiated but, to people in crypto, it was an obvious and absurd marketing tactic. ""There's a lot of feasibility for the future use cases of NFTs, but with every bull run comes the DentaCoin,"" Aronow said. ""There's always the people who are going to try and take advantage of a situation, and it may not be easy for the public to suss out what's legitimate and what's not."" There were dozens of NFT collections being pumped out each day in the months following Bored Ape Yacht Club's success. Few register on anyone's radar. I asked the Bored Ape founders how much of their success could be chalked up to being at the right place at the right time. There was a brief moment of silence.""We didn't sleep at all afterwards,"" Solano said of the period following the April 2021 BAYC launch. ""We spent that whole summer, and eight months later, working 14 hours a day."" It was nearly 8 p.m ET and the sound of Slack notifications popping off was easily audible in Solano's background. Aronow added: ""Within a few months of selling out, we were in Garga's mom's backyard in the middle of the summer heat, packaging up hats and T-shirts, figuring out how to fulfill merch orders, in the middle of COVID. ""And then, shortly after that, throwing a giant festival on a yacht and a giant Brooklyn warehouse. I hadn't worked in a decade, Greg was a book publisher, Zeshan and Tomato were software engineers, and we were figuring out how to throw major concerts months after selling out the collection,"" Aronow said. ""You make your own luck."" Despite helming the most lucrative NFT collections, Aronow and Solano insist the grind of building a company — of working 14 hours a day, every day — means not much has changed. It's only during the occasional break, like watching The Strokes play at a gig you organized, that it hits you.""It's probably been much more surreal for my wife than it has been for myself,"" Solano said. ""She'll overhear a conference call and be like, 'Was that so-and-so? That's crazy, you're talking to these people,' and I'm just like, 'I don't know, I gotta get to the next meeting.'"" If anything in life has changed, Solano says, ""it's just a shitload more Uber Eats."" Web3 DisneyYuga Labs has conquered the NFT world. The Bored Ape Yacht Club is the second biggest NFT collection of all time, and Mutant Apes the third. The only collection to surpass BAYC is CryptoPunks, buoyed by its historical significance as the first notable NFT set.And in March of this year Yuga Labs bought CryptoPunks, the ranked No. 1 in trading volume of any NFT collection ever, off Larva Labs, along with another popular collection in Meebits, ranked No. 11.""I like to use the analog of Web3 Disney,"" said Muniz, who was appointed Yuga Labs CEO in February of 2022. BAYC is Yuga Labs' Mickey Mouse, Muniz explained, while CryptoPunks and Meebits are the company's equivalent of the Star Wars and Marvel acquisitions. Otherside, the metaverse platform Yuga is building, is like its Disney World.            Enlarge Image                Of the 10 top NFT collections of all time, Yuga Labs owns 5: CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Otherdeed for Otherside and Meebits. OpenSeaI asked if there's any contradiction in a Web3 company owning a set of collections that are responsible for between 30% and 40% of the market volume.""This is where we're not like Disney,"" Muniz answered. ""We might own 30% to 40% of the market, but also our holders own 30% to 40% of the market, and I mean that in an IP sense. Our collections are some of the only collections that truly give away IP rights. … You have exclusive commercial IP rights, and that also means, by the way, Yuga does not."" She brought up the example of the art galleries at Ape Fest, which showcase various Bored and Mutant Apes. In each case, Muniz said, they had to ask for the holder's permission to use the ape. When Adidas put its ape, Indigo Herz, in its World Cup ad, Solano said, they didn't need to ask Yuga Labs first. ""The biggest condition for us doing that deal is that we would be able to decentralize the intellectual property,"" Solano added. Prior to Yuga's acquisition, Larva Labs retained IP rights to CryptoPunks. ""That was the thing that was most important to us. That was the thing that underpinned our reasoning for all of this.""This success, as lucrative as it's thus far proven to be, is limited by its concentration on NFT circles. To grow from here, Yuga needs to onboard more people to NFT space — or make a product that appeals to people who would never buy an NFT. Otherside is designed to be the solution to both problems. A big birthday breakThe Bored Ape Yacht Club rang in its first birthday in a big way: by breaking ethereum. On April 30, 2022, Yuga hosted its biggest public sale yet when it launched its Otherdeed collection. Unlike the Bored and Mutant Ape collections, these NFTs aren't designed to be used as profile pictures. They're deeds for virtual land in Otherside.Buying an Otherdeed NFT comes with two benefits. First, holders are able to participate in Otherside's beta tests, give feedback and inform how the game is ultimately made. Second, once Otherside is live, the plot of land depicted in a holder's Otherdeed NFT will become theirs in the game.Yuga is still in the first of three development phases for Otherside, so can't confirm the precise parameters of land ownership. Other Web3 metaverses, like Sandbox, allow players to use their land to set up shops, farm resources, build accommodation, rent spaces out for events and host advertisements. In total, 55,000 Otherdeeds were sold, raising about $320 million for Yuga Labs. But ethereum proved unable to handle the load, and was inaccessible for about three hours. Many people paid $1,500 in fees for transactions that failed — meaning they were unable to mint their NFT — showcasing a glaring weakness of blockchain technology.            Enlarge Image                Four Otherdeed NFTs that represent plots of land in Otherside. There will eventually be 200,000 Otherdeed plots.  Yuga Labs""It's incredibly challenging,"" Solano said. ""We knew the right thing to do would be to reimburse people for lost gas fees, so that was a huge priority for us."" Yuga Labs paid $265,000 in refunds for people who paid ether for failed transactions. ""It's the insane level of demand we've experienced at different points, the same way when we had lines four ways around the block,"" Solano added. ""It's like, 'Wow, amazing, people want to come see this,' but also 'Fuck, we have lines four ways around the block.'"" Otherdeed holders — of which there are just under 34,000 — are sure to be excited about Yuga's metaverse. Overcoming the wider public's uncertainty, suspicion and resentment of NFTs will be the true test. Stark, the former SEC enforcer, questions whether the NFT space can untether itself from rampant speculation. ""Once you turn it into a marketplace it's no longer a place where people play the game, it's a place where everybody's trying to get cool stuff so they can sell it for more money,"" he said. ""If you want to flex with some really cool-looking cartoon character, that's your world, have at it. I think that's not the reality. … What everybody is selling is this notion that you're gonna get rich.""Yet in other areas where NFTs have historically been criticized, substantial progress has been made. A common, justifiable objection to the adoption of NFTs has been the enormous carbon footprint of ethereum, the blockchain on which most NFTs are built. But in September the blockchain adopted a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, changing the way new cryptocurrency is ""mined,"" lowering its carbon output by over 99%.  ""If that was truly where the reticence lied, that's now been solved,"" Solano said. ""Have feelings changed as drastically as the facts? Not yet."" Muniz is confident that the technology will eventually win people over, that we're still at the ""56k modem"" stage of Web3. Aronow is aware of the baggage that terms like ""NFT"" and ""metaverse"" come with, and says the names might eventually be changed to be more palatable to mainstream audiences. But regardless of the name, Aronow says that eventually people will see the inherent value of owning their digital goods.""It's only a matter of time before a company, hopefully ours, is going to demonstrate that value through a really fun game,"" he said. ""That's going to open the flood gates. There's no going back from that moment.""",2022-12-13

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Continues To Be At A High Value As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC long-term holders have been moving their coins recently. The “NVT ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the transaction volume on the chain (both in USD). What this metric tells us is whether the value of the cryptocurrency (the market cap) is comparable to the ability to transact coins or not (the volume). When the value of the metric is high, it means BTC is overvalued right now as transaction volumes are low compared to the market cap. On the other hand, low values imply the crypto may be undervalued currently.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  Related Reading:  Quant Explains How This Nasdaq Support Retest Could Also Help Reverse Bitcoin The “NVT Golden Cross” is an indicator that compares the long-term (30-day MA) and the short-term (10-day MA) trends of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms in the metric.

I like to approach these questions by thinking about what kinds of tools people could benefit the most from in their everyday lives.In the Philippines, the biggest recent crypto macro trend that has taken place is the play-to-earn phenomenon. Over the last two years or so, we have seen up to three or four million people every day playing Web3 games that allow them to earn cryptocurrency. But rather than hold their earnings as crypto, most of them sell for fiat almost immediately so they can spend it in the real world. Converting directly into fiat, of course, involves a lot more friction, cost and regulatory hurdles than a simple crypto-to-crypto transaction.So what really needs to be built are stablecoins denominated not in U.S. dollars but in local currencies like the Philippine peso. And similar to a CBDC, these stablecoins could be issued with some type of permission or guidance from the respective country’s central bank.Now, it might be some time before we have a widely adopted use case for this kind of local currency stablecoin. But based on the direction that this technology is heading, it’s likely something that the industry will start building soon, and that regulatory authorities will want to get involved in the process. In the real world, fiat still dominatesWe don’t live in the metaverse yet — we live in the real world, and in the real world, fiat currency still dominates. Until the day comes when we transpose our time, energy, and income onto the metaverse, there’s a very strong use case for local currency stablecoins.If you’re an early crypto adopter who scored big or a wealthy individual who wants to hold a percentage of your assets in crypto as a speculative bet, you can afford to sit on your stash and wait for that day. But for everyday people with household budgets and bills to pay, you want to make sure that a certain percentage of your digital assets keep pace with your day-to-day costs.Currently, the largest stablecoins with established backing and ample liquidity are designed to track the U.S. dollar. This year, the value of the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly against most currencies, including in the developing world, as the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively raises rates to combat inflation amidst major global economic uncertainty. In other words, if you are holding USD-linked stablecoins in a country that’s outside the U.S., you’re probably doing pretty well.But this won’t always be true, and several global currencies have experienced fairly volatile trading this year. At the end of the day, holding a currency other than your home country’s currency opens you up to foreign exchange risk, and that is not the right choice for many investors, especially for those on the lower end of the income scale.Transactions that are purely in the crypto world are relatively more frictionless and cost less. Local currency stablecoins would allow residents of smaller economies to keep their funds in the crypto world until they need to transfer them into fiat. They wouldn’t need to worry about mistiming the market and losing out due to a foreign exchange swing.Then, when it does come time to spend their well-earned funds in the real economy, regulations-compliant platforms will be standing by to help them legally transition their money into fiat.Monetary sovereigntyI’ve outlined why local currency stablecoins would be a helpful financial tool for users in places like the Philippines. Now, let me share why I believe traditional monetary authorities like central banks should have an interest in helping to build and regulate these mechanisms — especially in economies like those of the ASEAN region.As I said before, we don’t live in the metaverse just yet. But policymakers and regulators need to pay attention to the fact that these online blockchain-connected communities are being built up rapidly by some of the biggest and most well-resourced tech companies in the world, and that what you’re seeing now is that U.S. dollars — or dollar-linked stablecoins — are becoming the default underlying currency of the digital world, including the metaverse.As we continue moving into the digital asset space, regional authorities in places like the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and even Singapore will realize that losing sovereignty over your money is the biggest risk to a small or medium-sized country and its monetary policy.If we do see more economic activity start to occur on the blockchain and in the metaverse, where stablecoins like USDC or USDT are the settlement currency, then basically local governments and central banks don’t really have sovereignty over the currency in that realm, even if it makes up a growing portion of economic activity in their countries.It’s important to think of it this way because governments are very sensitive about their mandate to regulate the supply and demand of money, and if a lot of what your local people and companies are doing from a growth perspective is being pushed into the U.S. dollar sphere, that may be economically detrimental in the long run, particularly for a fast-growing economy like the Philippines.Right now, it doesn’t look to me like CBDCs are high on the agenda for many of the central banks around the region, and that’s understandable given the unprecedented monetary challenges of the present environment. But the most forward-looking monetary authorities should start thinking about these issues sooner rather than later.",2022-12-13

The U.S. will likely request his extradition, according to Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder.FTX, formerly one of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, along with its brokerage arm and hedge fund Alameda Research and dozens of other affiliated companies.The collapse caused billions of dollars of losses worldwide, with accusations of operational misconduct alleging FTX misappropriated, or comingled, client deposits for trading by Alameda.Who’s next?This has led to speculation the former heads of Alameda, Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco, may also face indictment.“A lot depends on the sealed indictment,” Braden Perry, ​​former senior trial attorney at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and partner at law firm Kennyhertz Perry, told Forkast.“If the U.S. alleges conspiracy to commit any of the crimes, there could be a number of FTX executives charged. Based on the comingling concerns, I would not be surprised if Ellison, Trabucco, and potentially others are charged.”See related article: FTX failure a ‘wake-up call’ for security, says former Mt Gox CEO Mark KarpelesThe indictment has likely been in the works for days between law enforcement officials, and the timing shows the urgency behind U.S. authorities wanting Bankman-Fried in custody, said Perry.However, Perry, who is not directly involved in the case, cautioned that the extradition process will be heavily negotiated with his lawyers and could take weeks or months if Bankman-Fried fights the procedure.“It’s early to speculate, but due to his refusal to voluntarily enter the U.S. prior to his arrest, it could be a lengthy process,” he said. ​​Flight risk?Perry said that Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify on Tuesday at the House Financial Services Committee hearing, and “the arrest may have been due to his refusal to testify in person and to remain overseas,” Perry said.“There was also speculation that SBF had planned to flee the Bahamas for a non-extradition country. The arrest could be a response to those rumors as well,” Perry said.Richard Levin, chair of fintech and regulation practice of law firm Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough, told Forkast that with Bankman-Fried in custody he will not give testimony before Congress. “If he is out on bond, he could give testimony. However, I would believe it would be unlikely for him to do so if he has been indicted,” said Levin, who is not directly involved in the case.Facing timeBankman-Fried, if convicted, could face decades in prison, Perry and Levin told Forkast last month.“With respect to the criminal sanctions, depending on the number of violations and the dollar value of violations, under the federal sentencing guidelines, you could be looking at potential criminal liability that could exceed 20 years of incarceration,” Levin said.Perry said Bankman-Fried could even face “life in federal prison without the possibility of supervised release.”See related article: Sam Bankman-Fried probed over Terra-LUNA crash: reportCryptocurrency critic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren waded in on Twitter:  “I’ve long urged [The Department of Justice] to hold corporate executives personally accountable when their companies break the law,” she wrote.“Crypto executives who break the law are just like any other crooks. If Sam Bankman-Fried committed fraud, then federal prosecutors should send him to prison.”Piling upThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also indicated it will file charges against Bankman-Fried.“We commend our law enforcement partners for securing the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried on federal criminal charges, Gurbir Grewal, the director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement head, said on Monday in the U.S.Bankman-Fried has repeatedly denied any knowledge of improper use of customer funds.While he said last month at the New York Times DealBook Summit that criminal liability is not his biggest concern, he has hired white-collar crime specialist Mark Cohen to represent him, a Bankman-Fried spokesperson told Forkast last week.John J. Ray III, the new chief executive of FTX.com, said the company’s failure was caused by the “concentration of control in a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals,” in his testimony prepared ahead of Tuesday’s House Financial Services Committee hearing.At FTX’s first bankruptcy hearing last month, an attorney for the company said it was run as a “personal fiefdom” of Sam Bankman-Fried and that a “substantial amount of assets” has either been stolen or gone missing.",2022-12-13

Through a new app, “Send Globally” which uses the bitcoin Lightning Network, millions of users can transfer their GBP and EUR funds and convert them into local fiat currencies in Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria. Lightening Network Used for Cross-Border Payments Crypto exchange CoinCorner partnered with bitcoin app Bitnob to develop a solution that allows free cross-border payments from Europe and UK to Africa through the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The solution, ‘Send Globally,’ will allow millions to transfer and convert their British pounds (GBP) or euros (EUR) to local fiat currencies in Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya. The fund transfers will be facilitated via the Lightning Network – a layer 2 protocol built on Bitcoin that enables fast transactions across a network of participants. In this case, Lightning Network will convert EUR and GBP funds into BTC and then into the local currencies in Africa, which are ultimately deposited into the receiver’s bank account or mobile wallet app. “When a CoinCorner customer uses Send Globally, their pounds will be automatically converted into Bitcoin (BTC) and sent via the Lightning Network. Once the BTC is received at Bitnob, it will be instantly converted into the local currency — NGN, KES or GHS — and the recipient will receive the funds straight into their bank account or mobile money wallet.”CoinCorner partners with Bitnob to facilitate cross-border transactions from UK and Europe to Africa According to World Bank Open Data, roughly $14.8 billion are transferred from the UK and Europe to Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana each year. Until now, these transfers have been typically conducted through a third-party payment facilitator such as Western Union. Such fund transfers rely on centralized entities and have longer processing times and hefty transaction fees. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most expensive region to transfer money to, said Bitnob CEO Bernard Parah, as sending $200 cost “an average of 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.”    Join our Telegram group and never miss a breaking digital asset story.   Lightning Network Continues Driving BTC Mainstream Adoption Danny Scott, CEO of CoinCorner, said the remittance market represents “a huge opportunity for Bitcoin.” The cryptocurrency’s “borderless nature” makes it an ideal money transfer method, and thanks to the Lightning Network, transferring Bitcoin is instant and very cheap, Scott added. Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey’s Cash App launched a feature that allows users to receive Bitcoin through Lightning Network.

The figures show SHIB has been adding well over 600 new HODLers per day. The figure is down from around 1,500 new wallets holding $SHIB earlier this year as the slowdown in the cryptocurrency space has also been affecting trading volumes and retail investors’ interest in the space. Nevertheless, the number of SHIB holders has been growing even at a time in which the meme-inspired cryptocurrency’s price has been plunging along with that of other leading digital currencies, affected by the collapse of FTX, which hit investor confidence. Over the past 30 days, SHIB is down over 10%.

According to the Times, prosecutors have been investigating the company's ""sudden implosion"" from a $32 billion company to bankruptcy in a matter of days.Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify virtually on Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services prior to his arrest, reported CNBC. His attorneys told the outlet, however, that he will not testify.Under the current extradition treaty signed by the U.S. and the Bahamas in 1990, extraditable offenses include those that break the law of both governments.

Neither the Attorney General of the Bahamas nor the Royal Bahamas Police Force would confirm the nature of the charges against Bankman-Fried.The SEC has initiated a separate set of charges against Bankman-Fried. The agency filed a civil complaint against him Tuesday, alleging that the ex-CEO of FTX engaged in a ""scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX."" The filing said Bankman-Fried raised more than $1.8 billion from investors and that ""unbeknownst to those investors ... Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform's customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.""The charges could land Bankman-Fried in prison for decades, legal experts told CNBC. But before he ever serves time, U.S. prosecutors have to secure an extradition from the Bahamas back to New York. An effort to extradite""It is inconceivable to me that the Justice Department would have charged this case unless they were confident that they could extradite him,"" Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told CNBC.Mariotti anticipates an extradition will take weeks to complete.""The statement by the Bahamian government suggests that they're going to cooperate,"" Mariotti said.

Because Bankman-Fried hasn't been convicted in the Bahamas yet, U.S. prosecutors had to secure an arrest warrant and provide sufficient evidence to the Bahamas that he had committed a crime.Extradition is the first step in a process that could take years. Given the magnitude of Bankman-Fried's alleged crimes, prosecutors and regulators will be pursuing concurrent cases around the world.A trial in the U.S. ""may not occur for years,"" Mariotti said.""The more that they charge, the bigger that the case is, the more time they're going to need to get in motion,"" he said. ""I would say late 2023 is the earliest a trial would occur.""Prosecutors could argue that FTX breached its fiduciary duty by allegedly using customer funds to artificially stabilize the price of the company's self-issued FTT coin, Mariotti said.Intent is also a factor in fraud cases, and Bankman-Fried insists he didn't know about potentially fraudulent activity. He told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook conference that he ""didn't knowingly commingle funds.""""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said.In prepared testimony for the House Financial Services committee, new FTX CEO John Ray confirmed that commingling of funds had occurred between FTX and Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund. Other legal troubleBeyond the criminal charges set to be unveiled Tuesday morning and the civil case brought by the SEC, Bankman-Fried is also facing possible civil actions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and state banking and securities regulators, said Richard Levin, who chairs the fintech and regulation practice at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough.The CFTC and lawmakers have begun their probes into FTX and Bankman-Fried, who told Sorkin he was down to his last $100,000.Lawmakers also expressed their satisfaction at Bankman-Fried's arrest. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who chairs the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, applauded both the Justice Department and Bahamian law enforcement ""for holding Sam Bankman-Fried accountable.""Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, echoed that sentiment but expressed disappointment that Bankman-Fried was arrested before his House testimony, which was scheduled for Tuesday.""I am surprised to hear that Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas at the direction of the United States Attorney,"" Waters said in a statement.""[The] American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that've harmed over one million people,"" Waters said.Prior to his arrest, Bankman-Fried had also been invited to appear before the Senate at a hearing Wednesday.It's unclear whether the SEC or the CFTC will take the lead in securing civil damages.""The question of who would be taking the lead there, whether it be the SEC or CFTC, depends on whether or not there were securities involved,"" Mariotti told CNBC.SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who met with Bankman-Fried and FTX executives earlier this year, has said publicly that ""many crypto tokens are securities,"" which would make his agency the primary regulator.But many exchanges, including FTX, have crypto derivatives platforms that sell financial products such as futures and options, which fall under the CFTC's jurisdiction.""For selling unregistered securities without a registration or an exemption, you could be looking at the Securities Exchange Commission suing for disgorgement — monetary penalties,"" said Levin, who's represented clients before both agencies.Investors who have lost their savings aren't waiting. Class-action suits have already been filed against FTX endorsers, including comedian Larry David and football superstar Tom Brady. One suit excoriated the celebrities for allegedly failing to do their ""due diligence prior to marketing [FTX] to the public.""FTX's industry peers are also filing suit against Bankman-Fried. Failed lender BlockFi sued Bankman-Fried in November, seeking unnamed collateral that the FTX founder provided for the crypto lending firm.FTX and Bankman-Fried had previously rescued BlockFi from insolvency in June, but when FTX failed, BlockFi was left with a similar liquidity problem and filed for bankruptcy protection in New Jersey.Bankman-Fried has also been sued in Florida and California federal courts. He faces class-action suits in both states over what a California court filing called ""one of the great frauds in history.""The largest securities class-action settlement was for $7.2 billion in the Enron accounting fraud case, according to Stanford research. The possibility of a multibillion-dollar settlement would come on top of civil and criminal fines that Bankman-Fried faces. A life behind barsIf the DOJ were able to secure a conviction, a judge would look to several factors to determine how long to sentence him.Based on the size of the losses, if Bankman-Fried is convicted on any of the fraud charges, he could be behind bars for years — potentially for the rest of his life, said Braden Perry, a partner at Kennyhertz Perry who advises clients on anti-money laundering, compliance and enforcement issues.But the length of any potential sentence is hard to predict, said Perry, who was previously a senior trial lawyer for the CFTC, FTX's only official U.S. regulator.Federal sentencing guidelines follow a numeric system to determine the maximum and minimum allowable sentence, but the system can be esoteric. The scale, or ""offense level,"" starts at one, and maxes out at 43.A wire fraud conviction rates as a seven on the scale, with a minimum sentence ranging from zero to six months.But mitigating factors and enhancements can alter that rating, Perry told CNBC.""The dollar value of loss plays a significant role. Under the guidelines, any loss above $550 million adds 30 points to the base level offense,"" Perry said. FTX customers have lost billions of dollars.""Having 25 or more victims adds 6 points, [and] use of certain regulated markets adds 4,"" Perry said.That means Bankman-Fried could be facing life in federal prison, without the possibility of supervised release, if he's convicted on just one of the offenses that prosecutors will reportedly pursue.If convicted, his sentence could be reduced by mitigating factors.""In practice, many white-collar defendants are sentenced to lesser sentences than what the guidelines dictate,"" Perry said. Even in large fraud cases, that 30-point enhancement previously mentioned can be considered punitive.By way of comparison, Stefan Qin, the Australian founder of a $90 million cryptocurrency hedge fund, was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud.Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, a Swedish national accused by the United States of defrauding more than 3,500 victims of over $16 million, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed to this report.",2022-12-13

This is, however, rapidly changing since the collapse of FTX. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides As Markets Brace For Fed Policy Decision And Inflation Data – What To Expect Although a devastating loss for the crypto community, the implosion of FTX has worked to remind crypto users that self-custody remains the safest way to store their coins. As such, hardware wallet manufacturers such as Ledger and Trezor have reported a significant increase in sales and orders since the FTX debacle, with the latter reporting a 300% surge in sales revenue just a week after. Software self-custody wallets such as Trust Wallet have also seen higher patronage during this time. The Trust Wallet token (TWT) saw a 150% uptick in price in less than a week following this and traffic increased by more than 22% in November.  ",2022-12-13

Amazon commissions FTX mini-series Another crypto shocker: Major player actually corrects $400m mistake instead of cratering  News of the arrest comes just over a month after FTX imploded leaving around $8 billion of customers' funds inaccessible. FTX won many of those customers by promoting itself as a safe and secure option – akin to a bank – for those who invest in cryptocurrency and other tokenized assets. But it has since emerged that the company made only token efforts at governance and didn't even bother to keep a list of its bank accounts. Allegedly FTX also loaned customers' funds to a related company, Alameda Research, to help it cover losses on crypto trades.        As the crypto market roiled, that loan created a liquidity crisis at FTX. An attempt to sell FTX to rival Binance imploded once the latter company saw FTX's books and ran a mile to avoid any whiff of an entanglement or association.        The facts of the case mean The Register imagines the US Attorney's Office has a smorgasbord of possible crimes with which to charge Bankman-Fried.

FTX and its units had already attracted scrutiny from regulators around the world. Here's a roundup of what global authorities are doing about FTX: BAHAMAS Police in the Bahamas arrested Bankman-Fried on Dec 12, after the Caribbean nation received formal notification from the United States of criminal charges against him. FTX's group headquarters is in the Bahamas. The Securities Commission of the Bahamas in November froze the assets of FTX Digital Markets, the group's local unit, and also appointed a provisional liquidator for the unit. UNITED STATES FTX is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Justice Department, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to a source familiar with the investigations. The SEC on Dec 12 said it had authorised charges against Bankman-Fried relating to violations of securities laws. Separately, US prosecutor Damian Williams said he expected to move to unseal an indictment against Bankman-Fried on Dec 13. EUROPE/CYPRUS Cyprus's Securities and Exchange Commission asked FTX EU to suspend its operations on Nov 9. FTX announced in September it had received approval from the Cypriot regulator to operate as a Cyprus Investment Firm, allowing the company to fully own a local investment firm it had previously acquired. This allowed FTX EU to serve the European Economic Area.                    ",2022-12-13

The attention being garnered by Osmosis could bring attention to Cosmos’ ecosystem and help Cosmos Hub grow. However, despite the attention being directed towards the Cosmos ecosystem, the sentiment against the cryptocurrency remained negative. As can be seen from the image below, the weighted sentiment for Cosmos Hub remained negative throughout the last few months.      This indicated that the crypto community had more negative than positive things to say about Cosmos Hub. Source: Santiment This negative sentiment did not impact Comos’ total value locked (TVL) to a great extent. As can be seen in the chart given below, Comos Hub’s TVL witnessed an uptick after 22 November. Since then, Cosmos’ TVL hasn’t seen too much volatility.  At the time of writing, Cosmos’ TVL stood at $398,000 according to DefiLlama. Source: Defi Llama Even though the TVL did not decline as much, ATOM witnessed a massive depreciation in terms of price.

Since then ATOM’s price had been oscillating between the $10.57 and $9.60 levels. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 38.92, which indicated that the momentum was with the sellers at the time of writing.

Bankman-Fried had been under criminal investigation by US and Bahamian authorities following the collapse last month of FTX. The firm filed for bankruptcy on November 11, when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.“We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,” Williams said.FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried to Testify Before US House Committee Next WeekBahamian Attorney General Ryan Pinder said the Bahamas would “promptly” extradite Bankman-Fried to the US once the indictment is unsealed and US authorities make a formal request. FTX is headquartered in the Bahamas and Bankman-Fried has largely remained in his Bahamian luxury compound in Nassau since the company's failure.A spokesman for Bankman-Fried had no comment Monday evening. Bankman-Fried has a right to contest his extradition, which could delay but not likely stop his transfer to the US.Bankman-Fried's arrest comes just a day before he was due to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the committee, said she was “disappointed” that the American public, and FTX's customers, would not get to see Bankman-Fried testify under oath.FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried to Face Market Manipulation Inquiry: ReportBankman-Fried was one of the world's wealthiest people on paper, with an estimated net worth of $32 billion. He was a prominent personality in Washington, donating millions of dollars toward mostly left-leaning political causes and Democratic political campaigns. FTX grew to become the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.That all unraveled quickly last month, when reports called into question the strength of FTX's balance sheet. Customers moved to withdraw billions of dollars, but FTX could not meet all the requests because it apparently used its customers deposits to cover bad bets at Bankman-Fried's investment arm, Alameda Research.Bankman-Fried said recently that he did not “knowingly” misuse customers' funds, and said he believes his millions of angry customers will eventually be made whole.The House Financial Services Committee will still hear testimony Tuesday from current CEO, John Ray III. Ray, who took over FTX on November 11 and is a long-time restructuring specialist, has said in court filings that the financial conditions at FTX were worse than at Enron.Bahamian authorities plan to continue their own investigation into Bankman-Fried.“The Bahamas and the United States have a shared interest in holding accountable all individuals associated with FTX who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law,” said Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis, in a statement.Will crypto tax hurt the industry in India?

In a Dec. 12 response to a report from the Australian Financial Review (AFR), Bankman-Fried used Twitter to deny involvement in or knowledge of a “Wirefraud” group chat on messaging app Signal, which reportedly included members of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, including FTX co-founder Zixiao “Gary” Wang, FTX engineer Nishad Singh and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison.The AFR report said the chat was used to send secret information about FTX and Alameda's operations in the lead-up to its failure.Bankman-Fried however said on Twitter that if the group chat was “true” he “wasn't a member” and was “quite sure it's just false” as he had “never heard of such a group.”If this is true then I wasn't a member of that inner circle(I'm quite sure it's just false; I have never heard of such a group)— SBF (@SBF_FTX) December 12, 2022  Until very recently, Bankman-Fried was expected to appear remotely before a United States House Committee hearing on Dec. 13 to explain the collapse of the FTX exchange. But he was taken into custody by Bahamian authorities on Dec. 12, to face U.S. charges that reportedly include wire and securities fraud and money laundering. Committee Chair Maxine Waters on confirmed later on Dec. 12 that the panel “will not be able to hear” SBF's testimony hearing due to the arrest.Bankman-Fried was also requested to attend a separate hearing on Dec. 14 with the Senate Committee on Banking but had never confirmed his attendance, with his lawyers reportedly refusingto accept a subpoena compelling his testimony, according to a Dec. 12 joint statement from Senators Sherrod Brown and Pat Toomey.Related: $75M worth of FTX’s political donations at risk of being recalled due to bankruptcy: ReportChief restructuring officer and FTX CEO John Ray, in written testimony released ahead of his appearance at the House Committee hearing, said FTX customer assets were “commingled” with Alameda’s funds.Ray asserted that Alameda “used client funds to engage in margin trading which exposed customer funds to massive losses” and the trading firm's business model required it to deploy those funds to “various [...] exchanges which were inherently unsafe.” ",2022-12-13

An expanded view of candlestick charts with improved performance, optimized display of time-in-force (TIF) orders, and improved lists of open orders, positions, and order history are added to give users a seamless trading experience. Smooth trading experience: Since the launch of the new trading system on August 1, Poloniex has overhauled the legacy system to give users a new trading platform with higher speed, stability, and usability.  Poloniex’s new matching engine ensures superior performance at transactions per second (TPS) of over 100,000. Users no longer need to wait for the order book to be refreshed when switching trading pairs in the new system, so they can grasp the market trends quicker to make possible gains and enjoy an ultra-fast trading experience.  The new system with an improved disaster tolerance mechanism has a reduced latency so that the system is more stable. In addition, the new trading system optimizes the overall user experience with better functionality and visualization to provide users with a clearer, more intuitive, and friendlier trading experience.   Final Word With the aforementioned updates on Poloniex Futures, the chances of users winning prizes through the Futures Championship have significantly risen. Thus, Poloniex offers its users an excellent opportunity to win exciting prizes like a new iPhone, a Tesla, or even a Maserati by the end of this year. So, grab the opportunity and take part in the Poloniex Futures Championship. Disclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

The Bahamas attorney general’s office issued a news release stating that they would be holding Bankman-Fried in anticipation of an extradition request from the U.S. government.                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  His arrest is the first tangible step taken by authorities to hold individuals responsible for the multibillion-dollar catastrophe of FTX. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, expressed “surprise” at his capture and regret that the U.S. Congress isn’t going to be able to hear his side of the story. Operating FTX, Bankman-Fried accumulated billions of dollars in personal wealth. The arrest is a startling reversal of fortune for the 30-year-old mogul who called the shots at one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, which was valued at $32 billion early this year.

According to Reuters (via Rappler), FTX, Bankman-Fried’s parents and senior executives of the company acquired over 20 properties in the Bahamas valued over $120 million during the past two years. In a December 12 interview with Forbes, SBF once again blamed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for his company’s downfall. He alleged that “CZ” intended to stifle competition by destroying FTX. Bitcoin plummeted to a two-year low following the collapse of FTX as investors feared the company’s issues would spread to other crypto organizations, which they did. Meanwhile, New York Times disclosed, citing a source with knowledge of the situation, that Bankman-Fried is charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also carried out a separate set of charges against SBF. Some legal experts say that Bankman-Fried might spend decades behind bars if found guilty of the charges against him. However, U.S. prosecutors must first seek his extradition from the Bahamas to New York before he can begin serving his sentence.

Related: Crypto Twitter explodes over the news of Sam Bankman-Fried's arrest Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, senators including Elizabeth Warren, Tina Smith and Richard Durbin instead have used recent market turmoil to reiterate their calls for Fidelity Investments to wind back its BTC-linked 401(k) retirement product.In a Nov. 21 letter addressed to Fidelity’s CEO Abigail Johnson, the three senators highlighted the FTX debacle as a major reason to step away from offering BTC exposure in retirement plans. “As with all financial products, price fluctuations are an expected feature of the market — and it is shortsighted to believe that setbacks in an industry are an indication that it won’t experience long-term growth,” said Jonah Allon, a press secretary for Adams. Other senators have been piling in on crypto of late, with Jon Tester stating earlier this week that he sees “no reason why” crypto should exist at all and Warren enthusiastically stating that “finally there are more people blowing the bullshit whistle.” ",2022-12-13

Bankman-Fried’s arrest is the first step in a multistage legal process to transfer the onetime crypto billionaire to U.S. custody.  Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York said they would unseal the indictment against Bankman-Fried on Tuesday morning. The New York Times reported that the charges will include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering. The Securities and Exchange Commission also said it will unveil charges against the FTX CEO on Tuesday.  The U.S. and the Bahamas have had an extradition process in place since 1994, when a treaty signed by both countries came into force. Extradition is a legal process in which one jurisdiction—in this case, the U.S.—asks another jurisdiction—in this case, the Bahamas—to surrender someone accused of a crime so he or she can face prosecution.  At this point, the U.S. has not made a formal extradition request to the Bahamas. Yet the extradition treaty allows the Bahamas to make a “provisional arrest” at the urging of the U.S. before the formal extradition request is delivered. A detainee can be held for a maximum of 60 days while the formal request is pending. If the Bahamas agrees to extradite Bankman-Fried, the country would surrender the former FTX CEO to the U.S., along with any other important evidence collected in the Bahamas. But the Caribbean country could decide to defer Bankman-Fried’s transfer as it conducts its own investigation.  “While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, the Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX, with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere,” Philip Davies, the Bahamas’ prime minister, said in a statement on Monday.  The Bahamas’ acceptance of a U.S. extradition request does not confer guilt. “If you’re right on the law, the proceeding doesn’t really involve a trial on the facts. It’s no defense to extradition to say, ‘I’m innocent,’” Harry Sandick, a partner at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP, told Insider.  And extraditions don’t always succeed.  In 2013, the U.S. tried to extradite National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden from the semiautonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong. The city’s government dithered on fulfilling the request, likely because of Snowden’s claims that the U.S. was spying on both mainland China and Hong Kong. The city eventually allowed Snowden to leave the city, claiming the U.S. had submitted a faulty request. (The U.S. suspended its extradition agreement with Hong Kong in 2020 after Beijing imposed a national security law on the city.) Then, in 2018, Canadian authorities arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou at the request of the U.S., which hoped to extradite her to face charges of fraud and sanctions evasion. Beijing soon arrested two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and tied their fates to the outcome of Meng’s extradition request. Meng’s extradition hearings started in January 2020 and lasted until September 2021, when the U.S. agreed to defer Meng’s prosecution, allowing the Huawei CFO to leave Canada. Beijing released the “two Michaels” soon after.  The extradition of the FTX CEO is unlikely to be quite as thorny. Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear in the Magistrate Court in Nassau, the Bahamas’ capital city, on Tuesday, according to the New York Times.  But there’s one scheduled event that Bankman-Fried may no longer be attending: his hearing in front of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee tomorrow, where he was set to appear virtually. Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter examines how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today's executives.

… [+2560 chars]",Cointelegraph,"A United States federal judge has ordered the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC) to serve its lawsuit to the two original founders of the Ooki decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).On Dec. 12, District Judge William Orrick ordered that the U.S. regulator serve Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner, the founders of the decentralized trading platform bZeroX which was the predecessor to Ooki DAO.Bean and Kistner had already settled charges with the CFTC in September relating to illegal commodities offerings on bZeroX, while separate charges were laid against Ooki DAO tokenholders, which was served using a help chat box as well as a notice on its online forum.However, when Judge Orrick later discovered Bean and Kistner were also Ooki DAO tokenholders he reconsidered how the CFTC was to serve the lawsuit.“It seems clear in this case that Ooki DAO has actual notice of the litigation,” Judge Orrick wrote. “But to provide the best practicable notice, the CFTC should serve at least one identifiable Token Holder if that is possible.”The CFTC’s original approach to filing the lawsuit received pushback and crypto industry participants filed amicus briefings in support of Ooki DAO, which argued the CFTC should find Ooki DAO members and serve them directly with the lawsuit.The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California held a hearing on Dec. 7 with the CFTC and those entities who filed amicus briefs to persuade Judge Orrick to reconsider allowing the CFTC to serve Ooki DAO through its help chat box.“At the hearing, the CFTC asserted it knew that some of Ooki DAO’s Token Holders reside and conduct business in the United States because the two founders of Ooki DAO’s predecessor entity, bZeroX LLC, are Token Holders who reside in the United States,” Orrick wrote.“This was new information to me,” he added. “Neither the complaint nor the CFTC’s Motion for Alternative Service mention that the former founders, [Bean and Kistner], are or have been Token Holders.”“The CFTC is now ORDERED to serve Bean and Kistner, in their roles as Ooki DAO Token Holders,” he concluded.Related: CFTC chief says Bitcoin is the only commodity in the wake of FTX collapseOn Sep. 22, the CFTC settled charges against Bean and Kistner for “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” through bZeroX.Simultaneously, it filed its lawsuit against Ooki DAO, alleging it operated the same software as bZeroX after it was given into its control which violated “the same laws as the respondents.”The CFTC was strongly criticized, even by its own people, for bringing the lawsuit without clear regulatory guidelines with CFTC commissioner, Summer Mersinger, calling it a “regulation by enforcement” approach.

Local high school students competed for more than $1 million in prizes, pitching “Shark Tank”-style business ideas to a panel of judges that included David Ortiz, a former Boston Red Sox slugger, and Kevin O’Leary, an actual “Shark Tank” host. But the event’s organizer was a figure better known in academic circles — Joseph Bankman, a longtime tax professor at Stanford Law School and father of Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-disgraced founder of FTX. Wearing a baseball cap with FTX’s logo, Bankman walked onstage to help announce the winners of two $500,000 checks. Behind the scenes, he played the role of FTX diplomat, introducing his son to the head of a Florida nonprofit organization that was helping adults in the area set up bank accounts linked to the crypto exchange’s platform. Two months later, Bankman-Fried promoted the partnership in testimony to Congress, where he was pushing crypto-friendly legislation. In the months before FTX filed for bankruptcy, on Nov. 11, Bankman was a prominent cheerleader for the company, helping to shape the narrative that his son was using crypto to save the world by donating to charity and giving low-income people access to the financial system. Bankman and his wife, Stanford Law professor Barbara Fried, were more than just supportive parents backing their child’s business. Bankman was a paid FTX employee who traveled frequently to the Bahamas, where the exchange was based. Fried did not work for the company, but her son was among the donors in a political advocacy network that she orchestrated. Read now | US Justice Department is split over charging Binance as crypto world falters Now Bankman and Fried are under scrutiny for their connections to a business that collapsed amid accusations of fraud and misuse of customer funds. No evidence has emerged linking them to the potentially criminal practices that caused the exchange to implode. But their son was arrested Monday in the Bahamas after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against him, and his fortune has dwindled to almost nothing. The charitable work that Bankman spearheaded has largely collapsed. The couple’s careers have been upended. Fried, 71, resigned last month as chair of the board of a political donor network, Mind the Gap, which she had helped start to support Democratic campaigns and causes. Bankman, 67, has postponed a Stanford class he had been scheduled to teach in the winter, and he has recruited a white-collar criminal defense lawyer to represent him. The family faces huge legal bills, and they have become the subject of gossip on Stanford’s campus.Advertisement “I had a friend who said, ‘You don’t want to be seen with them,’” said Larry Kramer, a former dean of the law school and a close friend of the Bankman-Fried family. “I don’t see how this doesn’t bankrupt them.” In a statement, Risa Heller, a spokesperson for the couple, said that Bankman worked for FTX for 11 months but that Fried had no role in the company. “Joe has spent a lot of his life trying to figure out ways to lift people up out of poverty,” Heller said. “Most of his time was spent identifying worthy health-related charities.” Bankman-Fried said in an interview that his parents “weren’t involved in any of the relevant parts” of the business. “None of them were involved in FTX balances or risk management or anything like that,” he said.Advertisement Long before their son became a billionaire celebrity, Bankman and Fried were popular faculty members at Stanford, where they have taught since the late 1980s. At their home on campus, they regularly hosted Sunday dinners with friends and colleagues, which multiple attendees compared to a modern salon. A leading taxation expert, Bankman has been an outspoken advocate for simplifying the tax filing system and has testified in Congress on tax matters. He also has a degree in clinical psychology and practices as a therapist. Fried, who retired this year, is an expert on the intersection of law and philosophy, and has written about effective altruism, the charitable movement embraced by Bankman-Fried that uses data to maximize the benefits of donations. In 2018, she helped start Mind the Gap, hoping to bring “Moneyball”-style analytics to political spending, people familiar with her role in the group said. Other reads | Ordinary investors who jumped into Crypto are saying: Now what? The couple’s lives transformed after Bankman-Fried started FTX in 2019. He grew the company into a $32 billion business, cultivating a reputation as a hardworking do-gooder who barely slept and intended to donate his fortune to causes backed by the effective altruist movement. Bankman and Fried supported their son’s work, although Fried expressed concerns about his lifestyle. “The sleep worries me,” she said in an interview with The New York Times in May. “I just hope that it’s not exacting a high price on him.”Advertisement Bankman-Fried’s business and political empire was always a family affair. The FTX founder was a prolific political donor, and he was part of a network of contributors who gave money to groups recommended by Mind the Gap, people familiar with the organization said. He also helped bankroll a nonprofit organization called Guarding Against Pandemics that was run by his 27-year-old brother, Gabe. Bankman was deeply involved in FTX. In its early days, he helped the company recruit its first lawyers. Last year, he joined FTX staff in meetings on Capitol Hill and advised his son as Bankman-Fried prepared to testify to the House Financial Services Committee, a person familiar with the matter said. FTX employees occasionally consulted him on tax-related matters, the person said.Advertisement “From the start, whenever I was useful, I’d lend a hand,” Bankman said on an FTX podcast in August. Bankman visited the FTX offices in the Bahamas as often as once a month, a person who saw him there said. Among the much-younger staff, he cultivated an avuncular persona, regaling employees with stories from his son’s youth, the person said. He and Fried stayed in a $16.4 million house in Old Fort Bay, a gated community in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas; the couple’s names appear on real estate documents, according to Reuters, although Bankman-Fried has said the house was “intended to be the company’s property.”Advertisement Heller said Bankman and Fried “never intended to and never believed they had any beneficial or economic ownership in the house.” As an employee, Bankman focused on FTX’s charitable operations. He put together the Miami event, selecting the teams of high school students who competed for $1 million in FTX grants. Bankman also leveraged family connections to expand FTX’s reach. His sister, Barbara Miller, works in Florida as a political consultant and introduced him to Newton Sanon, CEO of OIC of South Florida, a nonprofit organization that helps people with workforce-development training to promote economic mobility. (Miller did not respond to a request for comment.) Sanon worked with Bankman on a financial literacy initiative for low-to-moderate-income adults enrolled in education programs. As part of the collaboration, students who did not have bank accounts could open one linked to FTX’s platform, giving them the option to spend their money on cryptocurrency. Nobody was pushed to buy digital currencies through FTX, Sanon said, but one participant chose to do so. In Washington, Bankman-Fried invoked the Florida program as he pressed for legislation to make the United States more hospitable to the crypto industry, testifying to a House committee that the initiative would help low-income people “build savings.” After FTX collapsed, however, Sanon informed Bankman that some participants in the FTX initiative may have lost funds they had stored on the platform (including money that students had received as a stipend for joining the program). “They wired money in for us to be able to take care of students,” Sanon said. He declined to specify the amount that the organization received, but he said it was “substantial and very kind.” Bankman used his personal funds to cover the losses, according to his spokesperson. Sanon said that “none of us are happy with how this played out,” but that “those folks were very good to us.” Not all of Bankman’s partners were so lucky. On Nov. 11, the day that FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman wrote to a Chicago nonprofit that had been promised $600,000 by FTX’s charitable arm. The money wasn’t going to materialize, Bankman said, and he couldn’t afford to make up for the shortfall himself. “I’ll be spending substantially all of my resources on Sam’s defense,” he wrote in an email, which was obtained by the Times. Bankman-Fried’s whole family has felt the effects of his actions. Gabe Bankman-Fried resigned from Guarding Against Pandemics in November. (He did not respond to requests for comment.) Fried stepped down from Mind the Gap, which held a meeting last month to elect an interim chair and discuss how to proceed without her, people familiar with the matter said. The stress of the situation is exacting a toll: Bankman looks as if he has aged 10 years in one month, a friend said. Bankman and Fried are part of a small group offering Bankman-Fried legal advice, according to a person familiar with the matter. The couple has also turned to the Stanford faculty for support: David Mills, a criminal law professor at Stanford and a close family friend, is part of Bankman-Fried’s legal team. Bankman’s lawyer is former federal prosecutor Ronald White.Most Read  1 Vishal Bhardwaj thought Kaminey won’t work because nobody was getting along on set: ‘There was so much conflict…’   2 ‘SIM Swap fraud’: Delhi advocate receives 3 missed calls from unknown number, loses money from account   3 Ganapath box office collection day 2: Tiger Shroff-Kriti Sanon’s dead-on-arrival film fails to crack Rs 5 crore mark after two days   4 India versus New Zealand: Mohammed Shami has mastered the art of bowling out batsmen, like Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis did   5 Leo box office collection Day 4 early reports: Vijay’s film makes the best of first weekend  See More  Colleagues and family acquaintances are wrestling with what to say the next time they run into Bankman and Fried.

To my mind, no, there aren't that many left,"" said Jacob Sansbury, co-founder of retail investor services firm Pluto.Sansbury believes most over-leveraged miners, who tend to be large holders of bitcoin, have exited positions to pay off debts taken out in traditional money to fund their equipment and operations.Indeed bitcoin's recent calmness could be down to the fact that there are fewer coins to sell: the amount held on exchanges for trading stands at 1.97 million, Coinglass data shows, down steeply from 2.33 million at the start of the year.Major offloading has already taken place; November saw a 7-day realized loss of $10.16 billion in bitcoin investments as investors were forced to exit long-term positions, the fourth-largest loss on record by this measure, according to Glassnode data.The cryptocurrency has already dropped more than 60% in 2022 and set to see its first annual loss since 2018.Many remaining investors are placing their bitcoin into offline ""cold storage"" according to on-chain data, which should strengthen a floor price around $16,000, said Bob Ras, co-founder of Sologenic, an exchange and digital asset firm.""Barring any more surprises in the market, it's hard to imagine BTC going significantly lower,"" he added.Ras believes that if it wasn't for the high-profile collapse of crypto players FTX, Celsius and Terra this year, the price of bitcoin would be close to $25,000 now.But this is crypto, and more surprises could well be in store, with a number of potential selling triggers on the horizon.THE BEAR'S TALEFirst potential peril is the risk of more bitcoin miners being forced to sell their holdings to stay afloat, as mining becomes increasingly expensive.""Miners as a group start to become unprofitable under $20,000, so we're below (that) point,"" noted Ben McMillan, chief investment officer at IDX Digital Assets.CrytpoQuant's miner reserve indicator, which tracks the amount of bitcoin held in miners' wallets, has dropped by about 7,722 bitcoin since November.Market players also pointed to concerns about the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world's largest bitcoin fund with $10.9 billion in assets. Parent company Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis Trading, owes $575 million to Genesis' crypto lending arm, DCG's CEO told shareholders on Nov. 22.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's discount to its net asset value, is at an all-time low of 48% and shares have not traded at a premium since March 2021, Coinglass data showed.DCG last month said troubles at Genesis' lending business had no impact on DCG and its subsidiaries, while Grayscale maintained it was business as usual and its underlying assets were unaffected.""This could be the other shoe to drop,"" said McMillan, referring to the possibility of Grayscale running into financial trouble. ""That said, if bitcoin can hold the $15,000 line through the DCG workout, that would be a strong indicator going into 2023.A more hawkish than expected Federal Reserve at its final meeting of the year on Wednesday could further erode risk appetite and bitcoin's prospects, crypto watchers said.GETTING TECHNICALThe scenarios of bitcoin leaping to $30,000 or tumbling to $5,000 in 2023 were long-shot possibilities flagged by VanEck and Standard Chartered, respectively.When it comes to the technicals, several analysts pointed to indicators showing bitcoin may have found support between $16,000 and $16,800.The cryptocurrency could also run into resistance around the $17,490 level, said Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis at ADM Investor Services, cautioning that any long-term rally was likely to be challenging.""Anytime we see a rally, it's one step up and then two or three steps down,"" he said.Vetle Lunde, analyst at Arcane Research, said long-term bets could be appealing in the wake of the November turmoil.Nonetheless, uncertainty reigns.""Bear in mind that massive drawdowns tend to be followed by a long-lasting directionless market filled with apathy and unfathomable second-guessing,"" Lunde added.",2022-12-13

It’s cold – even colder in parts of the country this morning than yesterday - and in some places, it’s been snowing. These facts alone were enough to cause the UK to enter a familiar state of mild crisis. But while the real dangers of freezing temperatures were made appallingly clear by the dreadful news that three boys have died after they fell into an icy lake in Solihull on Sunday, that was a thankfully isolated incident. For the most part, the country slowed but did not come to a standstill.Many of the most serious issues that reared up as temperatures dropped – like the news that English hospitals are making emergency plans in case of power loss – were more to do with the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine than an innate inability to cope with bad weather. That didn’t stop everyone from thinking of themselves as heroic Arctic explorers for getting to the shops, though.If it is quite hard to remember that temperatures like this aren’t that unusual for December when you’re shivering through them, it is even harder to figure out how to prepare for them in advance. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Tera Allas, a former chief economist in the UK’s energy, transport and business departments, about how you go about making a country resilient in bad weather – and how you decide what’s worth protecting against. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesStrikes | Nurses’ strikes will go ahead this week after talks ended in deadlock, with the Royal College of Nursing condemning ministers’ “belligerence” for refusing to discuss pay. Meanwhile, rail workers begin a 48-hour strike on Tuesday after RMT union members rejected a pay offer. Here’s a calendar of the stoppages expected in December.Sam Bankman-Fried | Police in the Bahamas have arrested the founder of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the country’s attorney general said on Monday. The arrest came just 24 hours before Bankman-Fried was due to testify before US Congress.NHS | A “decade of neglect” has weakened the NHS to the point that it will not be able to tackle the 7 million-strong backlog of care, a government-commissioned report has concluded. The paper by the King’s Fund says years of denying funding to the health service has left it with too few staff.Energy | Researchers have reportedly made a breakthrough in the quest for a “near-limitless, safe, clean” source of energy by getting more out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in. Experts stressed that while the results would be an important proof of principle, the technology is not ready for practical applications.Tobacco | New Zealand has introduced a steadily rising smoking age to stop those aged 14 and under from ever being able to legally buy cigarettes in world-first legislation to outlaw smoking for the next generation. The new law will not restrict vape sales.Story continuesIn depth: ‘You need to consider what is optimal if something only happens once every 10 years’A special notice at Charing Cross station informs passengers that all Southeastern train services have been suspended due to the severe weather conditions in February 2022 in London. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images***How cold is it, actually?Well, look, pretty cold, but nothing to get your frozen knickers in a twist about. Sunday was the coldest night of 2022 in the UK, with temperatures of almost -16C recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, and -10C in Cumbria. It got even colder overnight in Braemar, reaching -17C. But the Met Office’s chief meteorologist Steve Willington says “these temperatures are not that unusual for this time of year”.That -17C measurement pales in comparison with last year’s -23C, also recorded at Braemar – the coldest temperature since 1995. So why are there a gazillion frozen cobwebs on my Instagram feed? One suggestion: Oli Claydon, also of the Met Office, tells the Guardian’s Damian Carrington that it may feel noticeably cold because of how abrupt a change it is from the third warmest autumn on record. We have fairly short memories for this stuff. Also, frozen cobwebs are nice!***Is this kind of weather connected to the climate crisis?No, writes Damian: “Cold conditions are expected in winter, with the weather then varying above and below the average from week to week.”That’s not evidence that the climate crisis isn’t real, though. In general, the expectation is that climate change will make extreme cold weather less likely in the UK, instead leading to “milder and wetter” winters, as this piece for The Conversation from last year sets out – noting that “no one under the age of 42 [now 43] has lived through what could be considered a historically cold winter season in central England.”***How severe is the impact?In general, severe enough to cause real disruption; maybe not severe enough to justify headlines about Britain “grinding to a halt”. Motorways and major roads closed in the south-east, Gwyn Topham writes, while rail services on Greater Anglia, Southeastern, and East Midlands Railway were among those affected. 300 flights were cancelled across the UK on Sunday and Monday. Power prices briefly hit record levels, while Jasper Jolly and Alex Lawson write that two coal-fired power stations were put on emergency standby, but were not ultimately needed.Policymakers look at the direct economic impact of bad weather – but they will set lost output against the likelihood that much of it will be caught up when conditions improve. Many public estimates have a finger-in-the-icy-wind quality, but for a rough sense of scale, a robust analysis by the Office for National Statistics in 2010 gave a central estimate of the daily cost of transport disruption from severe winter weather then at £280m.When figuring out wider impacts, Tera Allas, director of research and economics at McKinsey UK, says that it’s important to also “take into account the impact on health and life. So, for example, there will be a cost in carbon emissions. And if there are fatalities, there’s a wellbeing cost to friends and relatives.”One way to build those kinds of factors into analysis is to be guided by the costs of insurance against extreme weather events. You can also ask about the value of people’s time, Allas said: “Let’s say people lose 12 hours of their life sitting in traffic or something as a result of significant disruption – you can do what economists call ‘willingness to pay’ surveys: how much would you pay to avoid it? People are quite bad at predicting what they would pay, but it gives you a relative measure.”***How does the government think about preparing for the cold?Gritters, less common as council budgets are cut, spreading on the streets in December 2020 in Stourbridge, England. Photograph: Cameron Smith/Getty ImagesIt’s complicated – in part because you are trying to assess how much it’s worth investing to prevent something that might not happen often, and predicting long-term events is very hard to do precisely. “You do a cost-benefit analysis,” said Allas. “It’s almost like an insurance policy. So let’s take, for example, road conditions in the UK: having grit bins at the side of the road doesn’t cost much to have and maintain. Other mitigation options like snow ploughs or forcing everyone to use winter tyres will be more expensive. And you need to consider what is optimal if something only happens once every ten years, or once every hundred years.”That’s part of why you’ll occasionally see headlines about the UK’s abject failure to prepare for extremely severe hot or cold weather: it just doesn’t happen often enough, with high enough costs, to justify preparing as the Middle East or Scandinavia might. Still, there are legitimate reasons for concern about the quality of recent governmental planning. In October, a report by parliament’s Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy warned that, even as climate change bites, no single minister has responsibility for ensuring the resilience of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). The committee pointed to incidents like the death of three people in a 2020 train derailment caused by torrential rains in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire as the cost.Another factor: there’s no point in spending up front if you aren’t going to keep everything working. “There’s a scenario where you build up that capability, let’s say ploughs or de-icing machinery or whatever, but the event is so rare that you don’t practice using it. If you don’t take those maintenance costs into account, you spend a bunch of money without getting the benefit.”***Has austerity changed that analysis?One problem with the real world application of these methods: “People are not the rational robots that economists often used in their models. We all have biases,” said Allas. Central government economists will contribute to the “green book” guide for evaluating policy, but different departments and levels of government will inevitably have different costs, priorities and incentives. “And it’s really hard to compare different things in a unified metric, it can feel like apples and oranges.”If it’s hard enough to agree on what to prioritise, it gets harder still when resources are reduced, as they have been since 2010: it is very easy to find reports of councils economising, and even if we have a lot more gritting machines with hilarious names these days, that may not amuse people that much in, say, West Sussex, which had 38 gritters in 2008/9 and now has just 19.There’s also the question of whether tighter budgets reduce the ability to think long-term. This is not an area where Allas has seen detailed evidence, she cautioned. “But when people are under any kind of stress they are more prone to cognitive biases. If you’re running from a tiger, you don’t think long-term. You just want to get out of the tiger’s way.”What else we’ve been readingPolice officers try to detain a journalist at a protest in October in Port-au-Prince, in which another journalist, Vilsaint, was killed.

The US$40 billion implosion of the Terra-Luna stablecoin in May … [+6023 chars]",Forkast.news,"The cryptocurrency industry was already having an awful year well before the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange on Nov. 11. The US$40 billion implosion of the Terra-Luna stablecoin in May bankrupted several exposed lending platforms and kicked off waves of job cuts, with some in the industry saying the demise of FTX is also linked to the Terra debacle. Now, the layoffs and firings have picked up speed as another raft of businesses exposed to FTX are shutting shop or retrenching, and by some estimates tens of thousands of people have been thrown out of work.The question is has the industry hit bottom or will it get worse? Recruitment agencies add that salaries are falling as fast as the pace of job losses. A graphic of job cuts across the entire technology industry by online publisher Visual Capitalist, which includes many crypto companies, shows job losses were around 20,000 a month from May, dipping to 10,000 in September. But they surged to almost 60,000 in November when the likes of Meta, Amazon and Twitter slashed head counts.For some crypto exchanges, the job cuts are running as high as 40%.U.S.-based Kraken said this month it was laying off 30% of its workforce, or 1,100 people, to “adapt to current market conditions.” Singapore-based ByBit followed a few days later on Dec. 5, saying  it was cutting 30% of positions to “navigate the market slowdown.” ByBit had cut 30% of its staff in June. “It’s not good news at the moment,” said Neil Dundon, founder of Australia’s CryptoRecruit, a job agency specializing in cryptocurrency positions.“We seem to be either at the bottom of the cycle or heading towards the bottom. We’re seeing 30 – 40% staff reductions across most crypto companies.” Many businesses expanded too quickly during the heady period of the bull run of 2021, and are now having to adjust quickly as market fortunes have reversed, Dundon told Forkast in an interview.Salaries, too“I’m actually, frankly, pretty surprised a lot of these companies have even held on to staff this long,” he said, “because there’s just very, very, very little liquidity and there’s just been disaster after disaster in the crypto markets over the last six months.” He added that the focus on job losses can miss the fact that salaries are falling at an equal pace, so those lucky to find other jobs in the industry will need to lower compensation expectations, he said. As Dundon points out, the job losses are hitting across the board because liquidity evaporated, regardless of whether a company had any exposure to FTX.That was a point made by Australia-based cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx Pty Ltd, which cut 40% of its staff, or about 90 positions, on Dec. 5.Swyftx co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Harper said the company had no direct exposure to FTX, but was not immune to the widespread fallout from its bankruptcy and that the cuts were to prepare for the worst. “That’s the key thing about crypto, it’s a marathon, it’s not a sprint,” said Mark Hiriart, Head of SaaS (software as a service) Distribution at Hong Kong-based digital asset platform OSL. “When you see firms trimming workforces, which is always unfortunate, I think it’s prudent for those firms to be doing so because ultimately they want to survive and be around for the next cycle and the next run.”Hiriart added that while he doesn’t think any sector within the industry is insulated from the slump, it does also bring with it new opportunities.Big playersWhile cryptocurrency has largely been a retail-driven phenomenon, the shake-up in the market this year doesn’t seem to have deterred institutional interest in the underlying blockchain technology, Hiriart saidThis takes the form of tokenization of assets, including the potential in carbon credits and on to stablecoins. “You might see some retail contraction, but you’re [also] seeing institutional expansion simultaneously under the hood, which is, I think, pretty encouraging,” he said.Despite the institutional interest, however, Hiriart says the industry’s reputation has suffered. The percentage of Americans with a positive view of crypto fell to 8% in November, down from 19% in March, according to a survey of 800 people conducted by CNBC in late November.“Yes, sentiment definitely took a hit,” he said. “But I also think in a weird sort of way, it’s kind of needed… The sooner these bad actors are removed from the industry — if they are up to no good — it’s better for us all in the long term,” said Hiriart.Dundon said job prospects won’t improve until the market does, and he doesn’t see that happening until interest rates come back down and broader concerns about economies and growth start to ease.“My guess is between March second quarter next year we should start to see that uptick,” he said, adding that crypto companies are much more nimble in hiring so openings should pick up quickly once the market rebounds.Engineer shortage?What might slow a crypto job market recovery is a shortage of technical staff and engineers in the blockchain talent pool, according to an August report by Seychelles-based crypto exchange OKX and professional social media platform LinkedIn.The report, entitled ‘Global Blockchain Industry Talent Insights — Focus on Web 3.0.’, found that job demand was shifting to engineers from finance openings and that such technical staff were short in supply.Kani Chen, Director of the Crypto-Fintech Lab at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, agreed that demand was outstripping supply.“We very often get contacts from industry requiring or requesting talents in blockchain areas,” said Chen in an interview with Forkast, “[and] within the university sometimes it is still difficult to find blockchain developers.”In the meantime, it does seem to be an employer’s market. “If a company’s got funds and they can see themselves through this bear market, there’s a great opportunity,” Dundon said. “The silver lining is that opportunity to capture some fantastic talent out there.”Perhaps seeing the opportunity, Japan’s Hitachi Ltd. said earlier this month it plans to hire about 30,000 people over the next three years for what it called the field of “digital transformation.”",2022-12-13

Some have called this the ""worry discount,"" but whatever you call it, markets seem to overcompensate investors for the very real but mostly predictable and quantifiable risks that exist in credit markets. Making matters worse is the fact that the average investor has little appreciation that headline ""default"" estimates are always a multiple of what actual credit losses turn out to be, after typical recoveries of 50, 60 or 70% of principal on defaulted debt are taken into account. Credit risks are, by definition, less than the risks that exist in equity markets, given how credit (e.g. loans, bonds, etc.) sits above equity on corporate balance sheets and has to be repaid or else the equity below it is worthless. So an investor who owns equity in mid-cap or small-cap stocks, whether they realize it or not, is also taking the risk on all the high-yield bonds and loans on the balance sheets of those same companies; debt that has to be serviced and repaid if the equity below it has any chance of surviving, let alone increasing in value. It is not surprising that the media and various commentators tend to go overboard pointing out the risks - both real and exaggerated - that exist in the corporate credit markets. Having been both a banker, credit executive and also a financial journalist over my multi-decade career, I know from experience what sells magazines and newspapers, and in our more recent electronic publishing era, what generates clicks on on-line sites (like Seeking Alpha). ""Chicken Little"" articles with someone yelling ""the sky is falling"" have always been the model for getting journalistic attention, and that continues today. So articles hyping how bad things are going to get, whether in the economy generally or in specific markets, will always get more attention from both editors and readers than more sober articles that say: ""Yes, there are issues to be addressed and things may get ugly, but overall the economy (or Company X) will manage to muddle through."" Stories like that are probably more accurate, but are not nearly as exciting or interesting....and surely don't sell as many subscriptions. The ""Worry Discount"" - A Real Life Market Example Here is a description of the capital structure of a new collateralized loan obligation (""CLO"") just being launched. It shows all the different debt tranches that will be used to fund the CLO's investment in a pool of senior secured corporate loans. (For background on CLOs, which are ""virtual banks,"" check out this article.) Notice the top tranches, which get paid first before the lower-rated debt tranches (and all of which get paid before the equity gets anything), are rated AAA through A, and even those highly rated and ""super safe"" issues are yielding rates that would normally make an investment grade investor's mouth water. SB Look at the triple-A rated tranche: The base rate (SOFR or ""secured overnight financing rate"") is currently 3.8%, plus a spread of 235 basis points, for an all-in coupon of 6.15%. That's a heck of a return on a triple-A credit, and it may understate the actual return if the investor is able to purchase it at a discount (which may be the case, although not always). As you move further down the liability stack, discounts become more typical. Let's consider the single-A tranche. Single-As are extremely good credits, with defaults that are few and far between. The base rate SOFR at 3.8%, plus a spread of 405 basis points, equals a coupon of 7.85%, which is what high yield bonds were paying not that long ago. And the tranche rated BBB- pays SOFR plus 596, which is 3.8% plus 5.96%, or 9.76%, a pretty mouth-watering yield for what is still an investment grade credit. (And that's before the benefit of any upfront discount.) But it's down in the double-B rated sector where the real fun begins; and that's the arena that a number of the funds we invest in are actively engaged in, like Eagle Point Income (EIC), as well as XAI Octagon Floating Rate (XFLT), and Ares Dynamic Allocation Fund (ARDC). Note how the spread over the SOFR base rate has jumped up to 870 basis points. That means a coupon of 3.8% plus 8.7%, or a total of 12.5%. Sources closer to the CLO market tell me it would not be unusual for CLO sponsors to have to discount significantly the lower tranche debt, as they do the equity, in order to place it initially with investors. We know from EIC's October month-end report that double-B rated debt carried on its books at that time was marked to market at a 19% discount. If we assume a more modest discount of 8% on newly issued double-B CLO debt, that would still add another 8% capital gain to be earned when the debt matures at par, typically about 5 years later. So if we amortize that 8% discount over 5 years, that adds another 1.6% to the yield, bringing it up to 14.1%. But there's more. Since we bought at a discount and only paid 92 cents on the dollar to buy the asset, rather than par of 100, the yield on the actual amount of our investment is 14.1% divided by 0.92, or 15.3%. Obviously, there are assumptions in here that may vary a bit from deal to deal, but this gives us an idea of how ""rich"" the high-yield credit market, especially the more specialized sub-sector of CLO debt, has become as markets have tightened in anticipation of an economic downturn and the increased credit defaults that are expected. Why does CLO debt pay a premium over normal corporate debt of the same rating? Nobody can prove it, but my own theory is that CLOs are perceived by some traditional, mainstream investors to be more complicated than ordinary corporate structures. So the securities CLOs issue, both debt and equity, end up paying a ""complexity premium"" as a result. It doesn't mean they are riskier than equivalently rated corporate debt. But if the complexity discourages some institutional investors from buying them (perhaps because their investment charters don't include them, or they don't want to have to explain more complex instruments to less technically sophisticated oversight committees or boards of directors, etc.), that essentially ""shifts the demand curve"" as the economists say, and the lower demand could mean higher clearing prices on the securities they issue. Whatever the reason, investors who are willing to climb the learning curve on CLOs and other higher-yielding securities reap the advantages, as we try to do in our model Income FactoryÂ® portfolios. I recognize that funds that invest in CLO debt and equity may not be everyone's cup of tea, which is why I list them as ""more aggressive options"" in our list of investment choices.

The typosquatted Python packages all impersonate the popular requests library: dequests, fequests, gequests, rdquests, reauests, reduests, reeuests, reqhests, reqkests, requesfs, requesta, requeste, requestw, requfsts, resuests, rewuests, rfquests, rrquests, rwquests, telnservrr, and tequests. According to Phylum, the rogue packages embed source code that retrieves a Golang-based ransomware binary from a remote server depending on the victim's operating system and microarchitecture.  Successful execution causes the victim's desktop background to be changed to an actor-controlled image that claims to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It's also designed to encrypt files and demand a $100 ransom in cryptocurrency. In a sign that the attack is not limited to PyPI, the adversary has been spotted publishing five different modules in npm: discordallintsbot, discordselfbot16, discord-all-intents-bot, discors.jd, and telnservrr.  ""The attacker has also published several npm packages that behave in a similar manner,"" Phylum CTO Louis Lang said, adding each of the libraries contain the JavaScript equivalent of the same code to deploy the ransomware. The findings come as ReversingLabs uncovered a tranche of 10 additional PyPI packages pushing modified versions of the W4SP Stealer malware as part of an ongoing supply chain attack aimed at software developers that's believed to have started around September 25, 2022. That's not all. Earlier this month, Israel-based software supply chain security firm Legit Security demonstrated a new attack technique against a Rust repository (""rust-lang"") that abuses GitHub Actions to poison legitimate artifacts. Build artifacts are the files created by the build process, such as distribution packages, WAR files, logs, and reports. By replacing the actual modules with trojanized versions, an actor could steal sensitive information or deliver additional payloads to all its downstream users.  ""The vulnerability was found in a workflow called 'ci.yml' which is responsible for building and testing the repository's code,"" Legit Security researcher Noam Dotan said in a technical write-up.  By exploiting this weakness, an attacker could trick the GitHub workflow into executing a malware-laced artifact, effectively making it possible to tamper with repository branches, pull requests, issues, and releases. The maintainers of the Rust programming language addressed the issue on September 26, 2022, following responsible disclosure on September 15, 2022.   Found this article interesting?

However, the crash due to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX completely reversed the trend as these holders quickly started shedding off their holdings instead. This decline in the indicator suggests that the crash made even these resolute holders panic and sell off their coins. But in the last few weeks, tides have once again seemed to have shifted. As the market has traded sideways, the LTH supply has observed a constant rise, implying that these investors are back at accumulating.

The indictment says that, starting in 2019, Bankman-Fried intentionally devised “a scheme and artifice to defraud” FTX's customers and investors, diverting their money to pay expenses and debts at his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations.  Bankman-Fried was arrested on Monday in the Bahamas, which said it would “promptly” extradite him to the US once a formal request is made.The US government charged him with eight criminal violations, ranging from wire fraud to money laundering, conspiracy to commit fraud, and making illegal campaign contributions.A lawyer for Bankman-Fried, Mark S. Cohen, said on Tuesday he is “reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options"".The indictment comes on top of civil charges announced earlier in the day by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It also alleged that Bankman-Fried defrauded investors and illegally used their money to buy real estate on behalf of himself and family.Bitcoin plunges to a 2-year low as FTX collapse contaminates industryRise and fall of a crypto kingThe charges mark a stunning fall from grace for the 30-year-old entrepreneur widely known by his initials SBF, who rode a boom in Bitcoin and other digital assets until FTX's collapse last month.The exchange, launched in 2019 and based in the Bahamas, filed for bankruptcy on November 11 when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run. Since FTX collapsed, Bankman-Fried has been holed up in his Bahamian luxury compound in Nassau. He has a right to contest his extradition, which could delay but probably not stop his transfer to the US.  Bankman-Fried was one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper and a prominent personality in Washington, donating millions toward mostly left-leaning political causes and Democratic political campaigns. Meanwhile, FTX grew to become the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.Binance is ‘in it for the long game’ when it comes to Europe and doesn’t fear the crypto crash'House of cards built on deception'That all unravelled quickly last month, when reports called into question the strength of FTX’s balance sheet.Customers moved to withdraw billions of dollars, but FTX could not meet all the requests because it apparently had used its customers’ deposits to fund investments at Bankman-Fried’s trading arm, Alameda Research.“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.The SEC complaint alleges that Bankman-Fried raised more than $1.8 billion (€1.7 billion) from equity investors since May 2019 by promoting FTX as a safe, responsible platform for trading crypto assets. Instead, the complaint says, Bankman-Fried diverted customers' funds to Alameda Research without telling them.""He then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses,"" the complaint reads. ""None of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers”.Bankman-Fried said recently that he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and said he believes his millions of angry customers will eventually be made whole.",2022-12-13

The 30-year-old FTX founder was nabbed by authorities in the Bahamas Monday night after criminal charges were filed against him by US prosecutors. But Bankman-Fried’s sudden arrest means the shaggy-haired former billionaire will be exempt from testifying at Tuesday’s House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) was among those to criticize the timing of his detainment, tweeting that House Republicans had been “ready to grill him six ways to Sunday” on the failure of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. “Tomorrow, Sam Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee … Now breaking tonight, SBF was just arrested!” Zeldin wrote.    4  Many are questioning why Sam Bankman-Fried was nabbed by authorities in the Bahamas the night before he was to testify before Congress.GMA   4  Sam Bankman-Fried testified during the House Financial Services Committee hearing on Dec. 8, 2021.CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images “Why not allow him to 1st testify tomorrow and answer our many questions?” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, echoed those concerns, saying she was “disappointed” that the arrest happened prior to Bankman-Fried’s testimony. “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,” Waters said in a statement. “The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.” But lawmakers weren’t the only ones questioning the decision.   4  Bankman-Fried has been under investigation since FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11.Christopher Sadowski Abe Hamadeh, a former prosecutor and GOP nominee for Arizona attorney general, said the decision to arrest Bankman-Fried on the eve of his testimony didn’t make sense tactically.  “As a former prosecutor, this doesn’t make much sense. You want him to talk…,” Hamadeh tweeted.  Others appeared to suggest Bankman-Fried had allegedly been spared because of his history of donating millions of dollars to Democratic political campaigns and mostly left-leaning political causes. “We ALL know the real reason why mega-Democrat donor Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested today…so he wouldn’t have to testify in front of Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee tomorrow,” Javon A. Price, of the America First Policy Institute, tweeted.  Bankman-Fried has been under investigation by the Justice Department ever since FTX imploded and filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11 after traders rushed to withdraw $6 billion from the platform in just three days.   4  The luxury Bahamas property where Bankman-Fried was staying.  Albany Bahamas The former billionaire, who resigned as FTX’s CEO the day of the bankruptcy filing, was planning to lash out at his former lawyers — Sullivan and Cromwell — and new FTX CEO John Ray during the congressional hearing. According to a draft copy of his testimony obtained by Reuters, Bankman-Fried had planned to say he was pressured by the lawyers to nominate Ray as CEO in the wake of the sudden exodus of customer funds.  He changed his mind 10 minutes after receiving an offer of billions of dollars of fresh funding, but claims he was told it was too late to remove Ray.         see also             Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried busted in Bahamas, charged with defrauding investors out of $1.8B       Bankman-Fried has repeatedly denied personal responsibility for the platform’s collapse and distanced himself from fraud accusations, insisting he “didn’t ever try to commit fraud.” He was planning to repeat those claims in his testimony, saying: “I would like to start by formally stating, under oath: I f–ked up.” Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the indictment against Bankman-Fried would be unsealed Tuesday. The charges include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering, the New York Times reported, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Federal prosecutors have reportedly been scrutinizing how FTX handled customer funds and the alleged transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars from the US to the Bahamas around the time of the bankruptcy filing.  They were also said to be probing whether Bankman-Fried manipulated crypto markets by orchestrating trades that led to the collapse of the TerraUSD cryptocurrency earlier this year.

He does not recommend that Bitcoin enthusiasts take the layer-2 payments network, the LN, into their own hands as he did. “The use is just to show that it is possible and you can do stuff like that.” He added that most people carry cards, it’s just his hand has the wow factor: “It’s funny if you are doing a presentation as I sometimes do presentations about payments and talk to people that are working in banks, and they make ‘Big Eyes’ if they see that [my hand].

It’s not the same security as the bolt card–you can only do LNURL withdraw; it’s not safe.” Plus, if you make a mistake during the implantation process, it’s not a good idea to take the chip in and out of the body. It could cause harm or infection, F418 explained, so it’s best to get it the right the first time.In brief, the NFC chip works identically implanted in F418’s hand, enabling him to make LN payments without the need for a physical device such as a smartphone or card. He can simply hold his hand near a compatible NFC reader to initiate a payment. It’s arguably the most convenient Bitcoin payment, allowing for quick and easy transactions without the need for any additional equipment.NFC, or Near Field Communication technology use cases have bubbled up in the Bitcoin world. Indeed, NFC payments over the LN have surged in popularity since the introduction of the Bolt Card, first trialed over lunch on the Isle of Man, and now available in “Bitcoin Country,” or El Salvador. F148 shows the tiny raised insert of the chip to Cointelegraph during a call.

It allows for near-instant and near-free transactions by enabling users to make multiple payments without having to wait for the transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain. In essence, the LN creates a network of payment channels between users, allowing them to transact directly without the need for each transaction to be recorded on the blockchain.Related: Subway accepts Bitcoin, so users can get a sandwich on the Lightning NetworkAs for F418, he continues to tinker with Bitcoin and, increasingly, the Lightning Network.

According to Dietrich Domanski, the outgoing secretary-general of the FSB, recent events have highlighted that it’s “urgent to address risks” within the space. He explained: “Many crypto market participants argue that authorities are hostile to innovation. I would say so far, authorities have been fairly accommodating.”Domanski also noted that the goal of creating recommendations for crypto regulation will be to hold crypto projects “to the same standards as banks” if they are giving similar services as banks. With the recent collapses of major cryptocurrency projects like Terraform Labs and FTX exchange, global policymakers have received criticisms about allowing FTX to expand before blowing up. According to the FSB official, such rules and standards would have prevented events like the Terra and FTX collapse since they wouldn’t have met the “criteria for sound governance.” In the months ahead, the FSB is planning to create a timeline for global regulators to implement the initial recommendations. After providing recommendations, rules agreed upon at the FSB can be put into law by various national and regulators.Related: Industry execs voice confidence in DeFi adoption despite security flawsMeanwhile, the former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, was recently arrested by the Royal Bahamas police and is set to be extradited to the United States. The arrest follows a formal notification by the U.S. government that it has filed criminal charges against Bankman-Fried. Charges include wire and securities fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud. Hours before the arrest, Bankman-Fried denied that he was part of a “Wirefraud” chat group that was allegedly made up of FTX executives. The group was allegedly used to exchange information about FTX and Alameda Research’s operations.  ",2022-12-13

Battered bitcoin's been unresponsive since being clobbered by the FTX collapse, taking in a deep ragged breath before plunging towards the depths of $5,000. Place your bets, spin the wheel. The world's dominant cryptocurrency has certainly been uncharacteristically muted over the past two weeks, treading water between about $15,770 and $17,350 in the eerie wake of the FTX-induced market mini-crash in November. What happens next is anyone's guess. ""The question we need to be asking ourselves now is: Are there any sellers left in this market? To my mind, no, there aren't that many left,"" said Jacob Sansbury, co-founder of retail investor services firm Pluto. Sansbury believes most over-leveraged miners, who tend to be large holders of bitcoin, have exited positions to pay off debts taken out in traditional money to fund their equipment and operations. Indeed bitcoin's recent calmness could be down to the fact that there are fewer coins to sell: the amount held on exchanges for trading stands at 1.97 million, Coinglass data shows, down steeply from 2.33 million at the start of the year. Major offloading has already taken place; November saw a 7-day realized loss of $10.16 billion in bitcoin investments as investors were forced to exit long-term positions, the fourth-largest loss on record by this measure, according to Glassnode data. The cryptocurrency has already dropped more than 60% in 2022 and set to see its first annual loss since 2018. Many remaining investors are placing their bitcoin into offline ""cold storage"" according to on-chain data, which should strengthen a floor price around $16,000, said Bob Ras, co-founder of Sologenic, an exchange and digital asset firm. ""Barring any more surprises in the market, it's hard to imagine BTC going significantly lower,"" he added. Ras believes that if it wasn't for the high-profile collapse of crypto players FTX, Celsius and Terra this year, the price of bitcoin would be close to $25,000 now. But this is crypto, and more surprises could well be in store, with a number of potential selling triggers on the horizon. THE BEAR'S TALE First potential peril is the risk of more bitcoin miners being forced to sell their holdings to stay afloat, as mining becomes increasingly expensive. ""Miners as a group start to become unprofitable under $20,000, so we're below (that) point,"" noted Ben McMillan, chief investment officer at IDX Digital Assets. CrytpoQuant's miner reserve indicator, which tracks the amount of bitcoin held in miners' wallets, has dropped by about 7,722 bitcoin since November. Market players also pointed to concerns about the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, GBTC.PK the world's largest bitcoin fund with $10.9 billion in assets. Parent company Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis Trading, owes $575 million to Genesis' crypto lending arm, DCG's CEO told shareholders on Nov. 22. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's discount to its net asset value, is at an all-time low of 48% and shares have not traded at a premium since March 2021, Coinglass data showed. DCG last month said troubles at Genesis' lending business had no impact on DCG and its subsidiaries, while Grayscale maintained it was business as usual and its underlying assets were unaffected. ""This could be the other shoe to drop,"" said McMillan, referring to the possibility of Grayscale running into financial trouble. ""That said, if bitcoin can hold the $15,000 line through the DCG workout, that would be a strong indicator going into 2023. A more hawkish than expected Federal Reserve at its final meeting of the year on Wednesday could further erode risk appetite and bitcoin's prospects, crypto watchers said. GETTING TECHNICAL The scenarios of bitcoin leaping to $30,000 or tumbling to $5,000 in 2023 were long-shot possibilities flagged by VanEck and Standard Chartered, respectively. When it comes to the technicals, several analysts pointed to indicators showing bitcoin may have found support between $16,000 and $16,800. The cryptocurrency could also run into resistance around the $17,490 level, said Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis at ADM Investor Services, cautioning that any long-term rally was likely to be challenging. ""Anytime we see a rally, it's one step up and then two or three steps down,"" he said.

This included all the Black Swan instances that occurred in 2020. This is because those incidents have highlighted cracks or vulnerabilities in many crypto projects.  Read Litecoin’s [LTC] Price Prediction 2023-24  One common characteristic highlighting vulnerability was centralized operations. The Litecoin Foundation’s managing director, Alan Austin, released an update confirming that they have maintained a decentralized approach with their operations. This included funding its operations using donations and volunteers rather than sitting on a fat stack of cash.       Unlike many companies in the crypto space, @LTCFoundation is not sitting on piles of money. In fact, far from it. The reason for this is that unlike many projects and their respective tokens, Litecoin was fairly launched and did not have a premine or ICO to give founders and 👇 — Alan Austin (@alangaustin) December 11, 2022  Austin also noted that one decision of the Litecoin Foundation was community-based. In the past, there have been instances where entire crypto organizations crumbled due to centralized or individual decisions. Additionally, Litecoin was also undertaking steps to ensure easier access. For example, the network has so far expanded its ATM accessibility by as much as 7.8% in the last 12 months.

In other words, the network was making gradual slides that would aid in adoption. Litecoin price action recap Last week, there was a higher price to RSI divergence setup observed in Litecoin, a pattern that is often associated with a bearish outlook. Fast forward to 12 December, and LTC tanked by over 9% from the $84.97 weekly high to its $74.98. Source: TradingView Litecoin’s Money Flow Index (MFI) registered outflows last week because of the sell pressure. However, this week kicked off with a manifestation of incoming buy pressure. If this trend continued, then LTC’s downside might be limited. Evaluating the potential for a bullish recovery Litecoin’s ability to bounce back from its current range would depend on whether it could drum up enough buying pressure at the time of writing. Most of the sell pressure was coming from addresses holding between 10,000 – one million coins. Whales in the 1,000 – 10,000 LTC bracket and those holding over one million coins were contributing to the buy pressure at the time of writing. The lack of uniformity among the top whales in terms of buy and sell pressure also made it difficult to establish whether the trend would continue or pivot. Nevertheless, the current weighted sentiment remained bullish. Source: Santiment The above analysis revealed that demand or buying pressure was returning at press time, even though there was still some sell pressure. Regardless, LTC’s performance in the coming week will largely depend on the overall state of the crypto market.

Trend Micro security researchers discovered the threat last month. Like earlier, similar versions of the miner that also target Linux operating systems, the code kills competing malware and resources that affect cryptocurrency mining performance. The newer malware then establishes persistence ""by altering /etc/crontab file, a UNIX task scheduler that, in this case, downloads itself every 10 minutes from Pastebin,"" wrote Trend Micro researchers David Fiser and Alfredo Oliveira.        After that, it downloads an XMRig miner, a configuration file, another payload that continually kills competing malware, and the Chaos RAT (remote access tool), which is written in Go and has a ton of capabilities including restarting and shutting down the victim's machine.                 Additionally, the open source tool can perform reverse shell on the infected system, take screenshots of the victim's device, collect info on the operating system, and download, upload or even delete files. ""An interesting trait of the malware family we intercepted is that the address and access token are passed as compilation flags and hardcoded inside the RAT client, replacing any data inside variables from the main code,"" the researchers wrote.        They also noted that the main server, used for downloading payloads, appears to be in Russia, while the Chaos RAT connects to another command-and-control server believed to be in Hong Kong.

According to the Trend Micro researchers, other cybercriminals have used this same hosting service for their attacks on cloud infrastructure, containers and Linux servers. ""On the surface, the incorporation of a RAT into the infection routine of a cryptocurrency mining malware might seem relatively minor,"" Fiser and Oliveira said.  ""However, given the tool's array of functions and the fact that this evolution shows that cloud-based threat actors are still evolving their campaigns, it is important that both organizations and individuals stay extra vigilant when it comes to security,"" they continued. ®  Get our Tech Resources     ",2022-12-13

And, as most of these countries do, it intends to tighten the guidelines for the industry and focus on investor protection. According to the report from the Bangkok Post published on Dec. 13, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing more stringent regulations on digital assets “to mirror the global market.” To justify such a decision, the SEC representatives reportedly nodded on the failures of FTX, Three Arrows Capital, the TerraUSD, Celsius Network and the local exchange, Zipmex. The regulators also raised their concern with the recent trends in crypto advertising, notably the use of “finfluencers” to deliver the message, which could have misled the audience into investment risks. They deemed the digital asset industry to be “vulnerable” and in need of oversight. The SEC highlighted investor protection, control over crypto advertising, prevention of conflicts of interest and cybersecurity as major areas to focus its efforts on. It has set up a working committee, combined with both officials and private stakeholders, to assess and prepare the relevant amendments to existing regulations. Related: Crypto exchange Bitkub targeted by Thai SEC with wash trading claimsInterestingly, it’s not the first time the Thai SEC acted on crypto advertising standards. It has already obliged the market players to have clear investment warnings to consumers back in September. The same month the SEC opened a public hearing on its initiative to prohibit crypto platforms from providing or supporting digital asset depository services. The possible ban of any staking and lending services is supposed to protect traders and the general public. In Thailand, the wave of crypto businesses’ bankruptcies stroke one of the largest local platforms, Zipmex. In July, the company suspended withdrawals, citing a “combination of circumstances beyond [its] control.” The SEC accused Zipmex and its co-founder Akalarp Yimwilai of non-compliance with local laws and referred the matter to the police.As Zipmex representative specified to Cointelegraph, the company still operates and is insulated from bankruptcy process at least until the end of 2023:""Currently, we are under Moratorium as we filed for Bankruptcy Protection in which the Singapore Court has granted us an extension of Moratorium until 2 December 2023.”",2022-12-13

The golden cross t… [+4622 chars]",Cointelegraph,"A golden cross pattern on the charts excites crypto traders for its promises of profitable opportunities ahead, largely due to its impressive success rate in traditional markets. The golden cross tends to precede sustained uptrends in contrast with the bearish death cross pattern. For instance, since 1970, the S&amp;P 500 has been returning about 15% gains on average in less than a year after a golden cross’ occurrence.The golden cross’ record in the benchmark crypto asset Bitcoin (BTC) is similarly impressive. Notably, the indicator has appeared seven times on Bitcoin daily charts since 2010, out of which five have led to massive bull runs.What is a golden cross pattern?Before discussing the golden cross, let’s discuss its core component known as moving averages (MAs).A moving average records the average change in an asset’s price over a specific period. Mathematically, they are measured after adding a set of prices (recorded in a fixed timeframe such as hourly, four-hour, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) — and by dividing the sum by the number of prices in the set.Moving average examplesTraditionally, golden cross watchers focus on two specific moving averages: the 50-day moving average, which becomes the short-term MA, and the 200-day MA as the long-term moving average.A golden cross pattern forms when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA. In other words, the pattern shows that buying interest in a particular market has risen over the previous 50 days compared to the previous 200 days.Golden cross illustrationHow does a golden cross work?Golden crosses typically precede significant price rallies across traditional and crypto markets, a reason why traders perceive them as buy signals.BTC/USD daily price chart featuring March 2020 golden cross and a ~750% rally afterward. Source: TradingViewBut there have been cases where golden crosses have been followed by fake breakouts. Therefore, one should consider the golden cross pattern alongside other technical indicators before making a decision.For starters, traders can employ the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that determines an asset’s overbought and oversold conditions, to predict potential price pullbacks. Related: What is a Doji candle pattern and how to trade with it?In February 2020, this strategy may have helped many traders avoid deeper losses. Let’s see why. On Feb. 1, 2020, Bitcoin’s 50- and 200-day MA formed a golden cross when it traded for around $9,500. A modest euphoria followed, and the price moved to as high as $10,500 in the next two weeks. The period also saw Bitcoin’s daily RSI rise above its overbought threshold of 70.BTC/USD daily price chart with fake golden cross breakout. Source: TradingViewBitcoin’s overbought conditions resulted in a decline toward its 50- and 200-day MA (the $8,500-$9,200 range). But its price eventually collapsed below $4,000 entering March, in line with a global market meltdown led by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.The case study explains that golden crosses are not 100% accurate in predicting future trends. Instead, they could merely assist traders and analysts by employing momentum indicators as well as fundamentals to forecast price actions in the short and long term. These momentum indicators could include Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Stochastic RSI, Rate of Change (ROC), Average Directional Index (ADI), and others.In other words, traders are advised not to buy too early into a golden cross formation. Instead, they could wait for the price to consolidate sideways or lower and find short-term support before deciding to enter a trade.It’s possible to also alter the definition of a golden cross in volatile market conditions by changing moving averages. For instance, using the 20-period MA for the short-term MA and the 50-period MA for t long-term MA. The 20-50-day MA combination has historically helped traders determine short-term crypto market trends, as shown below in the March 2020-November 2021 bull run.BTC/USD daily price chart featuring 20-50 MA crossovers. Source: TradingViewGolden crosses don’t mean guaranteed gainsWhile golden crosses frequently do indeed appear before major price rallies in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, the risk of bulls falling into a trap remains. Ultimately, traders should be cautious with crossover signals, as blindly following them might result in losses. As discussed above, false signals can occur and it’s important to confirm any golden cross with additional technical indicators before making any trades.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Dynamics and Demographics of the U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use, a report released on 13 December show that this percentage has significantly increased since it was only 3% just before 2020. The most recent information from JPMorgan was derived from an examination of checking account transfers from a sample of more than five million clients. It was discovered that between 2020 and 2022, 600,000 clients in this sample group made a cash transfer to a cryptocurrency account. Crypto bull is what drove most of them The survey also discovered that Bitcoin owners frequently made their initial purchases during periods of price increases. During this period, money is often sent into cryptocurrency exchange accounts at a far higher rate than it is removed. In other words, at this time the majority of people held onto their cryptocurrency.      According to JPMorgan, this changed in early 2022 when cryptocurrency values dropped. Cash flows into cryptocurrency exchanges in recent months have barely outpaced cash transfers out of them. The report also stated that the bulk of respondents invested less than one month’s worth of income in cryptocurrencies, with the median amount transferred totaling just $620. That’s probably for the best, as last year’s spike in crypto prices coincided with a surge in transfers. The Institute discovered that the typical transfer took place while the price of Bitcoin was around $43,900. Currently, the price of one Bitcoin is about $17,000. According to JPMorgan, this is due to both falling cryptocurrency prices and a larger pattern of the savings rate in the U.S. plummeting since the pandemic. They stated, “We view the rise and fall of crypto use since the onset of COVID as consistent with the joint relationship between retail flows and market prices seen in prior research. Additionally, the trend in crypto flows also tracks dynamics of household savings, which spiked to historic highs early in the pandemic but has begun to reverse.” And what is the majority age group of buyers? The survey analyzed whether some demographic groups are more likely to purchase cryptocurrency. It was discovered that younger people acquire substantially more cryptocurrency than older people and that men of all ages buy significantly more than women.  For instance, the study discovered that more than 25% of millennial men have purchased cryptocurrency, compared to only 12% of millennial women and 5% of male baby boomers. In 2022, the cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp decline. While Ether has dropped from $3,521 in April to $1,273 at the time of writing, Bitcoin has dropped from a 2022 high of $47,459 in March to $17,208, at press time. Industry shocks like the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin losing its peg in May and the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November are to be blamed for the current decline in the cryptocurrency market.

This involves swapping one cryptocurrency for another without the need for fiat currency.Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, tweeted that the exchange is seeing an increase in withdrawals of USDC, a cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin because it is pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar.USDC is used by investors to trade in and out of different cryptocurrencies without the need to move money back into U.S. dollars. If traders are withdrawing USDC from Binance, it could be to move it onto another platform.Zhao said that any transfers into USDC from the stablecoin known as PAX, as well as Binance's own token BUSD, require routing through a bank based in New York which is not yet open. The suggestion from Zhao is that users are looking to convert their PAX and BUSD into USDC in order to withdraw their funds from Binance.A token swap could be a way for Binance to get more USDC quickly while the banks are closed in order to resume withdrawals for customers.Zhao said users could still withdraw other stablecoins including BUSD and tether. Deposits are not affected, he said.Binance's own token called BNB was trading down about 5% on Tuesday morning, according to data from CoinGecko.It's not normally good news when a crypto firm has to pause withdrawals. In the summer, crypto firms including lender Celsius had to pause withdrawals before ultimately filing for bankruptcy. There is no indication of any such trouble for Binance.In the past 24 hours, Binance has seen $1.6 billion of outflows from its platform, according to a tweet from crypto data company Nansen published early Tuesday. Binance has more than $60 billion of assets on its platform, Nansen said. The collapse of FTX and arrest of its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has crypto investors on edge with fears of further contagion across the industry.Binance has been in the spotlight since its decision to sell its stake in FTX's self-issued FTT digital tokens, which preceded the failure of the rival exchange.Investors have called for more transparency from Binance's business. Last month, the company issued a proof of reserve in which it claims to have a reserve ratio of 101%. That means it has enough assets to cover customer deposits. But critics have said that the proof of reserves have not gone far enough to give assurances of Binance's collateral. Mazars, the auditing firm Binance used for its proof of reserves, said in its five-page report that the company does ""not express an opinion or an assurance conclusion.""Investors are also keeping tabs on a report from Reuters that U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a criminal investigation into Binance. Reuters, citing four people familiar with the matter, reported that the investigation is focused on Binance's compliance with anti-money laundering laws. Binance responded saying: ""Reuters has it wrong again.""""We don't have any insight into the inner workings of the US Justice Department, nor would it be appropriate for us to comment if we did,"" the company said in a tweet on Monday.",2022-12-13

However, due to the costs of creating and maintaining blockchain-powered applications, it can be difficult and expensive for enterprises to fully utilize its benefits.With the adoption of distributed ledgers, many projects have put efforts to lower the barriers to entry. VeChain is one such blockchain platform built to improve widespread use of blockchain technology. One of the most significant issues facing supply chain organizations is a lack of transparency, which blockchain aims to resolve by enabling businesses to conduct transactions directly and without a third party. It also allows data sharing between stakeholders and supports increased integration of financial and logistical services.This article will discuss what VeChain public blockchain is, the unique features of VeChain, how VeChain (VET) works, how to buy VeChain and how VeChain staking works.What is VeChain (VET)?A public blockchain called VeChainThor is intended for widespread use of blockchain technology by companies of all sizes by acting as the building block for a resilient and expandable enterprise blockchain ecosystem.According to VeChain, Ethereum remains unsuited for running large-scale commercial decentralized applications (DApps) while being a significant technological milestone. It is because Ethereum does not have a robust governance framework to allow for quick and transparent protocol changes to address emerging issues or breakthroughs. Also, an appropriate economic model is absent in the Ethereum blockchain, restricting businesses from operating their DApps at a controllable and predictable cost. In addition, given how volatile the price of Ether (ETH) is, companies may not forecast future ETH prices or the expense of maintaining an Ethereum-based decentralized application for a specific time. So, what makes VeChain unique?The VeChainThor blockchain hopes to address the above issues using meta-transaction features, a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus method, an on-chain governance mechanism and a unique two-token system.Meta-transaction featuresFor enterprise adoption, VeChain’s meta-transaction features, as discussed below, help make the development user-friendly:Multi-party payment: A decentralized application’s freemium model is enabled by flexible transaction fee delegation schemes to onboard users smoothly. With VeChain’s innovative fee delegation protocol, an enterprise can have a smart contract and designated gas account to manage the gas fees necessary to use the network.Controllable transaction lifecycle: Users can set the time when a transaction is executed or expires if it is not included in a block using the Expiration and BlockRef transaction fields.Multi-task transaction: Developers can batch payments, include many calls to various contract functions in a single transaction and control the order of the calls using multi-function atomic transactions.Transaction dependency: Users can set dependencies to stop transactions from being executed until the relevant transaction has been processed, ensuring that the execution order satisfies the business need.POA consensus mechanismPoA addresses the frequent issues businesses have with energy waste and ineffective upgrades. VeChain’s proof-of-authority is efficient because:Hard forks can be avoided if Authority Masternodes don’t update, thanks to the built-in smart contract.Low computation power is required to achieve network security and consensus integrity.The Foundation rigorously verifies the identities of all Authority Masternodes Operators.GovernanceThe community-elected Steering Committee, which oversees the VeChain ecosystem, makes decisions and ensures that they are carried out with the help of the on-chain governance mechanism (covering stages such as proposing, approving and executing). Other benefits of such a system include lower organizational and technical development uncertainty due to role-based voting.Dual token economyThe VeChain ecosystem comprises two tokens: VeChain Token (VET) and VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). The first token, VET, is used to create the second token VTHO, and to make payments or remittances to other VeChain users. With the VTHO token, transaction fees are settled, and the platform’s gas and smart contract development costs are covered. How does VeChain (VET) work?The platform uses a PoA consensus algorithm that helps secure transactions on the blockchain network by using a network of 101 Authority Masternode operators. These operators carry out smart contract operations while upholding the VeChainThor governance rules. Under the direction of the steering committee, users must complete rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and be able to contribute to the network’s growth, whether as a business, developer or other entity. Moreover, a unique two-token system (as discussed above) ensures that firms are protected from market speculation and excessive market volatility and can be more confident of their operating costs.VeChain ToolChain is the key product offered by the VeChainThor blockchain platform that allows companies of all sizes to develop new services and products collaboratively. VeChain ToolChain provides platform-as-a-service (PaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS), and blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) to create new strategies for generating value for various stakeholders, promote transparency and offer insights into product life cycles.For instance, VeChain’s low-code deployment PaaS allows customers to design process templates and use the in-built tools to avoid creating their own blockchain applications from scratch. In addition, its Food Safety Track &amp; Trace SaaS offers the food and beverage industry a range of easily deployable traceability features, such as quality certificates, to communicate and reliably increase brand recognition. Through BaaS, VeChain offers a restful API to standardized smart contract services. Two computer systems use the restful API, an application programming interface, to exchange information safely over the internet.Furthermore, according to VeChain tokenomics, the circulating supply is decreased by burning 70% of all transaction fees, with the remaining 30% going to masternode operators. For node owners, VeChainThor offers a sustainable reward structure.History of VeChain: Who is behind VeChain?The former chief information officer of Louis Vuitton China, Sunny Lu, along with Changpeng Zhao (Chinese-Canadian founder of Binance) founded VeChain in 2015 as a subsidiary of Bitse, an organization that provides blockchain-powered solutions. The VEN token once operated on the Ethereum platform, but in 2018, VeChain switched to its own blockchain and rebranded itself as the VeChainThor (VET) blockchain. Through data transparency, VeChain hopes to disrupt the supply chain industry. The business has collaborated with several companies, including Microsoft, PWC, BMW, Renault and Volkswagen, to take advantage of the unique features of the VeChainThor blockchain to enhance their business operations.Related: How blockchain technology is used in supply chain management?How to buy VeChain?Depending upon your jurisdiction, choose a crypto exchange that supports VeChain (VET) cryptocurrency and buy a wallet to store your tokens. Alternatively, you can keep your tokens in the exchange wallet.VeChain has also developed the Thor wallet specifically for its own cryptocurrency, which is compatible with both Android and iOS. However, VeChain tokens are incompatible with wallets like MetaMask since they are not based on the Ethereum blockchain. The final step is to purchase VET tokens for the amount you desire and transfer them to the wallet of your choice for safekeeping.To buy VeChain (VET) on Binance, the key steps include the following:Apart from buying VET, can you make passive income with VeChain? Typically, users must first buy other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and then trade their BTC for VET after locating a wallet or exchange that supports VeChain staking. There aren’t any staking pools where one can combine VET investments to earn more VTHO, unlike other cryptocurrencies.Related: How to earn passive crypto income with BitcoinDoes VeChain have NFTs?Along with VeChain’s use cases in the supply chain, its nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystem is also thriving. For creating and trading VIP-181 tokens that are kept on the VeChain blockchain, there is a decentralized NFT marketplace called VeSea. The VeChain Foundation introduced the VIP-181 Standard, which enables fundamental functionality for tokens within smart contracts.Users require a VeChain-compatible wallet in order to sell, purchase, and store NFTs on VeSea, which is compatible with VeChain Sync2 and VeChainThor Wallet. Additionally, because of the effectiveness of the underlying blockchain, VeSea has no gas expenses. However, users need to pay a 2.5% trading fee.VeChain offers two NFT collections: VeKings and Paper Project. The 8,147 pieces of art are available in the VeKings NFT series, depicting the Vikings and Valkyries, symbols of the illustrious VeChain Empire. A total of 11,880 uniquely generated NFTs make up the interactive NFT Paper Project, which was developed and is being directed by Southern California-based artist Emmet Ahlstrom.If anyone currently own an asset from one of these two NFT collections, VeSea will offer them a discount of up to 100%. World of V is another VeChain NFT marketplace compatible with the Sync2 wallet, which is free to use. In addition, by offering complete minting support, the platform welcomes new NFT projects through its launchpad and allows nonfungible token owners to stake their NFTs in the creator ecosystem. Is VeChain a good investment?VeChain aims to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain technology by addressing issues, such as the high cost of maintaining an Ethereum-based DApp. Despite VeChain’s use cases in supply chain management and other industries, investment choice depends upon one’s financial objectives and risk-return profile.That said, investing in a cryptocurrency in which you feel you need more confidence can be risky, and you may lose your hard-earned money. Therefore, determine your asset-allocation decisions based on your expectations for returns on your investment. But, is the VeChain network secure? VeChain works with a number of security companies, including Hosho, Secureware, SlowMist, and HackenProof, to find potential vulnerabilities and proactively prevent cyber threats.The future of VeChainVeChain is a layer-1 smart contract platform that allows developers to create unique smart contracts and DApps on top of it. Its applications in logistics, supply chain management and other industries help businesses enhance their operations. However, from the investment perspective, one must always weigh the pros and cons before making portfolio allocations.As the future is uncertain, the same goes for VeChain. That said, it cannot be predicted if VeChain will become the new Ethereum. Whatever the case, it will be exciting to see how VeChain will compete with its rivals and offer distinct solutions to achieve a competitive edge.",2022-12-13

Jan3 CEO Samson Mow assumes that the depreciation of the euro, dollar & co. will continue to accelerate, while central banks around the world are struggling with double-digit inflation rates. For Bitcoin, he believes this would mean that the BTC/USD exchange rate will reach the magic $1M mark within the next five to ten years: ""happen very rapidly… It just sort of happens overnight, and then you are shoveling cash into a wheelbarrow"" Fearing runaway inflation, investors have been using precious metals like gold to diversify their portfolios for decades. That's because, much like Bitcoin, the physical supply is limited. Goldman Sachs believes that gold is much better than Bitcoin for diversifying a portfolio. This is mainly because there are no speculative use cases for gold. In the current market environment, gold gained slightly within the past year, while Bitcoin suffered a 75% drop in value. The reason for this is due to demand, as Goldman Sachs explains: ""Tighter liquidity should be a smaller drag on gold, which is more exposed to real demand drivers."" By this, the investment bank means not only central banks but also the industry, which uses declining prices to increase their stocks. In contrast, the crypto market regularly panics, which causes prices to plummet.Bitcoin technical price markersBitcoin is currently up 1.39% at a BTC/USD rate of $17,159, while the weekly gain is 0.92%. The cryptocurrency broke through the support of the 23.6% Fibo retracement of $16,986 yesterday, while the daily low was formed at $16,878. However, the daily closing price was above the Fibo retracement, which raises the possibility of a recovery toward the 38.2% Fibo retracement of $17,841. This resistance is reinforced by the 55-day MA of $17,993 and the immediate proximity to the psychological mark of $18,000.  Only if this area has been sustainably overcome, an extension of the upward movement toward the 50% Fibo retracement of $18,533 can be expected. If, on the other hand, a daily close below the 23.6% Fibo retracement occurs, the focus shifts to the November 28 low, found at $16,013. Below that, a test of the cycle low of $15,504 should be expected. (Translated from German)  ",2022-12-13

Hours later, a bigger shock wave — the theory that Barry killed Honey, then took his own life. The Toronto media were quoting “police sources” and a homicide detective at the scene said they were not seeking any “outstanding suspects.”That police theory changed to “targeted” double homicide five weeks later when the Star published details of the private autopsy arranged by the Sherman family. Markings on the Shermans’ wrists revealed they’d been bound while alive. Plus, there were thin ligature marks around their necks, under the belts that were holding them in a seated position beside their swimming pool. The belts were used to stage, not kill them.   ×        Already a Subscriber? Sign in  You are logged in   Switch accounts    How could Barry have killed Honey and then himself with his hands tied? With no ties found at the scene? To this day I remain troubled by another aspect of the early investigation. Why did the Sherman family and their team not simply give their autopsy results to the police?          ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW                       ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             Now here I am five years later immersed in all things Sherman — the family battles, the police struggles, the hunt for the killer. This case is not just about two wealthy, incredibly charitable murder victims, it’s about the abilities of police and pathologists in the biggest city in Canada to get it right. If mistakes can be made in such a high-profile case, what about the ones that fly under the radar?I often get asked if I have a theory on who did it. I do. I believe the police do as well. But a theory without evidence is, well, just a theory.What I can offer on this five-year anniversary is a 30,000-foot view of the characters in a terrible drama that has split up a family. Who was where when they died and when they got the news, and what was going on in the lives of the Shermans, family and friends around Dec. 13, 2017, the day they were murdered.              Just this past week, two of the four Sherman children, Alexandra, left and Jonathon, released separate statements urging people to come forward with information. Jonathon also announced an increase in a reward for infomation leading to an arrest to $35 million from $10 million.   tania_pereira    Police say the case is “active and ongoing.” Just this past week, two of the four Sherman children, Alexandra and Jonathon, released separate statements asking for people to come forward with information.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2017Barry Sherman was disappointed. A $6.7 million offer had just come in for their house at 50 Old Colony Rd., $200,000 under the asking price.“It wasn’t quite enough so we were trying to get a second offer to encourage competition,” recalls veteran Toronto realtor Elise Stern. Previously, there had been a $5 million offer, which the other agent on the file dismissed as “ridiculous.”Barry was a billionaire — worth an estimated $10 billion, company insiders say — but every penny counted. Back in the ’80s he paid $2.5 million to build Old Colony, sued the builders and recovered almost all of that. This was a man, after all, whose favourite meal was a Swiss Chalet quarter-chicken dinner, and who drove a rusted-out Ford Mustang while his less wealthy friends wheeled around in Jaguars and Bentleys.              Unlike his less wealthy friends who tooled around in Jaguars and Bentlys, Barry Sherman drove a rusting Ford Mustang, pictured in a crime scene photo at 50 Old Colony Rd.   Toronto Police    “I’ve got a home inspection report at the office,” Barry told Stern when he and Honey met the realtor at their home on Tuesday evening. “I’ll bring it home tomorrow.” Barry’s thinking: Maybe there was something in that report on 50 Old Colony that would help them get the higher price.He’d only agreed to sell the home where they had raised four children to please Honey. She’d convinced him to build a $30-40 million home in Forest Hill, closer to daughter Alexandra and their two grandchildren.          ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             That Tuesday evening, Barry and Honey were to have gone to Alexandra’s home for a Hanukkah celebration, but emails show that plans changed and it was rescheduled for Friday. When Honey suggested earlier in the day that she and Barry “cld also drop by today tues or tomorrow wed.” Alexandra, busy with a newborn, responded, “Can we hold off on tonight’s visit and just see you on Friday?” Honey said “no problem” and plans were struck for a nice Friday night dinner. Honey planned to make potato latkes.Looking around the home where they raised four children, Barry would have noticed it was tidier than normal. All Tuesday a team of “declutterers” had gone through the 12,000-square-foot house, boxing up donations for the Salvation Army, and donating a few items to Honey’s personal assistant and their housekeeper. Honey was supervising, though not feeling well. Still, the “bionic woman” as friends called Honey (due to knee, shoulder and hip replacements) was rallying, helping to go through three decades of clutter. The cleaning lady gave her an iced tea and Honey, chuckling with the decluttering team, said she was excited to be soon leaving for Florida, had a trip to Japan with Barry planned for March and one for Israel in April. The cleaning lady tidied the home, made the bed in Honey’s room, and the one Barry slept in (due to snoring issues). She tidied other parts of the house but not the rarely used swimming pool room — it had not been cleaned for three weeks.  At around 7 that Tuesday evening, son Jonathon and husband Fred flew in from their vacation in Japan. Jonathon told the Star that he was “jet-lagged” and he and Fred went to their home north of Toronto to rest.Lauren, the eldest Sherman child, a therapist and yoga instructor, was on vacation in Mexico. Kaelen, the youngest Sherman, was in Toronto, preparing for her marriage to Jared Render, who worked at Apotex. They would marry after the murders and divorce quickly, at Kaelen’s request, shortly after.Mary Shechtman, Honey’s sister, was at home in Forest Hill, packing to leave for Florida where she, like the Shermans, owned a condo. Honey was to join her the following week, and then Barry.              Jack Kay, Barry Sherman's second in command at Apotex for 35 years, speaks at their funeral.   Funeral video              ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             Jack Kay, Barry’s long-time second in command, was also packing. He and his wife were flying to New York Wednesday morning to see Andrea Bocelli in concert Thursday evening.Frank D’Angelo, a Toronto businessman who Barry was close with (Barry funded some of his businesses), spoke to Barry on the phone Tuesday evening and “busted his balls” for not showing up to his annual Christmas lunch — Barry had gone there every year but this year had a meeting he had to attend.Kerry Winter, one of Barry’s four cousins, was feeling pretty bruised and battered that Tuesday evening. He had just lost his decade-plus court fight with his cousin Barry, seeking $1 billion on the theory that Barry owed him part of Apotex (Kerry’s father Lou Winter, a generic drug pioneer, had given Barry his start). Kerry and his siblings lost their battle in September and the week before the murders a Toronto judge ordered Kerry and his siblings to pay a $300,000 legal judgment to partially cover Barry’s legal expenses (Barry had asked for $1 million). Kerry felt he had fought the good fight, and he was ably represented by Toronto lawyer Brad Teplitsky, a sole practitioner with a reputation for integrity and taking up cases on behalf of underdogs.That Tuesday night, as Kerry told me, he was at Teplitsky’s home signing some legal papers as part of an appeal. Out of the blue, Kerry said to his lawyer that he was surprised that Barry never settled the lawsuit.“I said, ‘Brad, do you think it’s ever crossed Barry’s mind that my brother Jeffrey could go off the deep end and kill him?’ ”Kerry would later tell the Star and other media that he himself had long fantasized about murdering Barry, and also that he believes to this day it was a murder suicide. Jeffrey told the Star last year he always had a great relationship with Barry prior to their lawsuit — he said Barry helped fund his business — and that he had nothing to do with the murder.Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2017          ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             With Old Colony for sale, the home was a buzz of activity. There was one offer on the table from 20 recent showings. Painters were doing touch-ups, including a basement room where there had been some water damage. Sheila Stanley, Honey’s assistant, was there too. She’d been given the next few days off by Honey and was making sure all of her work was completed. Upstairs, the morning workouts were underway.Barry was first at 8:30 a.m., doing everything he could to avoid exerting himself. Trainer Denise Gold, a good friend of the Shermans, was doing her best. Barry, not a typical “dog guy” used the excuse of asking Gold about her pooch — anything to delay the inevitable. Honey insisted that Barry, 75, do at least two sessions a week. Of note in that day’s workout, Gold did not use any resistance or workout bands on the wrists of either Sherman, something police would later ask her about when marks were noticed on wrists during both autopsies (it was only the second autopsy where the pathologist correctly identified that the Shermans had been bound).After his hour workout, Barry got ready for work, putting on for the first time one of two belts purchased by Honey at Canadian Tire ($9.99 each). He kissed Honey goodbye, and left. Gold recalls what a “great mood” both were in that morning. Honey reminded Barry that she would see him at Apotex at 5 p.m. for a meeting to discuss their new house plans. After Barry left, Honey did a two-hour workout with Gold, followed by a two-hour massage by a masseuse she had used for years.During Barry’s workout he’d received an email from son Jonathon — information on where Barry should send money to a California law firm that specializes in helping people with surrogacy. His father was “helping me make a family,” says Jonathon. The initial payment was $311,609 on Dec. 5, which Barry in an email remarked “seems very high.” Jonathon was now asking for an additional $17,677 (all figures U.S.). Once Barry arrived at the Apotex offices he gave instructions to staff at his personal holding company Sherfam for this second payment to be made.There were other financial issues between Jonathon and Barry in recent days. Jonathon provided the Star with a series of emails which showed that Barry had two weeks before asked for Jonathon and his business partner Adam Paulin to repay to him $50-$60 million. As the Star has reported, Barry had over the years loaned Jonathon and Adam at least $125 million to fund their self-storage business. But now Barry had a looming $580 million judgment, having lost one of his patent cases, and told his son that he needed the money.Barry did write in an email to Jonathon that he hoped to resume funding to Jonathon and his partner in a year and a bit. However, one of Barry’s last emails to his son on the matter was curt, regarding the payback. “What will you do and when?”Jonathon has told me his father was “all in” with Jonathon’s storage business, Green Storage. That bank loan to repay Barry was never arranged.          ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW             Up at Apotex in the northwest corner of Toronto, just before noon, Barry had a quick chat with Jack Kay before his second in command headed for the airport with his wife for the New York trip. Barry and Jack had worked together since the early 1980s and they shared an office space near the front of the Apotex building, near reception. Honey was the reason Jack was jetting off to New York for three days. At a charity event in New York the previous summer she had bid for the tickets and convinced Jack to bid too — then dropped her arm when Jack’s went up.At 5 p.m. at Apotex, the builders of the Shermans’ new Forest Hill home arrived for a scheduled meeting. As they waited for Honey (she was always running late, friends say) Barry kibitzed with the builders, asking:“We probably only have 10 years to live. Is it worth it to build a house for such a high price?”When Honey came bustling in a few minutes after 5 p.m. they got down to business, discussing what type of windows and doors they should purchase for the new home. One builder later told police that the meeting was to be at Old Colony, but it was changed. The builder later told police that Honey mentioned during the meeting that Barry normally works until 11 p.m. but he was going home early that night for a reason the builder could not recall. The meeting ended with the Shermans and builders consulting calendars to book the next meeting to discuss the plans.In the gallows humour he was known for, Barry once told an author of a book on pharmaceuticals that if anyone wanted to kill him they could shoot him coming out of his office late at night. Just the previous Sunday at a Toronto Maple Leafs game with Honey and another couple, Barry said he did not believe in having protection. “If they are going to get you, they are going to get you,” Barry said.The builders meeting ended at 6:15 p.m. Honey headed to Bayview Village Mall to buy Hanukkah presents for Alexandra’s two children. A CIBC bank camera recorded footage of Honey, but that footage has not been made public by police. Honey was home from the mall just before 8 p.m. Barry stayed at Apotex until 8:30 p.m., sending emails about an issue with one of their India plants. His last email was sent to Jack Kay, who was in New York, at 8:23 p.m. Barry was home at Old Colony by 9 p.m.People close to the Shermans are in various places that evening, according to interviews by the Star. Kerry Winter was at a 12-step program, then went home, watched an episode of “Peaky Blinders,” chatted by phone with his girlfriend and went to bed. Frank D’Angelo was at home with his partner watching television. Jonathon was at his home just north of Toronto — he provided the Star with a photo he took of his hand holding a piece of paper with cryptocurrency codes snapped at 7:17 p.m. that Wednesday evening. Jack Kay was in New York. Honey’s sister Mary was in Toronto getting ready for her trip to Florida. The other children were in Toronto (Alexandra and Kaelen) and Mexico (Lauren).As the police have revealed, just after 9 p.m. the mysterious “Walking Man” who they believe is the killer or one of the killers was in the vicinity of the Sherman home that night.              A year ago investigators released a video of a person identified as a suspect in the Sherman murders. The mysterious ""Walking Man"" was captured on neighbourhood surveillance just after 9 p.m. the night the Shermans were killed.   Freelance    Police took the numbers of almost everyone they interviewed (about 250 people) and checked to see if they had cellular communication with someone in the vicinity of the Sherman home that Wednesday night. Police came up empty-handed.Based on the findings at the crime scene, it appears Honey was surprised as she arrived home. Her iPhone with its pink jewelled case was found in a powder room she never uses near the front of the house (Honey always entered from the side door where she parked her car).Barry had remembered to bring home for the realtor his marked-up copy of the home inspection report on Old Colony, in his bid to make sure he received maximum value for the sale. That inspection report was found by realtor Stern just outside the door of the underground garage where Barry parked that night. It looked like it had been dropped, along with his leather winter gloves.Thursday, Dec. 14, 2017  Related Stories                                        Barry and Honey Sherman’s son raises reward to $35M, report says                                                                           Barry and Honey Sherman’s daughter pleads for help to solve parents’ murder                                                                           Barry and Honey Sherman homicide detectives seek information in 5 countries                                     The Shermans are dead inside their house. Their bodies are posed in a macabre tableau, seated on the floor of their basement swimming pool room. Leather belts (believed to be those two Canadian Tire belts) are looped around their necks and tied to a low railing. They are tilted back at the waist. The underwater pool lights are on. All other lights in the house are off.In a rare situation for the Shermans, nobody is expected at the house that day. No real estate showings, no workers, Sheila Stanley, Honey’s assistant, was given days off by Honey. There’s a furnace repair man, but he’s not scheduled until Friday.The neighbour’s security camera across the road picks up a man parking in front of the Sherman house in the morning, going up and back to the front door three times, before driving off. Then police chief Mark Saunders has said the homicide squad knows who that person was — but he won’t make the information public. And just a few doors away that Thursday morning, police are knocking on doors asking about a mysterious 911 call from the area. Again, police will not reveal the time of the call or where they think it originated. One theory I have heard from the Sherman family is that it was related to the murders.That Thursday morning, Mary, Honey’s sister and best friend, heads to the airport and flies to Florida. Several of the Sherman friends are already there (Honey was going the following Monday, and Barry on Dec. 24). Harry Radomski, Barry’s longtime lawyer, is there with his wife. So is Judi Gottlieb, the other agent who shared the listing on Old Colony with Elise Stern. Emails between Sherman friends, including Fred and Bryna Steiner (the Shermans’ oldest “couple” friends) reveals Honey was making plans to see all of them when she arrived.At Apotex, people are wondering where Barry is, but nobody is overly concerned, though they did all note in interviews with the Star it was odd that Barry was not responding to emails about pressing matters. His executive assistant assumes he is spending time with his new grandchild.That Thursday, before heading to a dinner with friends in downtown Toronto, Jonathon emails Barry asking if he will come to the Green Storage Christmas party. According to Jonathon’s husband Fred, they had also invited Barry to a Christmas dinner at their house north of Toronto on Dec. 24 (the day Barry was scheduled to fly to Florida). Fred later told police that it was often difficult for him to be at Sherman events and during dinners at Old Colony he would often go to the basement to “get away from people during family dinners.”As Thursday wound down, daughter Alexandra texted photos of her kids, but did not hear back.Friday, Dec. 15, 2017Mary, Honey’s sister, is the first family member to learn that Barry and Honey are dead. She is in Florida. The Sherman realtor, Elise Stern, made the grisly discovery shortly after 11 a.m. and alerts Mary and police. Mary tries to reach Alexandra but gets voicemail. She calls Jonathon and reaches him just as he and husband Fred are pulling into the driveway of their new cottage northeast of Peterborough. He and Mary make calls, alerting the extended family and everyone will converge at Alexandra’s home later that afternoon.              Mary Shechtman, Honey Sherman's sister, is the first family member to learn that Barry and Honey are dead. She is in Florida when the Sherman's realtor, Elise Stern, called after making the grim discovery.   Funeral video    Frank D’Angelo is driving to Collingwood with his partner and a news alert comes on their phones. Kerry Winter also learns through a news report, calls his brother Jeffrey and asks him if he was responsible. Jeffrey says no. Later, Kerry says his girlfriend asked if he, Kerry, did it, and he says no.This flurry of comments and accusations is indicative of the first few weeks of the investigation. Police files unsealed by a judge reveal that a lot of fingers are pointed in a lot of directions.Jonathon tells police some people have a “grudge” against his parents and would want to hurt them. He names people, but who he names remains sealed by court order. His own sister, Alexandra, thinks Jonathon was involved, but Jonathon says he is not.Today, other than the mysterious “walking man,” police continue to pursue leads involving several people they have not named. Police say the estate of Barry and Honey Sherman is “embedded” in their probe — but will not explain further. Here’s how one of the most recent police requests for permission to obtain information ends:“At this point in the investigation, investigators are trying to determine who is responsible for the deaths of Bernard Sherman and Honey Sherman. Currently several persons have been implicated, through witness statements, as responsible for the murders of Bernard Sherman and Honey Sherman. To date, there is no evidence to elevate any of the aforementioned parties to the status of a suspect.”  ",2022-12-13

OCEAN, FET, and XRP are great tokens to trade.   December has been a somber month for cryptocurrencies as investors focused on the upcoming Fed decision and activities surrounding FTX’s collapse. Bitcoin has remained steady at $17,000 while the total market cap in the industry has been stuck at about $830 billion. Here are some of the top penny cryptos to watch in December. Ocean Protocol | OCEAN Ocean Protocol is a blockchain project in the data analytics industry. It runs a digital marketplace where users can sell all kinds of data. $OCEAN is the native token for the network. It is used to stake on data for curation and buying and selling data.  In the chart below, we see that the OCEAN price went parabolic in December as investors rushed to buy the coin. It jumped to the highest level since November 9, which was about 95% above the lowest level this year. The token has risen above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved close to the overbought level. Therefore, OCEAN token price will likely remain volatile in December, making it a good one to trade. If this happens, it will likely retest the important resistance level at $0.2240.

Sources said many of Binance's executives along with as many as 100 other employees worked at the office.""CZ, as he is colloquially known in the crypto space, refuted the report and said that Binance did not have an office in Shanghai for more than two years.Over the weekend, Axios released a report exposing that Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the crypto derivatives exchange FTX, ""secretly funded crypto news site"" The Block.The report revealed that Bankman-Fried loaned the crypto media and its CEO, Michael McCaffrey, $43 million for over a year.The first loan was worth $12 million and was allegedly used to fund the site's move to buy out its investors.The second, apparently worth $15 million, was allegedly used to finance the outlet's daily operations.Furthermore, the third loan worth $16 million was allegedly used by McCaffrey to purchase a private real estate property in the Bahamas.   Reuters  The CEO stepped down from his post after he failed to disclose the series of loans he got from Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research and was replaced by the company's Chief Revenue Officer Bobby Moran.""No disclosure has ever been made by The Block of the financial support from Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, or that McCaffrey-controlled LLCs received loans from Alameda,"" Axios further reported.""No one at The Block had any knowledge of this financial arrangement besides Mike,"" the new Block CEO said in a statement.""From our own experience, we have seen no evidence that Mike ever sought to improperly influence the newsroom or research teams, particularly in their coverage of SBF, FTX and Alameda Research.""In a Twitter thread, McCaffrey said that in the early part of 2021, The Block was in a tight spot and ""the only option that materialized"" was to ""restructure when I was able to obtain a $12 million loan for my holding company from SBF,"" he added.2/ In early 2021, The Block was in a precarious place, and I was evaluating whether to sell, merge or restructure.

(Photographer: Bloomberg/Bloomberg)ShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveApologies from tech chief executive officers are in vogue, as years of easy money and pandemic profits come to an end. “I got this wrong,” Mark Zuckerberg   said after the Facebook billionaire’s pivot to a more Meta world decimated its stock price and led to 11,000 layoffs. Charismatic leaders are learning humility.Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.ArrowRightBut in the league of weak-sauce apologies, the one from cryptocurrency exchange boss Sam Bankman-Fried stands head and shoulders above the rest. After his digital-asset empire FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday, the onetime billionaire — who’s now lost it all —  tweeted that he was “really sorry,” “shocked” at how things unraveled and “hopeful” that some kind of recovery was possible.Let’s start with the hope. Judging by the scale and complexity of this bankruptcy — more than 130 entities with assets and liabilities in the tens of billions of dollars — customers have little reason to be hopeful. It will take time and money to sift through claims, with customers at the back of the line if the recent bankruptcy of Celsius is any guide. Martin Finnegan, a partner at Punter Southall, is skeptical of chances of recovery given legal fees and a likely lengthy process.AdvertisementThen there’s the shock. To use that word is to pay homage to Captain Renault in Casablanca, who was “shocked, shocked” to uncover a gambling den — before being handed his winnings. Even if FTX’s collapse was precipitated by market pressure by rival Binance on its proprietary FTT coin, this only brought to light deeper issues at the exchange — such as lending more than half its customer funds to support risky bets by supposedly separate trading firm Alameda, according to the  Wall Street Journal. The shock has spread to FTX’s former head of sales, who reportedly said he and his colleagues had been left “in the dark” about insolvency issues until it was too late.And then, finally, the apology itself. It deserves as much value as the FTT token that once propped up Bankman-Fried’s empire. Is this an apology for stoking speculative excitement with unsustainable leverage during the good times, such as when Bankman-Fried eagerly explained his lucrative yield-farming business in terms that my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Matt Levine  compared to Ponzi schemes? Or his handling of the bad times, when, as FTX was teetering on the brink, Bankman-Fried tweeted customer assets were safe? It’s unclear, though the latter tweet has disappeared.The ex-billionaire’s confessional tweets sound so empty because the downfall of FTX isn’t just about a frothy market coming undone, similar to the way inflation has battered big technology companies. It looks more like the combination of a good old-fashioned financial bubble and, as Larry Summers   points out, the murky accounting complexity of Enron — whose executives were once dubbed the “smartest guys in the room” — with Bankman-Fried at its heart.AdvertisementBankman-Fried, after all, knew how to ride the crypto craze: He reveled in his image of the quant-trading wunderkind, who supposedly got his start spotting inefficiencies in Bitcoin trading across different exchanges. His charisma became adept at separating sophisticated investors, not just retail ones, from their money, attracting even pension funds to a platform that seemed to encourage dialogue with regulators and institutions. With one hand FTX took money offshore through leveraged bets and operating its own token and with the other donated to politicians and offered regulations to make the sector healthier.Share this articleShareWhile financial history should have inspired caution — and I   noted on   several occasions the risks that investors were ignoring when posting funds to FTX and other exchanges — it instead inspired greed and trust. William Quinn, co-author of a history of financial bubbles, compares the FTT token promoted by FTX to an artificial increase of purchasing power that fueled the market bubble. Using that token as collateral expanded Bankman-Fried’s wealth and that of his customers but also rapidly increased the complexity and risk of his empire. The result was an unsustainable house of cards.FTX was not the first crypto exchange to fall over. And it likely won’t be the last. There will be talk of better regulation, though enforcing existing laws and protecting consumers would be a better start. But in this case, one thing is for sure: Sorry isn’t good enough.AdvertisementMore From Bloomberg Opinion:• FTX Is   a Feature, Not Bug, of Financial Innovation: Aaron Brown• Crypto   Can Survive the Possible Demise of FTX: Tyler Cowen• FTX-Binance   Debacle Shows Crypto’s Biggest Weakness: Editorial(This story originally ran on Nov. 12, 2022.

Thereafter, however, reports of major token withdrawals by Justin Sun, CEO and founder of TRON, exacerbated tensions. Despite Zhao likewise taking critics to task and Sun performing a $100 million deposit back to Binance, users were quick to remove their own funds from their accounts.

What’s an ICO? Investing in an ICO is a unique opportunity to access the pre-public sale of cryptocurrencies. Unlike IPO’s, which offer shares of companies going public, those investing on ICOs receive digital tokens instead.  2023 will be a crucial year for these investors as they need projects that solve pressing issues and prove their potential returns are worth it – turning good ideas into great investments. The new world of ICO crypto offers excitement and innovation as a wide variety of projects remain untethered to traditional regulations. This can be an attractive prospect for those looking to launch their own endeavours that may have otherwise been hindered by complex bureaucratic requirements. How Do ICOs Work? ICOs are growing in popularity as an innovative new way to finance projects. Rather than relying on banks or traditional methods, anyone with the right technology and expertise can develop their own ICO structure – be it uncapped supplies, capped limits or anything else that fits. The three main structures of ICOs are:   Pre-set token price + Capped supply   Variable token price + Capped supply   Pre-set token price + Variable supply   Of course for these initiatives to succeed they need investors so savvy marketing becomes a key factor too; from collaborations with leading ICO agencies all the way through social media engagement. Interested in investing in an up-and-coming cryptocurrency? The process is easy. All you need to do is find a project that resonates with your goals, register on the project’s website and purchase tokens through its exchange. As soon as these are acquired, store them safely away in a crypto wallet until it’s listed for sale – then get ready for some potential market opportunity. How to Find New Upcoming ICOs Cryptocurrency investment is blossoming, which makes it easier than ever for investors to discover potential new ICOs.  Whether you’re a novice or veteran investor, there are numerous ways that can be used to identify the next big crypto opportunity – from monitoring blog posts and forums to attending events.  Whatever your strategy may be, uncovering upcoming token sales has never been more accessible. Use social media: Crypto enthusiasts are blessed with a wealth of resources to inform their investments. Twitter and Reddit provide unparalleled real-time updates on new projects, while YouTube channels offer up engaging and objective discussions around upcoming cryptocurrency initial coin offerings (ICOs). Keeping one’s finger firmly on the pulse is essential for any crypto investor. Keep track with an ICO calendar: CoinMarketCap’s ICO calendar provides an exciting glimpse into the future of crypto-finance. It offers a comprehensive overview of upcoming Initial Coin Offerings, including their projected launch and conclusion dates as well as each project’s funding targets. Investing via ICOs requires careful research – but with this valuable tool at your disposal you’ll be prepared to make informed decisions on which projects deserve your attention. ICO platforms: If you’re interested in investing in ICOs and IDOs, there are plenty of resources available. Dedicated websites provide information on the opportunities they offer as well as conducting thorough KYC checks to give potential investments ratings based on their projected success rate. Are New ICO Coins a Good Investment? Crypto presales and ICOs entry can be a part of an investor’s portfolio, but is it really worth the risk? Before deciding to jump in on the digital currency bandwagon, consider these factors: potential returns, legal protection and transparency. With thoughtful analysis you might find yourself at the forefront of lucrative investment opportunities. Access to New and Exciting Use Cases Investing in ICOs can help savvy investors gain access to valuable tokens that may disrupt the crypto market. A sterling example of this is Battle Infinity’s ambitious project, which attempts to unite an impressive six distinct ideas into a single metaverse-powered ecosystem – something no other blockchain has yet achieved. Potential for Huge Returns ICOs provide a unique opportunity for investors, with the potential to reap immense rewards should their chosen project reach success. Costing only a fraction of what will be possible further down the line, these investments make it accessible for nearly anyone looking to add some spice and financial gain into their portfolio. Crypto tokens offer investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of potentially lucrative projects. EOS is one case study that shows just what’s possible when it comes to returns – their 2017 ICO saw early adopters quadruple their money within twelve months. Generate Passive Income The crypto world has never been so lucrative. Whether it’s through staking, yield farming or passive taxation rewards on ‘static’ projects, investors can now rake in regular income streams solely for holding tokens. And with many ICO coins also offering thrilling P2E (player-to-entity) gaming opportunities that offer even more generous returns – there’s no better time to join the digital currency revolution and start cashing in. Best Upcoming ICOs – Final Thoughts With investors keeping a keen eye on the market, 2023 is posed to be an interesting year in terms of Initial Coin Offerings. Amongst ten exceptional projects announced this week stands Metacade, which has already made waves amongst early adopters and promises exciting opportunities for those willing to take the risk.

The core inflation, which excludes food and energy, likely rose 6.1% following October's 6.3% increase.To the uninitiated, bullish call options give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, put options give the right to sell.A call buyer compensates the call seller for offering protection against bullish moves by paying a premium when the contract is purchased. The premium received is the call seller's maximum profit, while the maximum loss is unlimited, as, in theory, the market can rise to infinity.Calls gain value when the market rises and bleed when the market drops. Seasoned traders sell higher strike or above-spot price call options when the market is expected to fall or stay flat.In the trade suggested by Cumberland, the June expiry calls will lose premium, making money for the call seller, if the data shows inflation remained elevated in November. A hotter-than-expected print would dash hopes for a Fed pivot in favor of rate cuts, pushing bitcoin lower and eroding the value of calls.""There is reason to believe that a high CPI print on Tuesday could be a tipping point, giving risk assets a strong reason to move back towards the downside and thus generating delta P&amp;L through call selling,"" Cumberland noted.What if CPI brings risk-on rally?At this point, the obvious question that comes to mind is, what if the CPI misses estimates, bolstering hopes for the Federal Reserve pivot and lifting bitcoin? In that case, wouldn't the June call options gain value, yielding a big loss for the seller?While call options stand to gain value in case of a bitcoin rally, the rate of gain is likely to be tepid.That's because the implied volatility, or the market's forecast of a potential movement in the underlying asset, is expected to drop following Tuesday's CPI and Wednesday's Fed rate decision. A drop in implied volatility, which can be equated with lesser uncertainty, benefits options sellers.""A low CPI should reassert the market’s confidence in inflation coming down, causing a rally in risk assets but bringing vols [implied volatility] down again (generating vega P&amp;L through call selling) as this narrative is already somewhat priced in,"" Cumberland said.Options vega measures the amount of increase or decrease in premium based on a 1% (100 basis points) change in the implied volatility (IV) assumption. A call buyer is long vega and stands to benefit from a rise in implied volatility, which can be equated with the degree of uncertainty. On the contrary, a call seller is short vega and will benefit from a drop in implied volatility.Besides, Cumberland favors buying short-dated options as a hedge against the risk of a potential blowup in volatility in the aftermath of the CPI report.""One can hedge this trade by buying some gamma (short-dated options expiring in December). The low levels of realized volatility have made the weekly straddle prices reasonably cheap compared to historical levels during data week,"" Cumberland noted.""This Friday’s BTC and ETH straddles are priced at 0.0453 and 0.0642, respectively, implying approximate moves of 4.5% and 6.4%,"" Cumberland added, referring to bitcoin and ether.Straddles is an options strategy that involves buying both call and put options when they are cheap relative to historical standards and implied volatility is expected to rise. Buying a straddle is akin to taking a bullish bet on volatility.Readers, however, should note that employing complex options strategies requires active management of position and ample capital supply. That's probably the reason why options market is dominated by institutions and sophisticated traders.",2022-12-13

Grayscale began its legal challenge of the SEC’s denial order of the proposed investment product in June 2022.A 73-page brief filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 9 saw the SEC lay out the reasoning for its initial decision to bar Grayscale’s request to convert its existing Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.The SEC is looking for the D.C. Circuit to deny Grayscale’s appeal, which claims the proposed fund is inherently different from futures ETFs it has approved in the past.Grayscale argues that the SEC's disapproval order violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the guidelines through which American federal agencies develop and issue regulations. The investment fund cited previous approvals by the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin futures contracts.Related: Grayscale fires first salvo in case against SEC over Bitcoin ETF refusalThe SEC had contested this point, noting that previously approved products only contained futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The exchange is a registrar of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and operates under “robust surveillance,” according to the SEC.The regulatory body believes the Bitcoin spot market is fragmented and unregulated in comparison to other investment vehicles. It also argues that Grayscale failed to provide a supportive argument that the CME’s surveillance of futures trading would “sufficiently detect and deter fraud and manipulation targeting the Bitcoin spot market.”Meanwhile, Grayscale maintains the SEC has failed to justify its different treatment of Bitcoin futures and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products. The fund argues these products track BTC’s price more directly and has labeled the regulator's denial order as discriminatory and harmful to investors.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has been operating since 2013 and offers accredited investors shares in the fund. The fund invests in BTC, giving investors exposure to the cryptocurrency in the form of a security, without having to directly acquire, manage and store BTC.Grayscale has been looking to convert the fund into an ETF since 2016. It reiterated its reasoning behind the move in the launch of its legal tussle with the SEC, saying the ETF would give wider access to BTC and enhance investor protection. ",2022-12-13

In total, crypto prices have plunged by more than 60% in 2022, shedding over $2 trillion worth of value. Bitcoin has slipped to $17,000 while the FTX Token has become worthless. Here are some of the best cryptos to buy this winter. GMX GMX is one of the fastest-growing players in decentralised finance (DeFi). It is a platform that makes it possible for people to trade cryptocurrencies and perpetual contracts in a decentralised manner.  Many traders prefer GMX because of its significant speed and lower costs since it is built on top of Arbitrum and Avalanche. Therefore, as concerns about centralised exchanges grow, there is hope that most investors will start to embrace DEXs. If this happens, GMX will likely be one of the top platforms to watch. GMX has seen the total volume locked (TVL) jump to an all-time high of almost $1 billion. At the same time, GMX price has soared to the highest level in months. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the token will continue rising as a rotation to DEXes continue.  How to buy GMX    dYdX dYdX is another leading DEX that provides a simple-to-use platform where users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. It handles hundreds of millions of dollars on a daily basis, making it one of the biggest exchanges in the world. Like GMX, the total value locked (TVL) in dYdX has risen to more than $440 million. There are two main reasons why the dYdX is a good crypto to buy in Winter. First, the network is building its dYdX chain on Cosmos. The token could rise on hopes of more activity in the protocol. Second, dYdX price will likely rise as activity in the network increases. How to buy dYdX    Ethereum Ethereum is another top crypto to buy in Winter. A closer look at ETH price chart shows that the coin has managed to stay afloat above $1,000 during the ongoing crypto winter. This is a bullish factor. At the same time, the network will launch its next upgrade in Q1’23. This upgrade will unlock the funds that have been staked in the network. Further, Ethereum remains the biggest player in all industries, including DeFi and Non-Fungible Token (NFT). Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will bounce back in the coming months.

Eve… [+5839 chars]",Fortune,"Sam Bankman-Fried, who goes by SBF, is at the center of the business scandal of the year. His cryptocurrency exchange FTX blew up suddenly in November, leaving millions of customers in the lurch. Everyone wants answers—including Congress, where SBF was supposed to testify on Tuesday. In a shocking turn of events, he was instead arrested on Monday night by authorities in the Bahamas, where he was residing, at the request of the U.S. government.   With SBF’s notable absence, the hearing will likely yield some tough questions from lawmakers, including into the investigation by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that led to his arrest. It will possibly create some awkward moments for members of Congress themselves, many of whom have been implicated in SBF’s web of failure. Here’s what you need to know:  What time is the hearing and how can I watch?  The hearing begins at 10 a.m. ET and will be streamed by the House of Representatives on YouTube and broadcast live on CSPAN 3.  Why is Congress holding this hearing?  After years of building up his reputation as the crypto industry’s golden child, Sam Bankman-Fried had a spectacular fall from grace in early November after his exchange, FTX, went bankrupt. It soon emerged that FTX was commingling customer funds with its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research. Now, as SBF faces investigations across the globe and criminal charges, Congress is looking to find out how this debacle happened, and what it means for the volatile crypto industry at a time when lawmakers are debating legislation. In the wake of the arrest, they will also want to inquire about the criminal investigation even though details of it are still emerging. Who is speaking?  With SBF in custody, the only speaker left on the docket is John J. Ray III, a U.S. attorney who famously led the failed energy company Enron through its bankruptcy proceedings.   After SBF resigned in mid-November, Ray took over as the CEO of FTX. Ray has been harsh through court filings about the incompetence of SBF and the previous executive team, declaring that he had never seen “such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.”   Ray has already published his planned testimony, which lays out in devastating legalese that FTX and its associated trading firm, Alameda Research, commingled customer funds and lacked basic financial controls. What will Ray be asked?   The biggest question facing FTX is whether SBF committed fraud by violating the exchange’s terms of service and commingling customer funds with the trading bets of Alameda Research—as well as for the empire’s profligate spending, from political donations to sponsorships.   Expect questions for Ray about what really happened in the black box of FTX, and how much SBF—the majority owner of both FTX and Alameda Research—knew what was going on.   What types of charges is SBF facing?   SBF is facing a plethora of charges, with the New York Times reporting that criminal charges include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering. The Securities and Exchange Commission also announced that it has authorized separate charges for violations of securities law.  If prosecutors decide to make him an example, some lawyers have said to look to the most notorious fraudster of the 2000s, Bernie Madoff, who was sentenced to 150 years in federal prison. What was SBF’s relationship with lawmakers?  The other uncomfortable elephant in the room will be SBF’s previous prominent stature in Washington. As a major advocate for crypto regulation, SBF was the industry’s face in the capital, frequently meeting with lawmakers and regulators.   In the wake of his descent, there will be probes about SBF’s political donations and how much he shaped lawmakers’ views on how to approach crypto regulation.   The pro-crypto legislators at the hearing are likely to shoot barbs directed toward Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, who many hold accountable for failing to stop the FTX disaster—although the majority of the company’s business operated offshore in the Bahamas. Will there be more hearings? The Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), is scheduled to host its own FTX hearing on Wednesday. Unlike the House Financial Services Committee’s sparse lineup, the Senate Banking Committee has four scheduled witnesses, including O.C. actor turned crypto critic Ben McKenzie—a move that drew some ire on Crypto Twitter. Messari founder Ryan Selkis was particularly peeved: In the past five years, I built a 150 person data & research company that automates crypto asset disclosures.During that time, @ben_mckenzie wrote an anti-Trump off Broadway play that bombed and spoke at SXSW.Which one of us did Senate Banking invite to testify on crypto?— Ryan Selkis 🥷 (@twobitidiot) December 9, 2022 The Senate Banking Committee had also asked SBF to testify under threat of subpoena, which he declined. After SBF’s arrest, that, of course, is no longer relevant. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said in a statement on Monday night that she was disappointed that SBF would not be able to testify and that the American public deserves to hear directly from him, leaving the door open for another hearing down the line.    Why the House Financial Services Committee?  The committee, led by Waters and ranking member Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), has been one of the most vocal for the need for crypto legislation. This includes the draft for a stablecoin bill sponsored by Waters and McHenry, although they never formally introduced it.   With the House shifting leadership and McHenry set to assume the chair position, the House Financial Services Committee is expected to be a leader for long-awaited crypto legislation during the next congressional session. Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter examines how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today's executives.

Here’s the full statement we sent the reporter and a blog about our remarkable law enforcement team.— Binance (@binance) December 12, 2022 Today, Reuters released a publication that US prosecutors are divided on whether they have enough evidence to prosecute Binance and its Executives. It is alleged that the charges under investigation are related to unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations. In the publication, Reuters accused Binance of processing over $10 billion in payments for criminals and aiding them to dodge sanctions in the United States and other countries.  Likewise, Reuters alleged that the case before Binance from the DOJ is a criminal investigation. The media house alleged that Binance is trying everything to ensure that the case doesn’t progress. In the report, Reuters said the inquiry would likely affect Binance’s influence on cryptocurrency.  Furthermore, Reuters said Binance’s attorneys had held numerous meetings with officials of the DOJ. The news agency cited Binance pleaded that the investigation could affect the stability of the cryptocurrency market. The report by Reuters referred to an investigation that surfaced in 2018. Binance’s Response to the Allegations and the Dragging Conflict With ReutersIn its response, Binance said Reuters is launching another attack on its legal team. Binance talked about how it has invested in its security and compliance team.  The cryptocurrency exchange said within a year, the headcount of its team has increased by 500%. Binance also said it had invested a lot in its legal team, not because the firm gains revenue from it, but because it’s the right thing to do.  Notably, Tigran Gambaryan, Binance VP of Global Intelligence and Investigations, highlighted how the investment had yielded positive rewards for the cryptocurrency exchange.  “Since November 2021, for example, Binance responded to over 47,000 law enforcement requests with an average response time of three days, which is faster than any traditional financial institution — some of which can take months, by which point the money has gone,” Gambaryan said Additionally, the executive discussed Binance’s Global Law Enforcement Training Program, which they developed to assist law enforcement and prosecutors worldwide in prosecuting criminals. According to Gambaryan, Binance has shared its insider knowledge and expertise with law enforcement and prosecutors in several countries through this program over the past year. On the FlipsideThis is not the first time Reuters has accused Binance of illicit activities. In the past, Binance has been embroiled in numerous controversial issues with Reuters concerning hacking and drug trafficking. This is due to the numerous reports from Reuters, which Binance has perceived not to be in its favour.  Why You Should CareFollowing the collapse of FTX, centralized exchanges, including Binance, are under investigators’ radar.

The final closing of the transaction is still subject to approval by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and is expected for the third quarter of 2023.  Bankhaus von der Heydt holds a full banking license and is one of the leading providers in Germany offering custody and tokenization of digital assets.

Through the merger, Bitcoin Group SE and Bankhaus von der Heydt, two crypto pioneers, will act together in the future.

For Bitcoin Group, it also opens up the opportunity to expand the business beyond the existing activities in the field of securities trading and trading as well as the custody of cryptocurrencies.

They recruited workers through Telegram—an encrypted messaging platform blocked in China—to open anonymous crypto accounts, which were then used to convert the funds back into Chinese yuan.The gang operated multiple laundering dens across the country, while workers earned different commissions based on their ranks after each transaction.

President Xi Jinping is pushing to buy oil using yuan, a move that threatens to rattle global energy trade and hit at the long-standing dominance of the US dollar.  Advertisement   Advertisement  At a summit with Arab leaders on Friday, Xi said China will continue to import large volumes of energy supplies from Gulf states, and settle payments using its own currency. ""The Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange platform will be fully utilized for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade,"" Xi said, according to a transcript of his speech published by the state-run China Daily. While the president didn't specify when the change would go into effect, and whether Gulf nations will take up the proposal, it's been reported that Saudi Arabia — the world's top oil exporter — has already been in talks for months to trade oil in yuan with China. As things stand, roughly 80% of global oil sales are done in dollars, and Saudi Arabia has inked deals exclusively in the greenback since 1974.  Advertisement   Advertisement  Should a Saudi-yuan deal crystallize, it would bolster China's currency at the expense of the dollar, as well as reinforce Beijing's status as a critical player in global financial markets. But it's hard to talk about China's role in oil markets without nodding to their extensive zero-COVID policies, which have crimped global oil demand since 2020. Currently, the international benchmark for crude is hovering around $77 a barrel, but a fully re-opened China could push prices above $100 a barrel next year, according to UBS. Easing pandemic measures in China combined with a Europe's ban on Russian oil imports, which came into effect last week, will stoke demand and stifle supply — meaning prices will go up.

The action comes after a turbulent year in which Asians experienced significant setbacks. The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing harsher regulations for crypto assets, according to a 13 December Bangkok Post story. However, stricter regulations typically make things harder for regular investors.  Furthermore, Thai investors that used the Zipmex platform were negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of the Celsius Network. When FTX fell in early November, Asian retail investors were likewise the ones who suffered the most. Following the steps of other countries As examples of what it aims to imitate, the agency mentioned recent laws from Singapore, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Singapore does not wish to discourage investment or innovation, though, and the city-state still serves as the region’s hub for cryptocurrencies.      A working committee is being established by the Thai SEC to look into the Bitcoin sector. Representatives from relevant government and private sector organizations will also be present. They will be charged with developing ideas for how to make the laws more environmentally friendly. The SEC wants to crack down on Bitcoin marketing and advertising, especially when it involves celebrities and influencers. After it was uncovered that several well-known athletes were accepting fees to support FTX, similar action was taken last month in the United States. In Thailand, stricter regulations restricting crypto advertising just went into effect, according to a formal notice from the nation’s securities commission. In addition to requiring the addition of obvious risk warnings against investing in cryptocurrencies, the new regulations forbid the inclusion of incorrect or inflated information regarding cryptocurrency enterprises, such as overstated user counts. In Thailand, cryptocurrency trading is still legal and accessible, but it is unclear how the government will limit it moving ahead. The central bank and authorities disagree with the claims made regularly by Thailand’s tourist ministry that the nation is a hotspot for the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, Thailand’s central bank is ready to develop its digital currency to follow China’s lead (CBDC). Furthermore, the Bank of Thailand is preparing to launch a retail CBDC pilot program before the end of the year. Thailand desires programmable money similar to China’s, which the government can control and monitor.

The United States has an extradition treaty with the Bahamas that will allow the US to seek extradition but there are likely a few legal hurdles to overcome before that happens.

Whether he is granted bail pending the extradition will be one of those questions likely answered at the hearing.He had been due to speak on Tuesday before US lawmakers, “calling in” from the Bahamas to a hearing before the House financial services committee.In a statement, Congresswoman Maxine Waters who chairs the committee said she was disappointed Mr Bankman-Fried would no longer be appearing at the hearing.“Although Mr Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr Bankman-Fried about the actions that have harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,” she said. “The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.”One of the most confusing parts of the saga is that Mr Bankman-Fried has spoken to the media and made other public appearances to talk about what has happened to FTX, in a move that would appear to go against the advice most lawyers would give to their clients.It is one of the questions that would have no doubt been raised by US lawmakers in the hearing on Tuesday.However, FTX’s new CEO, John Ray III, is scheduled to appear. He referred to FTX as an “unprecedented and complete failure of corporate controls” the likes of which he has not witnessed in his 40-year career.What will the arrest mean for investors?The bankruptcy process under way with FTX and its associated companies will continue in parallel as the legal case against Mr Bankman-Fried progresses. Individual customers are said to be owed up to $1m by FTX.In his many public appearances since FTX’s collapse, Mr Bankman-Fried has talked about making customers whole and finding ways to repay them for their investment losses. - The Guardian",2022-12-13

The former CEO of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange, dressed in a blue suit without a tie, lowered his head and hugged his parents after the judge said his risk of flight was too ""great"" and ordered that he be sent to a Bahamas correctional facility until Feb. 8. The day's events capped a stunning fall from grace in recent weeks for Bankman-Fried, who amassed a fortune valued over $20 billion as he rode a cryptocurrency boom to build FTX into one of the world's largest exchanges before it abruptly collapsed this year. In an indictment unsealed on Tuesday morning, U.S. prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX's customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for expenses and debts and to make investments on behalf of his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC. He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing false and misleading information about the hedge fund's condition, and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said. They accused Bankman-Fried of using the stolen money to make ""tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions."" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in New York said that the investigation was ""ongoing"" and ""moving quickly."" ""While this is our first public announcement, it will not be our last,"" he said. Williams described the collapse as one of the ""biggest financial frauds in American history."" Prior to his arrest, Bankman-Fried, who founded FTX in 2019, was an unconventional figure who sported wild hair, t-shirts and shorts on panel appearances with statesmen like former U.S. President Bill Clinton. He became one of the largest Democratic donors, contributing $5.2 million to President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at $26.5 billion. ""You can commit fraud in shorts and t-shirts in the sun. That's possible,"" attorney Williams told reporters. Bankman-Fried has previously apologized to customers and acknowledged oversight failings at FTX, but said he does not personally think he has any criminal liability. He faces up to 115 years in prison if convicted on all eight counts, prosecutors said, though any sentence would depend on a range of factors. Williams declined to say whether prosecutors would bring charges against other FTX executives and whether any FTX insiders were cooperating with the investigation. Both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed suit on Tuesday. The CFTC sued Bankman-Fried, Alameda and FTX, alleging fraud involving digital commodity assets. Since at least May 2019, FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from equity investors in a years-long ""brazen, multi-year scheme"" in which Bankman-Fried concealed FTX was diverting customer funds to Alameda Research, the SEC alleged. Tuesday's court hearing in The Bahamas, where FTX is based and where Bankman-Fried was arrested at his gated community in the capital, marked his first in-person public appearance since the cryptocurrency exchange's collapse. Bankman-Fried appeared relaxed when he arrived at the heavily guarded Bahamas court. He told the court he could fight extradition to the United States. Bahamian prosecutors had asked that Bankman-Fried be denied bail if he fights extradition. ""Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,"" his lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, said in an earlier statement. Bankman-Fried is expected to appear in court again in the Bahamas on Feb. 8. FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, leaving an estimated 1 million customers and other investors facing losses in the billions of dollars. The collapse reverberated across the crypto world and sent bitcoin and other digital assets plummeting. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX's CEO the same day as the bankruptcy filing. FTX's liquidity crunch came after he secretly used $10 billion in customer funds to support his proprietary trading firm Alameda, Reuters has reported. At least $1 billion in customer funds had vanished. The collapse was one of a series of bankruptcies in the crypto industry this year as digital asset markets tumbled from 2021 peaks. A crypto exchange is a platform on which investors can trade digital tokens such as bitcoin. FTX's current CEO, John Ray, told lawmakers that FTX lost $8 billion of client money, saying the company showed ""absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced, nonsophisticated individuals."" As legal challenges mount, U.S. Congress is looking at crafting legislation to rein in the loosely regulated industry. FTX has shared findings with the SEC and U.S. prosecutors, and is investigating whether Bankman-Fried's parents were involved in the operation.",2022-12-13

The leadership opted early on to suppress the story in its recommendation algorithms and then blocked links to it—saying that this was under the company's policy on hacked materials.  US President Joe Biden talks to his son, Hunter Biden, while shopping in Nantucket, Massachusetts, on November 25, 2022. Inset, Twitter CEO Elon Musk. The billionaire has teased new revelations about the social media platform's handling of the Hunter Biden's laptop story, which fueled much speculation and controversy. Getty What do the ""Twitter Files"" say?According to Taibbi's thread, the decision to block the article was made with Vijaya Gadde, former head of legal, public policy & trust and safety at Twitter, playing a key role.But in one screenshot, former U.S. policy communication manager Trenton Kennedy wrote that he was ""struggling to understand the policy basis for marking this as unsafe.""The decision was said to have been based on what several of Taibbi's sources called a ""general warning from federal law enforcement"" about the possibility of the Post article stemming from foreign interference. The story was originally dismissed by several Democrats in 2020 as a ""Russian disinformation operation,"" but as Newsweek previously reported, there has so far been no evidence to support these claims.Taibbi's thread also showed screenshots of Biden's campaign team requesting that the company ""review"" specific tweets in 2020. The report says that such requests from outside sources, whether celebrities or political organizations, became ""routine"" as Twitter attempted to combat issues like misinformation on its site.Taibbi also noted that both Republicans and Democrats ""had access to these tools,"" further claiming that ""the system wasn't balanced,"" and that there were ""more channels open to the left.""A second and additional sets of ""Twitter files"" have since been released in collaboration with journalist Bari Weiss. However, these files (unlike Taibbi's edition) were focused on content moderation and historical decisions to limit the reach of certain accounts, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and the anti-trans group Libs of TikTok. Weiss teased the release of further information by Taibbi, but with no release date or details about the content. In any case, the new set of files, released December 9, 2022 and over the following days, do not speak directly or tangentially to the Hunter Biden laptop story.A number of media outlets described Taibbi's first thread of files in underwhelming terms. A Poynter Institute opinion piece about the story was headlined ""Deal or no deal? File 'Twitter Files' under M for meh"".

Trump's ""major announcement"" sparks speculation about VP pick, lawsuit Taibbi's former employer, Rolling Stone, characterized the revelations as a ""Snoozefest"" while a parody article about the release by the satirical website The Onion included the subheading ""Sometimes Secret Stuff Is Actually Really Boring.""Right-wing commentators criticized the reveal too. Sebastian Gorka, a former advisor to President, Donald Trump, said he was ""deeply underwhelmed"" by Taibbi's thread.It has nonetheless incensed some conservatives.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said it demonstrated that ""Democrats were fully in on weaponizing Big Tech!"" Former Republican candidate Shukri Abdirahman caused controversy when she called for ""bullets"" and not ""ballots"" to fight ""tyranny"" in response to Taibbi's thread.Other journalists argued that its release played well in conspiratorial communities. As covered by Wired, one message by a QAnon influencer, seen on Telegram by more than 131,000 users, stated: ""The #TwitterFiles lay out a paper trail that confirms there was malevolent coordination from these entities to carry out operations that assist the DNC in elections. The Twitter Files confirm Q's entire main narrative.""  Elon Musk helped hype the release of the ""Twitter files"", which exposed communications between the social media platform and politicians in 2020.  Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty A media cover-up?Many (including Musk) also poured scorn on the New York Times in particular for a lack of coverage, heightening the idea that ""liberal"" media was attempting to cover up the story, including the Taibbi revelations.But the cover-up narrative itself lacks important context; while some media outlets indeed delayed the publication of the story, there were other factors beyond suspicion that may have informed that hesitancy.Those include the challenges of verifying the leaked information independently, or potential legal repercussions (especially in light of criticism aimed at mainstream media for the coverage of Hillary Clinton emails leak in 2016, or the Steele Dossier in 2017).The Washington Post said they had repeatedly asked Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani and ex-White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon for a copy of the data to review before the 2020 election which, reportedly, they were denied.It wasn't just left-leaning organizations that had concerns about the laptop either. Indeed, according to The New York Times, staff at the New York Post expressed doubts about the story.The article claimed Post reporters withheld their bylines and that according to sources at the tabloid: ""Many Post staff members questioned whether the paper had done enough to verify the authenticity of the hard drive's contents.""A spokesman for the Post responded: ""The story was vetted and The Post stands by its reporting.""Another article by Mediaite also claimed that sources close to Fox News had told it that the Murdoch-owned broadcaster had passed on the story too, citing ""the lack of authentication of Hunter Biden's alleged laptop, combined with established concerns about Giuliani as a reliable source and his desire for unvetted publication.""Mediaite also noted how former Fox anchor Chris Wallace and current anchor Bret Baier had voiced their initial skepticism publicly. As it stands, the ""Twitter files"" have been seen by many on the left and some on the right as a somewhat anticlimactic second act in the broader threads surrounding Hunter Biden's private communications and data, which have variously focused on business dealings of the Biden family with Ukrainian businessmen and Chinese firms, along with more sordid glimpses into Hunter's personal life.The conversation surrounding the release of these emails was talked up, particularly by Musk, who sent a series of tweets in the lead up, receiving hundreds of thousands of engagements.One message by Musk read: ""What really happened with the Hunter Biden story suppression by Twitter will be published on Twitter at 5pm ET!"" followed by ""This will be awesome."" He added a popcorn emoji.However, upon release of the files, their impact was arguably limited, and their contents less revelatory than anticipated.It showed both Democrats and Republicans had access to Twitter's reviewal tools, Taibbi stating that: ""By 2020, requests from connected actors to delete tweets were routine. One executive would write to another: 'More to review from the Biden team.' The reply would come back: 'Handled.'""Although the release also showed Twitter's internal engagement with the Hunter Biden laptop story, and Taibbi claims there was evidence of left-wing bias, the response in the company was not uniformly in favor of suppression.As was previously mentioned, an alleged email regarding the New York Post's story attributed to former Twitter communications official Trenton Kennedy, stated: ""I'm struggling to understand the policy basis for marking this unsafe, and I think the best explainability argument for this externally would be that we're waiting to understand if this story is the result of hacked material.""We'll face hard questions on this if we don't have some kind of solid reasoning for marking the link unsafe.""However one assesses their significance and impact, the ""Twitter files"" provide additional context and detail to the Hunter Biden laptop story, a chronicle that has lasted more than two years and may yet threaten to further undermine Joe Biden's White House and his presidential legacy.With that in mind, Newsweek explored the circumstances leading up to the most recent data dumps and what it means for the future of this story.  Hunter Biden speaks at an award ceremony on April 12, 2016, in Washington, D.C. A new release of emails from Twitter employees, sent as the New York Post's story on Hunter Biden's laptop was published, have been labeled both extraordinary and inconsequential. Paul Morigi/Getty Images for World Food Program USA The story so farThe story began in October 2020, after a laptop, delivered to a hardware shop in Delaware by a man who identified himself as Hunter Biden, came into the possession of the New York Post.A copy of the laptop's content was saved by the store's owner before the laptop was passed onto the FBI.By then a copy of the information was passed on to Robert Costello, Rudy Giuliani's attorney, and he in turn forwarded to the New York Post, which ran a number of stories about its contents.Speaking to The New York Times, Giuliani said the documents were handed over to the Post because ""either nobody else would take it, or if they took it, they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out.""Costello told Newsweek in an email that he has ""always had the original copy of Hunter Biden's hard drive in [his] possession.""""I obtained the original hard drive directly from John Paul Mac Issac in late August 2020. I provided the copies to Mayor Giuliani.""The New York Post was given a copy as an ""exclusive,"" which is why the hard drive wasn't shared initially with other media outlets.""The Post published what it claimed were emails showing that an adviser to Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, emailed Hunter in May 2014 asking Hunter for ""advice on how you could use your influence"" to aid the company. At the time, Burisma's president was under investigation by Ukraine's then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin.Although the 2014 email is not specifically referenced in its investigation, two computer security experts, asked to verify the contents of the laptop for The Washington Post, confirmed the veracity of ""a batch of messages from Vadym Pozharskyi"" in a portable hard drive said to have originated from Hunter Biden's laptop.On April 17, 2015, Pozharskyi emailed Hunter to thank him for connecting him with his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden.""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,"" the email read.About eight months after the email, during Joe Biden's December 2015 trip to Kyiv, the then-vice president pressured Ukraine's president and prime minister to fire Viktor Shokin.During a 2018 interview with the Council on Foreign Affairs, Joe Biden recalled telling Ukrainian leadership that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees until Shokin was removed. ""I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion,"" he said.""I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""As other reporting at the time and since has indicated, there have been far-reaching and lingering concerns about Shokin's apparent failure to pursue corruption in Ukraine that predated the Hunter affair, with his eventual departure welcomed by America's European allies.Shokin was accused by opponents of blocking probes into his allies, accusations he denied, and he was removed from his post after a parliament vote in 2016.As previously mentioned, while the laptop story was picked up by right-leaning media outlets, other journalists claimed they were not given copies of the data, only examining it after it was passed to them separately, at which point they undertook their own verification efforts.Twitter blocked users from sharing the New York Post article, containing information whose veracity was still under scrutiny by some outlets, saying it violated its company's private information rules and Hacked Materials Policy.It also froze the New York Post's Twitter account after the story was published, removing its restrictions on October 30, 2020.The block on sharing the article only lasted two days. Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey went on to tweet that his company's ""communications around our actions on the @nypost article was not great. And blocking URL sharing via tweet or DM with zero context as to why we're blocking: unacceptable.""  Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey pictured during the Bitcoin 2021 Convention in Miami, Florida on June 4, 2021. Getty/MARCO BELLO/AFP While The Washington Post claimed it was not given the data upon request initially, both the New York Times and the Washington Post were later given access to data.Costello told Newsweek that while Giuliani himself did not communicate with the Washington Post, he (Costello) spoke to Tom Hamburger (a WaPo reporter) himself numerous times.According to the newspaper, they were eventually provided a copy in June 2021 by Jack Maxey, ""an activist who received a copy from Giuliani in 2020, at a time when Maxey was working with Bannon and his 'War Room' podcast,"" an account that was partially corroborated by Giuliani's lawyer.""Hamburger and Washington Post received an alleged copy of the Hunter hard drive from Jack Maxey. I cannot verify whatever Maxey provided,"" Costello said.""Maxey obtained his copy from Steve Bannon's office - how exactly I do not know.""Newsweek has contacted representatives of Steve Bannon for comment.However, the Washington Post said at the time it was only able to verify a fraction of the emails which were reportedly found on the computer, and also said that ""others had accessed the data to examine its contents and make copies of files,"" which undermined the authenticators' attempts to ""determine the authenticity of most of the drive's contents.""The newspaper said its analysis authenticated some of the email communications (including the emails to Hunter Biden from Pozharskyi about the meeting with Joe Biden).The New York Times said separately, the week after the New York Post story, that it, alongside The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, had ""not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the evidence cited by The Post.""In March 2022, the Times acknowledged the authenticity of some of the contents of the laptop in an article about the federal investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs, stating ""emails were obtained by the New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop.""The Times added: ""The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.""Some of those emails, the Times said, included communications with business partner Devon Archer about Burisma.Newsweek has reached out to Chris Clark—a lawyer for Hunter Biden—and Burisma for comment.The Biden Administration continues to say that Joe Biden never spoke to his son about overseas business dealings.What happened to the laptop?'Further claims have been advanced that the FBI otherwise came out ""lying"" that the laptop was linked to Russian disinformation efforts.One tweet, sent by Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH) on July 27, 2022, stated the FBI had been ""lying"" about the laptop's content being disinformation. In a segment for his ""Tucker Carlson Originals"" series, Fox News host Tucker Carlson also said the FBI ""lied"" to Twitter, Facebook, and Google by ""telling them the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation.""But this overstates what the available evidence currently shows. In evidence sent by Facebook to a Senate Judiciary Committee in December 2020, the social media company said that ""the FBI also privately warned tech companies to be on high alert for the potential of hack-and-leak operations carried out by foreign actors"" in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election.Although this ultimately led to Facebook's decision to slow the spread of the laptop allegations, the social media company did not say it was warned explicitly about that story; the warning was general.Asked by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing whether FBI made contact about the Hunter Biden story, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said ""not about that story specifically.""The laptop had by this point been in the FBI's possession for nearly a year, but, beyond the timing, which plays into suspicions, Newsweek could find no evidence made public that supports claims the FBI's communications with social media companies were deliberately aimed at directing attention away from the story specifically.A Public Service Announcement published by the FBI on September 22, 2020, titled ""Foreign Actors and Cybercriminals Likely to Spread Disinformation Regarding 2020 Election Results,"" warned about a range of potential threats beyond the spread of ""false information"" on social media.""Foreign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites, change existing websites, and create or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt to discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions,"" the warning stated.""Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and announce elections' results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression, cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud, and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections' illegitimacy.""Furthermore, the aforementioned co-signed letter from 50 intelligence experts and directors stated that while there was concern that the laptop had the potential to be linked to Russian disinformation efforts, it did not say that the existence or (at least some) contents of the laptop were not genuine.""We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not, and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement—just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case,"" the letter said.The letter also stated that if the laptop reveal were part of a Russian disinformation effort it would be ""consistent with Russian objectives...to create political chaos in the United States and to deepen political divisions here but also to undermine the candidacy of former Vice President Biden and thereby help the candidacy of President Trump.""This was key to the story's popularity: The notion that the laptop's contents were sufficiently credible to open the path to a second presidential term for Trump. Therefore, efforts to suppress its contents were presented as evidence of collusion between liberal media, politicians, and intelligence agencies.

Fact Check: Did Stephen Curry sink 5 full-court shots in a row?   Fact Check: Did Lauren Boebert say Donald Trump hadn't paid any taxes? But further analysis has raised doubts over suggestions by Trump supporters that the laptop story may have been enough to end Biden's bid for the White House.Reports, including by the Washington Post, have stated that exit polling in 2020 showed that the central motivator for Biden voters was their opposition to Trump.Based on two national surveys by Pew Research Center of 12,751 adults, 56 percent of Biden supporters cited their opposition to Trump as the reason they supported him. For comparison, the second most-mentioned reason (""Leadership/performance"") was recognized as a motivation by only 19 percent of that group. Unlike the exit polls, however, this research was published before the laptop story came out.Members of the Trump family, too, have helped to propel some misleading claims surrounding the laptop's investigation. In April 2022, Donald Trump Jr. said that the FBI had lost the device, based on an exchange between Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and FBI official Bryan Vorndran.In a video, Trump Jr. said: ""Oh my god, guys, you've got to watch this exchange. The head of FBI cyber has no idea where the Hunter Biden laptop is.""The claim was a misrepresentation of that conversation. An analysis by fact checkers Politifact said the exchange was not proof that the ""FBI lost or misplaced the computer"" adding that Vorndran said that he didn't personally know where the laptop was, not the agency had misplaced it.In a March 2022 report detailing its verification of the laptop's contents, The Washington Post said the laptop was ""in the hands of the FBI."" There appears to be no other additional evidence supporting the claim that the Bureau lost it either.What is already under investigation?More recently, federal investigators have announced evidence that suggests Hunter Biden may have broken the law.In October 2022, The Washington Post exclusively reported that investigators concluded that they had evidence of Hunter Biden's tax crimes as well as false statements he made while attempting to purchase a gun, citing sources familiar with the case, which Newsweek is unable to independently corroborate.The Post added that it ""could not be determined for this article whether the laptop and its contents were useful in the Justice Department investigation.""Newsweek has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.In response, Chris Clark said: ""It is a federal felony for a federal agent to leak information about a Grand Jury investigation such as this one.""Any agent you cite as a source in your article apparently has committed such a felony. We expect the Department of Justice will diligently investigate and prosecute such bad actors.""As is proper and legally required, we believe the prosecutors in this case are diligently and thoroughly weighing not just evidence provided by agents, but also all the other witnesses in this case, including witnesses for the defense. That is the job of the prosecutors.""They should not be pressured, rushed, or criticized for doing their job.""Will Republican-led Congress investigate further?House Republicans have said, since taking back Congress' lower chamber in the November midterms, that they are planning to open an investigation that will tie Joe Biden with the alleged finances and business dealings of his son.During a press conference on November 17, 2022, Rep. James Comer (R-KY) spoke about ""suspicious activity reports,"" or ""SARs,"" and said that they are documents a bank must file with the Treasury Department when a transaction is ""suspected to be related to money laundering or fraud, or other types of criminal activity.""In a statement sent to Newsweek, the White House Counsel Office labeled these efforts as ""politically-motivated attacks chock full of long-debunked conspiracy theories.""Though the formal investigation cannot begin until Republicans take charge of House committees when the new Congress meets in January, scrutiny of the Bidens' finances is likely to be intense.'Nothingburger' or trouble for the Bidens?Speaking to Newsweek, Dr. Julie Norman, co-director of the University College London Centre on US Politics (CUSP), said the investigation's launch was almost certain.""Joe Biden has managed to mostly deflect the story up until now,"" Norman said.""But that could change, not necessarily because of any big reveals about the business dealings per se, but more so if Republicans can show that Biden—or anyone in his administration—attempted to suppress the story.""Dr. Thomas Gift, founding director of CUSP, told Newsweek that it would be difficult to argue that House Republicans did not have ""legitimate"" grounds for an investigation.""Republicans will measure success by whether they can embarrass Joe Biden, pure and simple. They don't actually need to find evidence of legal wrongdoing, so much as they need to make the case for the appearance of impropriety,"" Gift said.""While there's still much we don't know about Hunter Biden's laptop, his overseas ventures, and any alleged connection to his father, it's hard to make the case that the investigation lacks a legitimate basis. Even if any finding doesn't rise to the level of one of Trump's many scandals, that doesn't mean 'there's no there there.'""Make no mistake: This is a political problem for the White House, and however it turns out, the media's failing to cover it as such to this point does raise questions about bias.""Gift added that coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal (or lack thereof) among left-leaning media organizations had additionally fomented distrust between media and the public.""It's certainly true that conservative venues like Fox News and Newsmax have given over-the-top coverage to the Hunter Biden story. But the main failings are among the 'legacy' media outlets that lean to the left,"" he said.""Much to their discredit, all refused to cover the story immediately preceding the 2020 election, and there's been very little effort to acknowledge that mistake. Even now, the story is only barely making headlines at places like the New York Times, and is often framed in a way that downplays the severity of the allegations or spins them as right-wing talking points.""Trump's scandals are on an order of magnitude larger than anything potentially involving Hunter Biden. But that doesn't make these charges any less serious. And if the media wants to understand why so many Republican voters are skeptical of their coverage more broadly, it's due at least in part to this kind of partiality.""Jordan Cohen, Executive Director for Communications at The New York Times, told Newsweek in an emailed response:""Dating back years, and as recently as last month, The New York Times has reported consistently and fairly on Hunter Biden and his personal and financial entanglements. We will continue to pursue this story and any newsworthy developments aggressively.""What's next for the 'Twitter Files'?Elsewhere, new allegations that Twitter Deputy General Counsel and former FBI general counsel Jim Baker was involved in vetting the ""Twitter files"" posted last week were also shared by Taibbi.Taibbi said on December 6, 2022, that Baker vetted the first batch of files ""without knowledge of new management.""Elon Musk announced on Twitter the same day that ""In light of concerns about Baker's possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today.""Newsweek has contacted Jim Baker for comment.  In this photo illustration, a phone screen displays the Twitter logo on a Twitter page background, in Washington, DC, on April 26.  Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images The authenticity of these claims or what Baker ""vetted"" has not been independently verified and it remains to be seen what other information Taibbi may publish following Bari Weiss' earlier thread.More Twitter threads have since been published, including one by Weiss (focussed on Twitter's removal of the Trump account, with no updates on the laptop saga), one by Matt Taibbi and another by author Michael Shellenberger.Shellenberger's tweets, published December 10, 2022 only mentions Hunter Biden's laptop in reference to the previous ""Twitter files"" releases.In Matt Taibbi's thread, published December 9, 2022, which is primarily about moderation policies surrounding Donald Trump and the January 6 riots, there are two brief references to Hunter Biden.There, Taibbi claims that former head of Twitter's Trust & Safety Division Yoel Roth said in a post ""about the Hunter Biden laptop situation...that Roth not only met weekly with the FBI and DHS but with the Office of the Director of National DNI).It included a screengrab of said post, which refers in a ""check-in"" to blocking ""the NYP story then we unblocked it (but said the opposite), then said we unblocked it..""The screengrab also mentions: ""Weekly sync with FBI/DHS/DNI re: election security. The meeting happened about 15 minutes after the aforementioned Hacked Materials implosion; the government declined to share anything useful when asked. - Monthly meeting with FBI FITF.""However, this exchange doesn't state what the interactions were with security officials, nor does it appear to be directly related to Hunter Biden other than the reference to the New York Post story. Newsweek has been unable to independently verify these messages.Tweeting at Elon Musk directly on December 7, 2022, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that all the documents should be released publicly in any future disclosures. ""If the goal is transparency to build trust, why not just release everything without filter and let people judge for themselves?"" he tweeted.""Including all discussions around current and future actions? Make everything public now. #TwitterFiles""Whatever new information may come to light from Twitter, Musk, House Republicans, or others about the Hunter Biden laptop story, there doesn't seem to be an end in sight for this saga or the flurry of speculation around it.Newsweek has contacted Twitter, the White House, Hunter Biden and the FBI for comment.

Bahamas Chief Magistrate JoyAnn Ferguson-Pratt denied the petition for Bankman-Fried to be released on bail, citing a ""great"" risk of flight and ordered the former CEO of FTX sent to the country's department of corrections until Feb 8. He had been arrested in the Bahamas on Monday. US Attorney Damian Williams in New York said Bankman-Fried made illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans with ""stolen customer money"", saying it was part of one of the ""biggest financial frauds in American history"". ""While this is our first public announcement, it will not be our last,"" he said, adding Bankman-Fried ""made tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions"". Bankman-Fried faces a maximum sentence of 115 years in prison if convicted on all eight counts, prosecutors said, though any sentence would depend on a range of factors. Williams declined to say whether prosecutors would bring any charges against other FTX executives and whether any FTX insiders were cooperating with the investigation. Bankman-Fried made a court appearance on Tuesday in the Bahamas, where FTX is based and where he was arrested at his gated community in the capital, Nassau. The 30-year-old seemed relaxed when he arrived at the heavily guarded Bahamas court. It was his first in-person public appearance since the cryptocurrency exchange's collapse. He told the court he could fight extradition to the United States. Bahamian prosecutors had asked that Bankman-Fried be denied bail if he fights extradition. “Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” his lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, said in an earlier statement. 'BRAZEN' SCHEME FTX's current CEO, John Ray, told congressional lawmakers on Tuesday that FTX lost US$8 billion of client money, saying the company showed ""absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced, nonsophisticated individuals"". In the indictment unsealed on Tuesday morning, US prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX's customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for expenses and debts and to make investments on behalf of his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC. He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing false and misleading information about the hedge fund's condition, and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said. ""We allege that the defendant conspired to defraud customers by misappropriating their deposits; to defraud lenders; to commit securities fraud and money laundering; and to violate campaign finance laws,"" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Both the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged Bankman-Fried committed fraud in lawsuits filed on Tuesday. The CFTC sued Bankman-Fried, Alameda and FTX on Tuesday, alleging fraud involving digital commodity assets. Since at least May 2019, FTX raised more than US$1.8 billion from equity investors in a years-long ""brazen, multi-year scheme"" in which Bankman-Fried concealed FTX was diverting customer funds to Alameda Research, the SEC alleged. Bankman-Fried has apologised to customers and acknowledged oversight failings at FTX, but said he does not personally think he has any criminal liability. CRYPTO INVESTORS LOST BILLIONS Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 and rode a cryptocurrency boom to build it into one of the world's largest exchanges of the digital tokens. Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at US$26.5 billion, and he became a substantial donor to US political campaigns, media outlets and other causes. A crypto exchange is a platform on which investors can trade digital tokens such as bitcoin. As legal challenges mount, the US Congress is also looking at crafting legislation to rein in a loosely-regulated industry. FTX has shared findings with the SEC and US prosecutors, and is investigating whether Bankman-Fried's parents were involved in the operation. FTX's collapse was one of a series of bankruptcies in the crypto industry this year as digital asset markets tumbled from 2021 peaks. FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov 11, leaving an estimated 1 million customers and other investors facing losses in the billions of dollars. The collapse reverberated across the crypto world and sent bitcoin and other digital assets plummeting. Bankman-Fried was an unconventional figure who sported wild hair, t-shirts and shorts on panel appearances with statesmen like former U.S. President Bill Clinton. He became one of the largest Democratic donors, contributing US$5.2 million to President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. The attorney general's office of the Bahamas said it expected Bankman-Fried to be extradited to the United States. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX's CEO the same day as the bankruptcy filing. FTX's liquidity crunch came after he secretly used US$10 billion in customer funds to support his proprietary trading firm Alameda, Reuters has reported. At least US$1 billion in customer funds had vanished.                    ",2022-12-13

During … [+26128 chars]",Politico,"     POLITICO Playbook: Alexandra Pelosi’s ode to her mother   By RACHAEL BADE, EUGENE DANIELS and RYAN LIZZA  12/13/2022 06:17 AM EST    Presented by      With help from Eli Okun and Garrett Ross              House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attends a press conference at the U.S. Capitol Building on Aug. 10, 2022. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images          DRIVING THE DAY  During an early 2020 congressional recess, in the heat of DONALD TRUMP’s bungled pandemic response, NANCY PELOSI listened from home as Vice President MIKE PENCE spoke on a coronavirus teleconference. The speaker did the laundry and tidied the bed as Pence spoke. Her husband, PAUL PELOSI, made food in the kitchen.“What is the point of this call?” her daughter, filmmaker ALEXANDRA PELOSI, asked, following her mom around with a video camera. “They’re checking a box,” Pelosi responded as she continued her chores.Pelosi then unmuted herself, sarcastically declared “this has been a useful exchange” and went on to grill Pence on how the administration was tracking how the virus was spreading before signing off with a cheery “Happy Easter!”She put herself back on mute and turned to her daughter: “Am I a bitch?” she asked.That’s just one of several memorable scenes captured in Alexandra’s new documentary “Pelosi in the House,” which airs at 9 p.m. tonight on HBO. We attended the premiere at the National Archives last night, and we were fascinated by some of the candid and personal moments in the nearly two-hour movie.Alexandra told Vanity Fair’s Charlotte Klein that her mother knew little about the film before the two saw it together last night. “As somebody who beautifully crafted her own career, I’m sure it’s gonna be very difficult for her to watch how she looks to her own daughter,” she said. “What’s she gonna do, sue her daughter? She’s not gonna sue me.”ABOUT THE FILM — First off, let’s be clear: While Alexandra Pelosi is a documentarian and the film is being presented by HBO as an account of “history in the making,” it is not a work of journalism. It’s a talented daughter’s flattering account of her mother’s life at the pinnacle of American politics, with all the narrative implications and ethical conflicts that implies.And it’s fair to ask whether, say, MITCH McCONNELL or a prominent conservative would get the same prominent platform had his child cobbled home movies together into a laudatory documentary.That said: The fly-on-the-wall footage captured in the doc is both completely captivating and historically significant.“Pelosi in the House” documents the two major roles that history will remember the outgoing speaker for: Her iron grip on the Democratic caucus and her role as Trump’s greatest foil.Yes, it documents all of her key clashes with Trump, from her meme-ready clap during his 2017 State of the Union address to her handling of the pandemic and two impeachments. Her disdain for the former president, unsurprisingly, drips through the screen: “He’s totally insane,” she says at one point.But the film is most compelling when it shows personal scenes — like when her grandson gets upset at the swarms of protesters encircling Pelosi’s house demanding she impeach GEORGE W. BUSH for the Iraq war — and unseen moments at key junctures in political history.It captures Pelosi personally whipping votes to pass the Affordable Care Act, poring over lists of members with a blue marker, summoning lawmaker after lawmaker to her office to twist arms, and telling Democrats who wanted a “pass” to oppose the legislation that they aren’t getting one.The film reveals a private conversation Pelosi had in 2017 with the late Sen. JOHN McCAIN (R-Ariz.) just before he walked on the Senate floor and famously killed the Republican push to repeal the ACA — as well as a subsequent call with then-Speaker PAUL RYAN after the bill to undo her policy legacy had failed, wryly suggesting they work together on health care.And during the 2020 campaign, Pelosi warned then-candidate JOE BIDEN not to follow the rest of the party in embracing unabashedly liberal policies. “Don’t go too far to the left,” she told him in a phone call. “We didn’t get here in the majority by going to the left — and I can say that as a left-wing San Francisco liberal. ... Let us win, okay?”Many scenes show Pelosi juggling her political life with workaday family matters. While Pelosi phones Judiciary Chair JERRY NADLER to prod him about upcoming impeachment hearings, her husband is in the background dealing with a broken garage door. Moments before the House votes on the first impeachment, she is seen fretting about her granddaughter’s birthday card.The documentary, of course, includes the footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6 first shared with the House select committee investigating the attack, and it runs through all the GOP’s attacks on the speaker over the years. It closes with a question from Alexandra: “How do you make peace with the fact that because of your work, people want to kill you?”“Being speaker makes you a target — a target of misinformation, a target of mockery and sometimes a target of violence,” Pelosi said, before quoting a favorite passage: “When one day I meet my maker … he will say to me: ‘Show me your wounds.’ …I’m proud of my wounds.”Good Tuesday morning.

SBF BEHIND BARS — Today’s House Financial Services Committee hearing on the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange will go on as scheduled without its star witness: Former CEO SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, who was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday at the behest of U.S. prosecutors who have secured indictments on a range of fraud charges.Panel chair MAXINE WATERS said in a statement Monday night she still wants to hear from Bankman-Fried, saying “the American public deserves to hear directly … about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many.” Current FTX CEO JOHN RAY III, a cleanup expert known for his work at Enron after its 2002 collapse, will testify as planned.“The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity,” Waters added. “While I am disappointed that we will not be able to hear from Mr. Bankman-Fried tomorrow, we remain committed to getting to the bottom of what happened.” More from NYTOMNIBUS LATEST — House Appropriations Chair ROSA DeLAURO (D-Conn.) is the biggest remaining obstacle to a huge government spending compromise that congressional leaders are circling, Caitlin Emma, Sarah Ferris and Burgess Everett report. Time is running short, but DeLauro said she’s “optimistic we can get to yes.” The Senate appropriations leaders have closed the $26 billion gap between Democrats’ and Republicans’ proposals, but “they’ve so far been unable to win DeLauro’s buy-in.”— Meanwhile, Congress has to pass a stopgap funding bill before Friday to avoid a shutdown and buy more time to negotiate the full-year deal. Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER indicated that he expects Congress to take up a weeklong extension in the coming days.

Among the names being mentioned: TIFFANY SMILEY in Washington, JOE O’DEA in Colorado, BILL G. SCHUETTE in Michigan, DERRICK ANDERSON in Virginia and departing Reps. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER (Wash.) and PETER MEIJER (Mich.). But some losing nominees may be eager to run again: BO HINES has already filed in North Carolina.INDEPENDENT SINEMA — Sen. KYRSTEN SINEMA’s decision to leave the Democratic Party places the DSCC in a possible nightmare bind for the 2024 race in Arizona, Burgess Everett and Marianne LeVine report. The party isn’t quite sure whether to back her in a potential three-way race. “Democrats are not eager to intervene at the moment, but at some point they may have to make a call about whether to support Sinema, back whoever wins a primary or sit out the race altogether.”MANCHIN IN THE MIDDLE — Reporters pressed Sen. JOE MANCHIN (D-W.Va.) Monday on whether he has plans to follow Sinema’s lead and leave the Dems: “I’ll look at all of these things. I’ve always looked [at] all these things, but I have no intention of doing anything right now,” he said, per The Hill. “Whether I do something later, I can’t tell you what the future’s going to bring.” As for potential GOP challengers Gov. JIM JUSTICE and Rep. ALEX MOONEY, Manchin told CNN’s Manu Raju, “Justice is a much better candidate, and he would be doing it for the right reasons. I think Mooney is doing it strictly for his political ambition.”EARLY-BIRD SPECIAL — Virginia Gov. GLENN YOUNGKIN on Monday set for the special election to replace the late Rep. DONALD McEACHIN (D-Va.) for Feb. 21 — but the real deciding moment in the heavily Democratic district is Dec. 20, when party leaders will hold a “firehouse primary” to choose a nominee. Yes, that is one week away.The Richmond Times-Dispatch’s Michael Martz runs down the field: State Del. LAMONT BAGBY quickly jumped into the race, and State Sen. JENNIFER McCLELLAN will announce her candidacy today, as could controversial, anti-abortion state Sen. JOE MORRISSEY; a victory for either could upend Democrats’ slim majority in Richmond. Other potential candidates include businessman/activist TAVORISE MARKS and former state Del. JOSEPH PRESTON.MIDTERMS FOREVER — As expected, a recount confirmed that Rep. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-Colo.) narrowly won reelection last month, per the Denver Post. The result confirms a 222R-212D split in the new Congress, pending the outcome of the VA-04 special.THE WHITE HOUSETHE AFRICA SUMMIT — At the U.S.-Africa Leaders’ Summit kicking off today, Biden has a tough diplomatic task with dozens of African leaders: make them believe the U.S. will compete with China as a diplomatic and financial support on the continent, Phelim Kine reports. “Biden’s negligible one-to-one diplomatic outreach with African leaders hasn’t encouraged a sense that things are changing,” he writes. “That puts pressure on Biden to deliver on his pledge in July that the summit will offer ‘new economic engagement.’”— Biden will announce a trip to several sub-Saharan African countries next year, Axios’ Dave Lawler and Hans Nichols report.— A notable inclusion at the summit: Equatorial Guinean President TEODORO OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO. He may be the longest-tenured dictator in the world, but Obiang is a prime target for the U.S. as officials try to persuade him not to let China build a naval base in his country, Foreign Policy’s Robbie Gramer, Amy Mackinnon, and Jack Detsch report.CONGRESSKEEP HOLDING ON — Sen.

The Georgia subpoena— Smith has also subpoenaed New Mexico Secretary of State MAGGIE TOULOUSE OLIVER, ABC’s Lucien Bruggeman and Laura Romero report.CANNON FODDER — “Judge officially ends Trump lawsuit over Mar-a-Lago search,” Roll CallJAN. 6 AND ITS AFTERMATHDEMOCRACY SIREN — Talking Points Memo’s Hunter Walker and colleagues obtained the text messages members of Congress and others sent to MARK MEADOWS in late 2020 and early 2021, which show some of the country’s most powerful figures actively scheming to overturn democracy and keep Trump in power. The texts, which Meadows gave to the House Jan. 6 committee, “offer new insights into how the assault on the election was rooted in deranged internet paranoia and undemocratic ideology. They show Meadows and other high-level Trump allies reveling in wild conspiracy theories, violent rhetoric, and crackpot legal strategies for refusing to certify Joe Biden’s victory.”Plus lots more on Rep. ANDY BIGGS’ (R-Ariz.) texts about overturning the election in Arizona and Rep.

Moyer  A message from Meta:   POLICY CORNERFED UP — As the Fed prepares to raise interest rates again Wednesday, central bank officials are starting to fracture over how intense the rate raises should continue to be, WSJ’s Nick Timiraos reports. “Some expect inflation to cool steadily next year and want to stop raising rates soon. Others worry inflation won’t ease enough next year, a scenario that calls for raising rates higher or holding them at that level for longer, boosting the chance of a sharp downturn.”WHAT MANCHIN IS READING — “Federal Deficit Widened to a Record $249 Billion Last Month,” WSJANTITRUST THE PROCESS — FTC Chair LINA KHAN is pursuing such an aggressive antitrust agenda that she now “wants to win unprecedented powers to review and potentially block any future deals by two of tech’s most acquisitive companies,” Microsoft and Meta, Josh Sisco reports from San Jose, Calif. If Khan’s FTC succeeds in legal cases, it “would be a radically new regulatory process compared to how they’ve done business in the past.”TALKER — “Biden’s Nuclear Waste Guru Out of a Job After Alleged Luggage Theft,” The Daily BeastAMERICA AND THE WORLDWHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN — China announced a new WTO complaint against recent U.S. restrictions on Beijing’s semiconductor exports, per the WSJ.MORE FROM WAPO’S FENTANYL INVESTIGATION — “They call him the Eagle: How the U.S. lost a key ally in Mexico as fentanyl took off,” by Mary Beth Sheridan and Nick Miroff in Mexico CityGITMO LATEST — “Military Plans New $435 Million Health Facility at Guantánamo Bay,” by NYT’s Carol Rosenberg.

David Goodman and Eileen Sullivan report. And that could just be a glimpse at what’s to come when the Title 42 policy ends next week.— As of Saturday, the Border Patrol’s El Paso sector had a whopping 4,500 migrants in custody, the Washington Examiner’s Anna Giaritelli adds.— California Gov.

Times’ Taryn Luna and Hamed Aleaziz report from Imperial County.THE FUTURE OF FUSION — Does this week’s reported fusion breakthrough herald the scientific path to our clean energy future?

The arrest took place before SBF was able to testify before the U.S. Congress about the collapse of the FTX exchange in early November.

Ads        Ads     Head of Binance, CZ, commented on this news, calling it FUD. However, investors began to withdraw funds from the platform – mainly Ethereum and ERC20 tokens – for fear of Binance repeating the fate of FTX and SBF. Over the past week, investors and traders have withdrawn roughly $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. @Cardanians_io stated that unlike FTX and Binance, Cardano is a decentralized network that does not have a CEO. Therefore, ""There is no one to arrest.""  SBF is under arrest. Chances are CZ will also be arrested as @Binance is accused of money laundering.

The former CEO of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange, dressed in a blue suit without a tie, lowered his head and hugged his parents after the judge said his risk of flight was too “great” and ordered that he be sent to a Bahamas correctional facility until Feb. 8.       The day’s events capped a stunning fall from grace in recent weeks for Bankman-Fried, who amassed a fortune valued over $20 billion as he rode a cryptocurrency boom to build FTX into one of the world’s largest exchanges before it abruptly collapsed this year. In an indictment unsealed on Tuesday morning, U.S. prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX’s customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for expenses and debts and to make investments on behalf of his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC. He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing false and misleading information about the hedge fund’s condition, and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said. They accused Bankman-Fried of using the stolen money to make “tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions.” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in New York said that the investigation was “ongoing” and “moving quickly.” “While this is our first public announcement, it will not be our last,” he said. Williams described the collapse as one of the “biggest financial frauds in American history.” ‘SHORTS AND T-SHIRTS’ Prior to his arrest, Bankman-Fried, who founded FTX in 2019, was an unconventional figure who sported wild hair, t-shirts and shorts on panel appearances with statesmen like former U.S. President Bill Clinton. He became one of the largest Democratic donors, contributing $5.2 million to President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at $26.5 billion. “You can commit fraud in shorts and t-shirts in the sun. That’s possible,” attorney Williams told reporters. Bankman-Fried has previously apologized to customers and acknowledged oversight failings at FTX, but said he does not personally think he has any criminal liability. He faces up to 115 years in prison if convicted on all eight counts, prosecutors said, though any sentence would depend on a range of factors. Williams declined to say whether prosecutors would bring charges against other FTX executives and whether any FTX insiders were cooperating with the investigation. Both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed suit on Tuesday. The CFTC sued Bankman-Fried, Alameda and FTX, alleging fraud involving digital commodity assets. Since at least May 2019, FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from equity investors in a years-long “brazen, multi-year scheme” in which Bankman-Fried concealed FTX was diverting customer funds to Alameda Research, the SEC alleged. Tuesday’s court hearing in The Bahamas, where FTX is based and where Bankman-Fried was arrested at his gated community in the capital, marked his first in-person public appearance since the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse. Bankman-Fried appeared relaxed when he arrived at the heavily guarded Bahamas court. He told the court he could fight extradition to the United States. Bahamian prosecutors had asked that Bankman-Fried be denied bail if he fights extradition. “Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” his lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, said in an earlier statement. Bankman-Fried is expected to appear in court again in the Bahamas on Feb. 8. ‘BRAZEN’ SCHEME FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, leaving an estimated 1 million customers and other investors facing losses in the billions of dollars. The collapse reverberated across the crypto world and sent bitcoin and other digital assets plummeting. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX’s CEO the same day as the bankruptcy filing. FTX’s liquidity crunch came after he secretly used $10 billion in customer funds to support his proprietary trading firm Alameda, Reuters has reported. At least $1 billion in customer funds had vanished. The collapse was one of a series of bankruptcies in the crypto industry this year as digital asset markets tumbled from 2021 peaks. A crypto exchange is a platform on which investors can trade digital tokens such as bitcoin. FTX’s current CEO, John Ray, told lawmakers that FTX lost $8 billion of client money, saying the company showed “absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced, nonsophisticated individuals.” As legal challenges mount, U.S. Congress is looking at crafting legislation to rein in the loosely regulated industry.  FTX has shared findings with the SEC and U.S. prosecutors, and is investigating whether Bankman-Fried’s parents were involved in the operation.

And the year’s near existential crypto implosion continued to reverberate more widely, with the world’s biggest crypto exchange Binance on Tuesday halting the withdrawal of major stablecoin USDC. Binance itself is awaiting the outcome of a series of Department of Justice investigations. Broader markets were more concerned with the first of the week’s big macro events – the release of November U.S. consumer price data. Headline inflation is expected to have dropped to 7.3% from 7.7% in October, with core rates ticking down to 6.1%.  Coming a day before the Federal Reserve’s expected 50 basis point interest rate hike, the CPI number will be difficult to trade on.  Some analysts feel any surprises from the release may not register until the Fed decision and guidance is out of the way – with that complicated too by Thursday’s policy meetings at the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank.        Implied volatility gauges were pumped up as a result.  Despite the S&P500 registering its best day of the month so far on Monday, the VIX volatility gauge hit its highest in four weeks.  Other markets appeared in more of a holding pattern. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovered around 3.60%. The Fed’s implied terminal rate is stuck just under 5%, even as futures markets continue to price almost a half percentage point cut from there by the end of 2023. With icy weather snaps across the Northern Hemisphere, oil prices firmed after their recent swoon – but Brent crude remains below $80 per barrel.  Despite the week’s big macro events, there was considerable  individual stock movement and deal activity on Monday – with Microsoft rising after news of a stake in the London Stock Exchange Group grabbed most headlines.  Rivian Automotive slumped more than 6% after the company paused partnership discussions with Mercedes-Benz Vans on electric van production in Europe. Biotech firm Horizon Therapeutics surged 15.49% following a buyout offer from Amgen, while Coupa Software soared 27% after selling itself to private equity firm Thoma Bravo.  Weber climbed 23% after the outdoor cooking firm agreed to be taken private by controlling shareholder BDT Capital Partners. Chip wars were also in focus.    The United States said it has spoken with its partners, including Japan and the Netherlands, on tightening exports to China of equipment used to make semiconductors. The Biden administration aims to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment, in a bid to slow Beijing’s technological and military advances. China is responding by working on a more than 1 trillion yuan ($143 billion) support package for its semiconductor industry, sources told Reuters, in a big step towards self sufficiency in chips and to counter U.S. moves. China stocks fell on Tuesday, as optimism over easing COVID-19 restrictions started to fade amid signs of a spike in infections in major cities including Beijing. Hong Kong announced that from Wednesday international passengers arriving in the territory would no longer face COVID-19 movement controls or be barred from certain venues. With one eye on widening labor unrest across Britain, the UK jobless rate rose for a second month and there were other signs that some of the inflationary heat in the labor market is cooling as the economy stumbles, including an increase in older people looking for work. But regular pay rose by a stronger-than-expected 6.1% in the August-to-October period, the biggest gain since records began in 2001, excluding jumps during the pandemic which were distorted by lockdowns and government support measures.

These findings were a part of the latest Transparency Report published by Coinbase on 12 December. The report covered one year of data from 1 October, 2021 to 30 September, 2022.

We also intend to provide some insight into law enforcement and regulatory trends around the world.” Coinbase to pursue bad actors Regulatory bodies from all over the world are requesting more information from cryptocurrency exchanges.

A copy of his testimony, obtained by Forbes, highlights that the disgraced CEO planned to blame the spectral downfall of his $32 billion empire on everyone but himself.SBF continued the same rhetoric about FTX.US, the sister company of the global cryptocurrency exchange, in his testimony. He claimed that the United States-based entity was still “fully solvent” despite it being a part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filed on Nov. 11. Bankman-Fried wrote:“I wish I had not clicked on a button on Docusign at 4:30 am, leaving some of FTX under destructive leadership.” He went on to blame the inclusion of FTX.US in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy on John J. Ray III, a restructuring lawyer who assumed the role of FTX CEO after the bankruptcy filing. SBF claimed that “American customers were protected, at least until Mr. Ray’s team took over.”Ray, on the other hand, has been very critical of the former FTX CEO and his management skills. In his testimony for the FTX investigation hearing, Ray has said that in all his years of working as a restructuring lawyer, he has never seen such an “utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever.”In the leaked document, SBF also blamed the inclusion of FTX.US in Chapter 11 on the bankruptcy law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. While Bankman-Fried himself signed the bankruptcy documents, he claimed the law firm pressured him to file Chapter 11 documents and wrote:“I have 19 pages of screenshots of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Mr. Miller, and others I believe were influenced by them, all sent over a two-day period, pressuring me to quickly file for Chapter 11.” SBF also attacked the general counsel for FTX.US Ryne Miller, accusing him of being part of the pressure group that wanted to include the U.S.-based entity in the bankruptcy filing. Related: Hours before his arrest, SBF denied being part of ‘Wirefraud’ chat groupApart from Ray and his legal aids, SBF was also going to blame Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for what he claimed was “a month of sustained negative PR on FTX.” He claimed that Binance knowingly signed the letter of intent to buy out FTX, but they “never intended to go through with the deal.”  ",2022-12-13

Also, they aim to protect users and participants in the digital asset space.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609691 = window.pid609691 || rnd;                 var plc609691 = window.plc609691 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609691;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609691 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609691++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc367529 = window.plc367529 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc367529:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_367529_' + plc367529;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 367529,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_367529_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc367529++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  Related Reading: Binance ‘Finances Remain A Mystery,’ Claims New Report As Criticism Grows Cryptocurrency regulation in some countries is becoming increasingly stricter.

Its level of future adoption, therefore, is more sensitive to changes in interest rates – or has a longer duration – than gold, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a research report Monday looking at the benefits of both assets in a diversified portfolio.In the last year came the “end of a decade of easy money” as central banks raised interest rates saw a sharp reduction in speculative positions in gold and bitcoin, the report said. However, gold is roughly unchanged year on year, whereas bitcoin is down 75%, in line with high-growth tech companies.Tight financial conditions are expected to be a drag on bitcoin’s user adoption, the report said, and this makes a repeat of the cryptocurrency’s strong returns of the last decade less likely. Volatility will likely remain elevated until it develops more use cases.“The development of real use cases is also crucial to reducing bitcoin’s volatility, but is by no means guaranteed and may take a long time to play out,” analysts Mikhail Sprogis and Jeffrey Currie wrote.Goldman says such conditions will be a smaller drag on the price of gold as it is a “shorter duration real asset with developed user cases,” adding that the metal “may benefit from structurally higher macro volatility and a need to diversify equity exposure.”The cryptocurrency’s adoption has been boosted by easy financial conditions, the bank said, with some investors more willing to “explore low liquidity, high risk/return options like bitcoin.” With tighter financial conditions expected moving forward, speculative interest in bitcoin is likely to decline.Bitcoin is more levered to financial conditions than gold because the metal has “developed non-investment cases today while bitcoin is still looking for one,” the note said, adding that BTC is a “solution looking for a problem.” The majority of bitcoin supply has not moved for over a year, which suggests that it is being held for investment purposes, the note added.Read more: Goldman: Regulators Should Protect Crypto Investors at the Point of Trust, Not the Blockchain",2022-12-13

Compliance protects both those who invest on and those who invest in crypto platforms with time-tested safeguards, such as properly protecting customer funds and separating conflicting lines of business.”  The SEC’s allegations come after Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Monday on charges filed by U.S. prosecutors. The federal indictment against him—which is anticipated to include counts of wire fraud, conspiracy, money laundering, and more—is expected to be unsealed by Manhattan prosecutors on Tuesday, according to the New York Times.Court documents filed by the SEC further describe Bankman-Fried’s alleged fraud as “massive,” in which he had diverted “billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.” They also said customers the world over “believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform.”“FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr. Bankman-Fried created by, among other things, touting its best-in-class controls, including a proprietary ‘risk engine,’ and FTX’s adherence to specific investor protection principles and detailed terms of service. But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “FTX’s collapse highlights the very real risks that unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose for investors and customers alike,” he added. “While we continue to investigate FTX and other entities and individuals for potential violations of the federal securities laws, as alleged in our complaint, today we are holding Mr. Bankman-Fried responsible for fraudulently raising billions of dollars from investors in FTX and misusing funds belonging to FTX’s trading customers.”Before his arrest, Bankman-Fried had been planning to testify remotely before the House Committee on Financial Services on Tuesday.

Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at $26.5 billion, and he became a substantial funder of U.S. political campaigns, media outlets and other causes.FTX's liquidity crunch came after Bankman-Fried secretly used $10 billion in customer funds to his proprietary trading firm, Alameda Research, Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. At least $1 billion in customer funds had vanished, the people said.Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX's chief executive officer the same day as the bankruptcy filing.The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, led by veteran securities fraud prosecutor Williams, in mid-November began investigating how FTX handled customer funds, a source with knowledge of the probe told Reuters.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately authorized charges against Bankman-Fried, which will also be filed publicly on Tuesday, SEC official Gurbir Grewal said in a statement.Ray is expected to tell members of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee that the cryptocurrency exchange had ""unacceptable management practices"" including the commingling of assets and lack of internal controls, according to prepared remarks.",2022-12-13

So it’s not just the [corporate social responsibility] people or the sustainability people or even the investor relations people—it’s the finance people.” That’s what Meggin Thwing Eastman, managing director and global ESG editorial director at MSCI, told me. MSCI is a provider of investment decision support tools, such as ESG (environment, social, and corporate governance) and climate products for the global investment community. I sat down with Eastman to discuss the company’s annual “ESG and Climate Trends to Watch” report. Here are some key findings: A is for Accountability Get ready to get very accountable when it comes to what you and your suppliers are producing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed mandatory climate-risk disclosure rule will launch next year if approved. It requires all filers to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions that occur onsite and are controlled by the company. Meanwhile, reporting Scope 3 emissions (those that aren’t produced directly from the reporting company but from the activities of its value chain), will become a requirement for some companies as well.  “If you as a firm have a net-zero emissions goal and include Scope 3, suddenly you’ve got to be working with all of your suppliers and your customers in order to get to that goal,” Eastman notes. “It’s much more of a network effect. I think investors and regulators both are understanding how intertwined the economy is with these relationships businesses have. And they see a lever that they can pull to get companies to influence each other.” The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, a global organization, has been making progress on a standard for Scope 3 financed emissions measurement and disclosure, Eastman says. MSCI has been using that methodology for clients who want to analyze their portfolio, but it’s also available to banks and investors directly, she says. “It’s just an estimation,” Eastman says. “But it’s shining some light on something that was previously completely dark.” She says a focus on “insured emissions” is also on the horizon. It would allow insurance and reinsurance companies to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions associated with their underwriting portfolios. “Insurers are going to be looking at the business models and the emissions footprints of the entities that they insure—not just their physical risks, or whether your waterfront property will be there in 10 years,” for example, she says.   New regulation MSCI ESG Research provides ESG data and analytics for about 1,700 clients worldwide, and provides ESG indexes, according to the company. “Regulators are increasingly looking to regulate businesses like our own, and other ESG and data ratings providers,” Eastman says.   For corporations, regulation is going into new areas. For example, “There’s a brand new law in the EU that is going to require all commodities products coming into the EU be able to prove that they were not produced in a way that caused new deforestation,” Eastman says.  There are also proposed updates to the SEC’s naming of funds rule, and “more stringent regulation in the European Union with the sustainable finance directive,” she says.  “So we’re seeing disclosure, categorization, and naming of funds and most banks are not prepared for that at this point,” she says.  Better boards New corporate board demographics could play a role in say-on-climate and other proxy voting trends, according to the report. “Companies are really needing to look at structuring their boards and their governance structures for a whole new class of problems and challenges,” Eastman says. “It’s about assembling the boards of tomorrow today. So we’re looking at things like, do they have climate expertise on the board? What’s the view of diversity, not just gender or race or ethnicity, but age, nationality, experience.”  There’s a lot of moving parts, for sure.   See you tomorrow.

Crude oil futures          CL.1,         +0.69%,        which reached over $130 in March, are now around $74. For the year, the front-month contract is down 2%, though that’s better than the 10% retreat for the S&P U.S. government bond index and the 16% decline in the S&P 500          SPX,         -0.70%.   Ever the contrarian, Kevin Muir of The Macro Tourist wonders if there’s an opportunity here. The former institutional equity trader said the fundamentals really haven’t changed very much. “Many of the bullish fundamental arguments are equally valid today as they were back in March, but the main difference is that market participants had previously pushed prices to levels where much of that good news was built into the price, whereas now, little is incorporated. Back then, we needed everything to go right (or wrong depending on how you look at it) for oil prices to rise. Today, we need much less,” says Muir.        Macro Tourist/Philadelphia Fed    Look at some of the reasons.         The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a seller through 2022, is now poised to become a buyer, to refill reserves.                  The U.S. dollar          DXY,         -0.05%       seems to have turned over. “It is doubtful that the USD will prove as much of a headwind to crude oil performance in 2023 as it was in 2022,” says Muir.                  Interest rates also are not likely to climb as aggressively as in 2022.                  The Fed’s survey of professional forecasters finds the highest probability that there will be negative growth over the next four quarters in the history of the index. “I like trades where there is a fair amount of pessimism baked-in. Often, they have a way of surprising to the upside,” he says.           But the main element of his oil thesis revolves around China. He says that oil demand there plummeted because of the country’s strict zero-COVID policies. He says the sooner China gets through a hard winter COVID-wise, the quicker things will get back to normal. “Although others view the China COVID situation as crude oil negative, I think they are looking too closely at the short-term picture and failing to realize the long-term positives. Come spring, the Chinese economy might be ready to take off and experience growth the likes we haven’t seen since pre-COVID,” says Muir. He does specify that he does not want to buy the front-month contract. “I have no desire to be exposed to the vagaries of OPEC meetings, China COVID developments or the further unwind of overloaded speculators. No, I want to bet on the long-term positives reasserting themselves in the next year,” says Muir.                     Macro Tourist/Bloomberg               Crude futures contracts 36 months out look like a “bull market that has paused, and is simply correcting.” He said he’s started a long position in the Dec. 2024 West Texas Intermediate contract          CLZ24,         +0.25%.

""We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open.""USDC has its value fixed at $1, and it is used by some crypto traders as a place to park their cash at times of high uncertainty or volatility.The stablecoin maintained its dollar peg Tuesday, while Binance Coin — a native token that is seen as reflecting customers' trust in the exchange — had slipped 5.12% to trade at just under $269 at last check Tuesday.

The report said Binance processed over $10 billion worth of illegal payments in 2022.In follow-up tweets Tuesday, CZ called on Binance customers to avoid acting based on ""FUD"" – an acronym for the feelings ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt"" that crypto bulls believe drive some traders away from the digital asset space.

Cohen, said in an earlier statement.‘BRAZEN’ SCHEMEFTX’s current CEO, John Ray, told congressional lawmakers on Tuesday that FTX lost $8 billion of client money, saying the company showed “absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced, nonsophisticated individuals.”In the indictment unsealed on Tuesday morning, U.S. prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX’s customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for expenses and debts and to make investments on behalf of his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC.He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing false and misleading information about the hedge fund’s condition, and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said.Both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged Bankman-Fried committed fraud in lawsuits filed on Tuesday.The CFTC sued Bankman-Fried, Alameda and FTX on Tuesday, alleging fraud involving digital commodity assets.Since at least May 2019, FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from equity investors in a years-long “brazen, multi-year scheme” in which Bankman-Fried concealed FTX was diverting customer funds to Alameda Research, the SEC alleged.CRYPTO INVESTORS LOST BILLIONSBankman-Fried, who founded FTX in 2019, was an unconventional figure who sported wild hair, t-shirts and shorts on panel appearances with statesmen like former U.S. President Bill Clinton. He became one of the largest Democratic donors, contributing $5.2 million to President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at $26.5 billion.FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, leaving an estimated 1 million customers and other investors facing losses in the billions of dollars. The collapse reverberated across the crypto world and sent bitcoin and other digital assets plummeting.The collapse was one of a series of bankruptcies in the crypto industry this year as digital asset markets tumbled from 2021 peaks. A crypto exchange is a platform on which investors can trade digital tokens such as bitcoin.As legal challenges mount, the U.S. Congress is also looking at crafting legislation to rein in a loosely-regulated industry.FTX has shared findings with the SEC and U.S. prosecutors, and is investigating whether Bankman-Fried’s parents were involved in the operation.The attorney general’s office of the Bahamas said it expected Bankman-Fried to be extradited to the United States.Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX’s CEO the same day as the bankruptcy filing. FTX’s liquidity crunch came after he secretly used $10 billion in customer funds to support his proprietary trading firm Alameda, Reuters has reported. At least $1 billion in customer funds had vanished.   ",2022-12-13

This bold DeFi lending protocol requires no deposit of extra crypto tokens as collateral for borrowing. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, cryptocurrency lending came as a means that allows investors access to their preferred tokens. However, they must deposit other crypto coins as collateral before borrowing the given assets. This will help curtail risks and losses for the DeFi lending platform.

The charges pointed to a long-running scheme, alleging that Mr Bankman-Fried and others crafted a plan to misappropriate the deposits of exchange customers to pay the debts and expenses of his private trading firm Alameda Research and to make investments. The conspiracy ran from 2019 – the year FTX was founded – until its collapse last month, according to the indictment.The criminal indictment was unsealed as US financial regulators brought civil charges accusing Mr Bankman-Fried of defrauding investors in his recently bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the first move in an expected onslaught of criminal and civil charges following his arrest in the Bahamas late on Monday.READ MOREWho wants to buy the Telegraph?

The regulator claimed Mr Bankman-Fried had taken active steps this year to hide the billions of dollars of FTX customer balances that were held at Alameda.“Bankman-Fried placed billions of dollars of FTX customer funds into Alameda. He then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank,” the lawsuit alleges.Before its collapse into bankruptcy last month, FTX had won the backing of several of the world’s best-known investors including BlackRock, Sequoia Capital and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.“The alleged fraud committed by Mr Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws,” Mr Gensler said.

In 2022, we’ve lived through high inflation, stock market lows, housing market frenzies and ongoing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Although we don’t have a crystal ball to predict what will happen to the economy next year, we could use this year’s events as a guide: Things may continue to be rocky.If homeownership and investing are on your 2023 goals list, here are some questions to ask yourself before whipping out your spreadsheet, money apps or notebooks.  WHAT AM I WILLING TO SACRIFICE IN TERMS OF SPACE?Whether you have a goal of buying a new home or renting a new place next year, there’s a lot to consider. For instance, 30-year fixed mortgage rates went from an average of 3.45% in January to 6.90% in October thanks to inflation and Fed rate increases. The Fed has already raised interest rates 75 basis points four times this year. This, coupled with housing shortages, has driven the national median price of homes above $400,000 for the first time, according to the National Association of Realtors. Homeownership may still be an attainable goal, but you might have to make some sacrifices, says Zaneilia Harris, a certified financial planner and president of Harris & Harris Wealth Management Group in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.      “You need to evaluate what you are willing to give up in space in order to own property,” Harris says. “You may have to gradually get to where you want, as opposed to just going straight into a single-family house.”This could mean starting off with a condo or townhouse and then using the equity from the condo to purchase your next property, Harris says.  HOW CAN I MAKE HOMEOWNERSHIP MORE AFFORDABLE?Another portal to homeownership Harris recommends is the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, also known as NACA. It’s a mortgage program that allows working people to purchase a home with no down payment, closing costs, fees or stringent credit prerequisites.Members can also buy their homes at a below-market interest rate. The program is currently in 28 states and the District of Columbia.Buying a home in 2023 could also be more attainable if you’re willing to get a roomie, says Jocelyn Wright , a CFP and retirement income certified professional at PF Wealth Management Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. This is something she did with her sister in 2017.“It’s not going to be forever necessarily, but this gave us the opportunity to have our own home, and we can leverage the equity and all of that going forward,” she says.  HOW DIVERSE IS MY PORTFOLIO?This year hasn’t been the greenest for investors — at the start of December, the S&P 500 was down more than 15% this year. The market’s volatility could understandably make investors unsure about how to move forward. Financial professionals say a diverse portfolio and taking the right amount of risk might be steps in the right direction.Keep diversification in mind, says Wright. Diversification is when you invest in a variety of assets to manage risk and market volatility. The FTX and BlockFi collapses that happened in November are a reminder about why to avoid investing too heavily in one area.“Unfortunately, a lot of newer investors were very excited about Bitcoin, crypto, (and) all of that, and forgot those lessons,” Wright says. “You don’t put your short-term money into the market, and those rules always apply.”Wright considers short-term money to be cash you’ll need in 12 months to three years.Instead of putting all of your money into the stock market, put the amount you’ll need in the near future into an emergency fund, high-yield savings accounts, a certificate of deposit or short-term fixed-income securities like Treasury bills, says Wright.  HOW MUCH RISK CAN I TAKE?Ask yourself how much risk you’re comfortable taking, says Harris. That depends a lot on your circumstances, but risk isn’t something to be afraid of when you have enough income, an emergency fund and a diverse portfolio, she says. And risk is worth it when you invest for the long term and can reap those long-term rewards.Harris says younger people who are further away from retirement can and should be willing to take on more risk. Harris, who identifies as Black, also says some people of color have historically been afraid to take on much risk, but she wants them to remember that risk/reward combo as well.If you haven’t started investing, or stopped investing due to money being tight, remember you can always invest at a pace that feels comfortable for you.“You have to invest and become comfortable with that, whether that’s biweekly, bimonthly or monthly,” says Harris.   You can always start with lower-risk investments if you want to play it safe. Some include I bonds, money market funds or Treasury-Inflation Protected Securities, also known as TIPS._________________________This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

A hearing on his extradition to the U.S. is scheduled for Feb. 8.The Manhattan panel indicted Bankman-Fried on eight counts: conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers, wire fraud on customers, conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders, wire fraud on lenders, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States and violate the campaign finance laws.""This investigation is very much ongoing, and it is moving very quickly,"" Williams said. ""While this is our first public announcement, it will not be our last."" He urged any business associates of Bankman-Fried to reach out to investigators sooner rather than later.""I would strongly encourage you to come see us before we come see you,"" Williams said.The indictment alleges Bankman-Fried knowingly devised the scheme to defraud customers of FTX by “misappropriating those customers’ deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research,"" his privately held crypto hedge fund, to make investments.$8 billion loss to customersThe wire fraud on lenders and customers started in or about 2019 and lasted through November, according to the filing.Gretchen Lowe, the acting director of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Division of Enforcement, pegged customer losses at more than $8 billion.But that number might pale in comparison to potential damage to public trust in the system, Lowe said.""The rippling consequences of defendant’s fraud are vast and have done significant damage to the integrity of the evolving digital asset market,"" she said.The indictment also alleges Bankman-Fried duped lenders to Alameda by obtaining money and property by providing “false and misleading information to those lenders regarding Alameda Research’s financial condition.” The indictment also accuses Bankman-Fried of campaign finance violations, alleging he conspired with others and made campaign contributions to candidates and political committees above the federal donation limit. His contributions to candidates for federal office, joint fundraising committees and independent expenditure committees aggregated to $25,000 and more in a calendar year, according to the filing. He is also alleged to have made corporate contributions to candidates and committees in the Southern District of New York “that were reported in the name of another person.” Seeking influence on both sides of aisle, feds sayThe ""tens of millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions"" were made to ""candidates and committees associated with both Democrats and Republicans,"" said Williams, the federal prosecutor.“These contributions were disguised to look like they were coming from wealthy co-conspirators when in fact the contributions were funded by Alameda Research with stolen customer money,"" he said.""All of this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington."" Separately, in a filing Tuesday also in the Southern District of New York, the SEC charged him with defrauding investors and enriching Alameda. The SEC said in a news release that Bankman-Fried raised more than $1.8 billion from equity investors since he co-founded FTX in May 2019, based in the Bahamas, and alleged that he “orchestrated a yearslong fraud to conceal” the undisclosed diversion of FTX customers’ funds to Alameda.He also allowed the undisclosed special treatment of Alameda on the platform, including a “virtually unlimited line of credit"" funded by the platform’s customers, and exempted Alameda from certain key risk mitigation measures, the SEC said.He then allegedly used FTX customers’ funds at Alameda “to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.”The SEC further alleged that Bankman-Fried concealed from investors “undisclosed risk” from FTX’s exposure to Alameda’s “significant holdings of overvalued, illiquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens.”“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said.Officials said investigations into other securities law violations in connection with the allegations of misconduct continue.The SEC’s complaint charges Bankman-Fried with violating anti-fraud provisions of securities law and seeks injunctions against future securities law violations, meaning if he is convicted, he could be banned from future securities trading beyond as an individual.The SEC said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is also charging Bankman-Fried.FTX CEO pledges continued cooperationAlso Tuesday, the company’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, testified at a congressional hearing on FTX’s collapse and missteps. Bankman-Fried was scheduled to appear at the hearing before his arrest. At the House Financial Services Committee hearing, lawmakers shared harsh criticism of Bankman-Fried with ranking member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., calling his arrest “welcome news.”Ray spoke about the issues that led to FTX’s downfall and said his team is cooperating with the Southern District of New York and SEC officials. “The FTX Group’s collapse appears to stem from absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company entrusted with other people’s money or assets,” Ray told lawmakers.Bankman-Fried was arrested after U.S. authorities filed criminal charges and he was taken into custody in the Bahamas’ capital, Nassau, shortly before 6 p.m. Monday.In a statement Tuesday, a lawyer for Bankman-Fried said his client is ""reviewing the charges with his legal team considering all of his legal options.""Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said in a statement that the country is continuing a regulatory and criminal investigation into the company’s collapse. FTX was once seen as the face of the industry, a company reported to be worth $32 billion that attracted celebrity endorsements and major sports sponsorships. Bankman-Fried was seen as a crypto wunderkind who graced the cover of Forbes and Fortune and had emerged as a major Democratic donor.But last month, after a crypto-focused news site published the balance sheet of an investment firm also owned by Bankman-Fried, FTX experienced the equivalent of a bank run: Customers and observers questioned whether its loans and investments were worth more than its debts. They also questioned whether the company could pay people trying to withdraw funds. In a matter of days, Bankman-Fried resigned and the company filed for bankruptcy protection. Speaking at The New York Times DealBook Summit on Nov. 30, Bankman-Fried said he didn’t “try to commit fraud on anyone.”CORRECTION (Dec. 13, 2022, 7:55 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated how much Bankman-Fried raised from equity investors.

Mr Gensler added that the charges for alleged fraud were a warning for other platforms to comply with US laws.The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against Mr Bankman-Fried in parallel actions. At a news conference on Tuesday, Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that the fraud Mr Bankman-Fried is accused of is among the largest in US history. In addition to accusing Mr Bankman-Fried of defrauding lenders, investors and customers, Mr Williams accused him of using ""tens of millions"" in ill-gotten gains for illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans alike. ""All this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington,"" Mr Williams said. Speaking to BBC News earlier this month, Mr Bankman-Fried sought to distance himself from accusations of illegal activity.""I didn't knowingly commit fraud. I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was,"" he told BBC News cyber reporter Joe Tidy.Mr Bankman-Fried also denied allegations he must have been aware that FTX's affiliated trading company, Alameda Research, was using FTX customer funds.He was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett. As recently as late October, he had a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (Â£12.1bn).A well-known political donor, he was arrested in the Bahamas and is being held there in custody pending extradition to the US. He said on Tuesday he would fight the extradition.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Sam Bankman-Fried denies claims he knew FTX customer money was used for risky financial betsMeanwhile, the firm's new chief executive, John Ray, told a US congressional committee that FTX's collapse appeared to be the result of it being controlled by a small group of ""grossly inexperienced, non-sophisticated individuals"".He said he had seen ""an utter lack of record-keeping - no internal controls whatsoever"".Last month, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US, leaving many users unable to withdraw their funds.According to a court filing last month, FTX owed its 50 largest creditors almost $3.1bn.The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.Cryptocurrencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities - often with a high degree of volatility.Their anonymity means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks, but their supporters say there is huge potential for innovation - and independence from governments.Billions investedSince 2019, Bahamas-based FTX had raised more than $1.8bn from equity investors, the SEC said, including approximately $1.1bn from about 90 US-based investors.It is alleged that while Mr Bankman-Fried promoted FTX as a ""safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform"", in reality he ""orchestrated a years-long fraud"" to conceal from FTX's investors the diversion of FTX customers' funds to Alameda Research LLC, his privately held crypto hedge fund.The SEC also alleges that he concealed FTX's exposure to Alameda's significant holdings of overvalued FTX-affiliated tokens.Mr Bankman-Fried is also accused of ""co-mingling"" FTX customers' funds at Alameda to make ""undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations"".In what has turned out to be one of his last interviews before arrest, Mr Bankman-Fried seemed extremely confident - telling me he would not be arrested and was innocent of any criminal wrongdoing.The 30-year-old turned up in his trademark shorts and scruffy T-shirt, seeming surprisingly calm.But he did admit he was not getting much sleep since his empire collapsed and he became crypto public enemy number one.Mr Bankman-Fried spoke to us not in his home, but in an apartment still owned by FTX, in the luxury Albany complex about 30 minutes from the Bahamian capital, Nassau. Before we started recording, we were told not to take any shots of the multimillion pound yachts or manicured gardens in the marina.We were also warned not to film his apartment building, which he has had to vacate for ""safety reasons"".Once we began the interview, Mr Bankman-Fried spoke for 35 minutes with no topic or question ruled out.As in other recent interviews, he admitted to mismanaging his FTX empire but tried to distance himself from any criminal wrongdoing.He also said he did not think he would be arrested and, off-camera, heavily hinted details would soon emerge to make the public more believing of his version of events.""FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr Bankman-Fried created,"" said Gurbir S Grewal, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.""But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn't just thin, it was fraudulent.""He added that FTX's collapse highlighted the risk unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose to consumers and investors.  The SEC charged Mr Bankman-Fried with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In New York, Mr Williams vowed that authorities ""are not done"" with the investigation and called on ""anyone who participated in wrongdoing"" to come forward.

The authorities also reportedly asked the former FTX CEO to transfer the new tokens to the control of island officials.The report also suggests that Bahamas officials tried to help Bankman-Fried regain access to key computer systems of the now-defunct FTX trading platform. According to American lawyers, Bahamas officials were “responsible for directing unauthorized access” to FTX systems in order to take over control of digital assets under the supervision of a U.S. court.John J. Ray III, FTX’s new CEO and restructuring expert, reportedly watched as someone minted new coins while he and his team attempted to get control of FTX’s computer systems, the report notes.The lawyers’ claims further escalate the conflict between FTX restructuring executives in the United States and officials in the Bahamas. According to U.S. lawyers, liquidators in the Bahamas asked a U.S. judge for access to FTX data controlled by their American counterparts, including trading data, email records and other information.“It is a request for live, dynamic access that would be provided immediately to the government of the Bahamas and to Messrs,” the lawyers reportedly wrote in a court filing on Tuesday.In order to support their accusations of alleged cooperation between Bahamas authorities and SBF, the American lawyers mentioned that SBF opened withdrawals for all Bahamian clients. On Nov. 10, just a day before FTX filed for bankruptcy, the firm said that it started to facilitate withdrawals of Bahamian funds, citing compliance with local regulations. The event resulted in millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency leaving the exchange.Related: Hours before his arrest, SBF denied being part of ‘Wirefraud’ chat groupWhile the new report brings more allegations of close ties between FTX and government officials in the Bahamas, other reports also suggest that SBF had connections with the U.S. government as well. According to some reports, SBF spent about $40 million on supporting Democrats during the 2021–2022 political cycle. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speculated that the amount that SBF actually donated to Democratic candidates was over $1 billion.The news comes shortly after SBF expressed interest in forming a new project in order to repay up to $50 billion to FTX’s creditors. The FTX founder was subsequently arrested in the Bahamas on Dec. 12. ",2022-12-13

The cryptocurrency's dominance rate, or the share in the crypto market, rose to 41.4%, the highest since Oct. 29. Historically, traders have piled into bitcoin, lifting its dominance rate during times of stress in the broader market.""Bitcoin's dominance has finally broken above 41%. Its a textbook de-risking market signal,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said in a daily market note.Bitcoin's dominance rate rose to over 41%. (TradingView) (TradingView)In addition, the pre-U.S. CPI gain of 0.5% in the futures tied to the S&amp;P 500, the benchmark for risk assets worldwide, likely helped bitcoin.The CPI inflation is forecast to have slowed to an annual pace of 7.3% in November, reaching the lowest since December 2021 and down from October's 7.7% increase, according to a consensus estimate by Refinitiv.Meanwhile, the growth in core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is expected to have slowed to 6.1% from October's 6.3%.A soft inflation print will likely bolster hopes for a so-called Fed pivot in favor of easing, bringing cheer to risk assets. The Federal Reserve has raised rates by 375 basis points since March to control rampant inflation and the liquidity tightening has ruined risk assets, including bitcoin.Bitcoin traders, however, are playing it safe, and perhaps rightfully so, as a hotter-than-expected CPI could dash the already elevated Fed pivot hopes, triggering broad-based risk aversion and flight to safety.""BTC futures open interest remains flat at $8.25 billion while funding rates skew negative. Traders are taking a predominantly bearish stance,"" Harland said.Open interest refers to the dollar value locked in the number of active futures contracts. The funding rate, charged every eight hours by exchanges, refers to the cost of holding bullish/bearish positions in the perpetual futures market. A negative rate implies bears are paying the bulls to keep their positions open and leverage is skewed on the bearish side.Griffin Ardern, a trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said traders are trying to go long on volatility.Traders typically go long on volatility by purchasing both bullish call and bearish put options. The strategy makes money if the underlying asset either surges or tanks enough to recover more than what was paid to purchase calls and puts.Bitcoin may see heightened price volatility, as too may market-moving events are lined up in the next 72 hours.""The central banks of the four countries – the U.S., Japan, European Union and the U.K. – will announce interest rate decisions this week. Plus, we have Powell's speech and the U.S. CPI release. The superimposition of many uncertainties will inevitably cause panic in the market,"" Ardnern noted.",2022-12-13

In Mackenzie, Iris Energy team members honoured those who have served by laying a wreath in the Remembrance Day ceremony. Future development sites Development works continued across additional sites in Canada, the USA and Asia-Pacific, which have the potential to support up to an additional >1GW of aggregate power capacity capable of powering growth beyond the Company’s 795MW of announced power capacity. Operating and financial results Daily average operating hashrate chart is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a6fd0c6a-86ce-4529-b3d8-d5eaeb2b997c Technical commentary The Company’s average operating hashrate was 1,445 PH/s in November 2022 (compared to 3,899 PH/s in October8), with the decrease primarily attributable to the termination of hosting arrangements during the month in connection with certain of the Company’s limited recourse equipment financing facilities as described above9. The corresponding decrease in Bitcoin mined (151 vs. 448 in October) and electricity costs ($1.9 million vs. $4.2 million in October8) were also primarily attributable to the termination of these hosting arrangements. The energization of the 30MW expansion at Mackenzie ahead of schedule, increases the Company’s total available data center capacity to 160MW, capable of powering approximately 4.7 EH/s of miners (via self-mining and/or hosting). The increase in the Company’s unadjusted electricity costs per Bitcoin mined ($12.6k vs. $10.2k adj vs. $9.3k in October8) was primarily driven by excess demand charges attributable to average unutilized power capacity (due to termination of relevant hosting arrangements as described above) as well as the increase in the average difficulty-implied global hashrate during the period.

If the above video doesn't play at that time, please refresh the page.)
The House Financial Services Committee is holding a hearing Tuesday morning … [+1660 chars]",CNBC,"This was CNBC's live blog covering Tuesday's hearing on the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX before the House Financial Services Committee.  The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing Tuesday on the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX following the Monday night arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas as U.S. regulators released a slew of civil and criminal charges against the one-time billionaire.The Justice Department and Bahamian authorities said Bankman-Fried, who was previously scheduled to testify before the panel, was arrested based on an indictment in the U.S. that was unsealed shortly after the hearing started.The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York charged the disgraced crypto executive with eight criminal counts: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations. John J. Ray, the company's new CEO and the panel's sole witness, told lawmakers the company had ""no record-keeping whatsoever,"" using bookkeeping software QuickBooks to track its multibillion dollar portfolio.""This is really just old fashioned embezzlement. This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose. Not sophisticated at all,"" Ray said in blistering testimony that lasted more than four hours. ""Sophisticated, perhaps in the way they are hiding something, frankly, right in front of their eyes. This is just plain old embezzlement. Old school, old school.""The company imploded and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month after reportedly transferring billions of dollars in FTX customer funds to Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, Alameda Research.The Securities and Exchange Commission also charged the former crypto ""darling"" Tuesday morning with allegedly ""orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX Trading,"" according to the agency.The Senate Banking Committee had also asked Bankman-Fried to testify at a Wednesday hearing that he previously refused to attend.Prior to his company's implosion, Bankman-Fried donated almost $40 million to candidates, campaigns and political action committees in the 2022 congressional midterm elections, with most of his publicly disclosed contributions going toward Democrats. Ryan Salame, the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, donated another $23 million, with the majority of his contributions heading toward Republicans.  Tue, Dec 13 20222:41 PM EST FTX CEO John J. Ray told the House Financial Services Committee that the cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried lied when he tweeted that the company ""has enough to cover all client holdings.""The since deleted tweet was published by Bankman-Fried on Nov. 7, just days before he stepped down as CEO of FTX and his company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.""Absolutely not,"" Ray said after committee member Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., asked whether that tweet was accurate. ""So that statement was false?"" Torres asked. ""Yes,"" Ray replied.—  Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 20221:21 PM EST Bankman-Fried allowed about 1,500 people in the Bahamas to withdraw roughly $100 million 24 hours before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while other investors were locked out of their accounts, Ray confirmed to lawmakers.Ray told lawmakers much was still uncertain, but ""what we do know is that the liquidation proceeding in the Bahamas was filed effectively hours before the chapter 11 proceeding. During that time period [...] the accounts were unfrozen just in the Bahamas [and over $100 million was released [to] approximately 1,500 customers in the Bahamas.""Court filings from Ray's attorneys at Sullivan & Cromwell provide more context for the brief window that gave Bahamian account holders precedence over other creditors.Bankman-Fried opened the window after Bahamian regulators pressed him about the crisis at FTX days before its Nov. 11 bankruptcy filing, which the company said on Twitter it was doing at the behest of Bahaman rules and its regulators.The Securities Commission of The Bahamas shot back two days later, saying it didn't direct, authorize or otherwise suggest that FTX prioritize the withdrawals for Bahamian clients.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 202212:14 PM EST Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, slammed a copy of Bankman-Fried's written testimony.""This testimony is so disrespectful,"" Rep. Cleaver said. Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify, but didn't show after Bahamian authorities arrested him Monday night. The fallen CEO planned to tell lawmakers he ""f*cked up,"" according to Forbes magazine, which posted a copy of his written testimony. The Missouri Democrat quipped that he couldn't even say the next two words as he read the script out loud during the hearing. Bankman-Fried said FTX's current CEO Ray and his team refused to return credentials Bankman-Fried said he needed to access to answer questions before the committee and of failing to respond to a number of emails.""Mr. Ray has never responded, nor has he reached out to me to communicate in other ways,"" the remarks say.— Chelsey Cox  Tue, Dec 13 202211:56 AM EST The Commodity Futures Trading Commission unveiled its own charges against Bankman-Fried as Ray testified about alleged wrongdoing at FTX. The CFTC's charges say Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, enjoyed access to as much as $8 billion in customer funds in an account nominally on FTX's books but controlled by and in the name of Alameda.From the very founding of FTX in 2019, the CFTC alleges that Alameda ""accessed and used FTX customer funds for Alameda's own operations and activities, including to fund its trading, investment, and borrowing/lending activities.""The CFTC filing echoes charges that the SEC unveiled earlier Tuesday, which said that Bankman-Fried operated his empire as a fraud ""from the start.""— Rohan Goswami and MacKenzie Sigalos  Tue, Dec 13 202211:42 AM EST U.S. prosecutors unsealed their indictment accusing Bankman-Fried of widespread fraud, a day after the fallen crypto exchange operator was arrested in the Bahamas on the charges.The indictment in U.S. District Court in Manhattan charges Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.Prosecutors allege in the indictment that the former billionaire was engaging in criminal activity that began as far back as 2019 and continued through last month.Bankman-Fried deliberately and knowingly ""agreed with others to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating those customers' deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research,"" the indictment alleges.It also accuses Bankman-Fried of conspiring with others to defraud FTX's lenders ""by providing false and misleading information to those lenders regarding Alameda Research's financial condition.""— Rohan Goswami and MacKenzie Sigalos  Tue, Dec 13 202211:38 AM EST Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., said Bankman-Fried, was lobbying Congress in order to keep the SEC from regulating the nascent industry.Bankman-Fried was a ""well-known figure"" in Congress and ""his one purpose was to keep the SEC out of crypto.""The disgraced crypto executive regularly met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill and was a prolific campaign financier, contributing nearly $40 million in publicly disclosed donations toward the 2022 midterm elections. The majority of his contributions toward federal campaigns were directed to Democrats.Bankman-Fried was recently arrested in the Bahamas. The SEC charged the former FTX executive with orchestrating a ""massive, years-long fraud"" in which he allegedly diverted billions of dollars of the trading platform's customer funds for ""his own personal benefit.Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York unsealed eight separate charges against Bankman-Fried, including several counts of conspiracy and fraud. They also charged Bankman-Fried with violating campaign finance laws.— Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 202211:25 AM EST FTX's troubles began ""months, if not years"" before it filed for bankruptcy, Ray testified.The crypto exchange had been intermingling its assets with Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, for a while, he said.""There was a public distinction"" between FTX.com and FTX.us, but in reality user data was amalgamated between the two,"" Ray testified. The crypto exchange collapsed after it came to light that Alameda had been using FTX customer assets to cover trading losses.""The owners of the company could really run free-rein"" between all of FTX international, FTX US', and Alameda Research's assets, Ray testified.""We've been able to secure over $1 billion in assets,"" the newly appointed FTX CEO said, but it could take weeks, even months to secure all of FTX's assets, he said.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 202211:16 AM EST Bankman-Fried recently said in an interview that all of his Republican donations during the 2022 election cycle went to so-called ""dark"" money groups.That move allowed him to avoid publicly disclosing which GOP leaning organizations he backed, he noted in a November YouTube interview with crypto blogger Tiffany Fong. These types of ""dark"" nonprofit groups allow donors to give an unlimited of money, without having to disclose their names.Bankman-Fried said he gave ""about the same amount"" to both parties throughout the recent midterm elections. If that's true, Bankman-Fried could have given close to $80 million between Republicans and Democrats during the 2022 election cycle. The now arrested FTX founder gave almost $40 million toward campaigns and political action committees in the 2022 cycle, with most those funds focusing on helping Democrats, according to data from OpenSecrets.Since that interview, CNBC asked Bankman-Fried over Twitter messages which ""dark"" money groups he supported and how much he donated to each organization. He never responded to those requests for comment.An ethics watchdog group has asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for alleged ""serious violations"" of election law, citing his admitted contributions of ""dark"" money to Republican-aligned groups during the 2022 primary season.— Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 202211:07 AM EST Federal prosecutors on Tuesday accused the disgraced crypto executive, who made nearly $40 million in publicly disclosed political donations in the 2022 election cycle, with violating multiple campaign finance laws.A newly unsealed indictment in Manhattan federal court says Bankman-Fried and others violated numerous federal campaign finance laws, including giving contributions of at least $25,000 to campaigns and political action committees ""in the names of other persons.""The charge, which is included among multiple other criminal counts against the fallen crypto exchange CEO, comes days after a private watchdog group asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate Bankman-Fried for campaign finance violations.— Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 202211:04 AM EST FTX's new CEO Ray told lawmakers the company used Intuit's QuickBooks bookkeeping software to manage its multibillion dollar portfolio.""Quickbooks?!"" Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., asked.Ray said the scandal at FTX was in some ways worse than the 2001 failure of energy trading firm Enron, which cost shareholders $74 billion and left 21 executives, auditors and other people convicted of crimes.""It's unusual in the sense that there's no record-keeping whatsoever [...] employees would communicate invoices and expensing on Slack,"" he said.""I don't want to speak to detailed regulations,"" Ray testified, but ""my basic observation is that you need records, you need controls, and you need to segregate people's money.""Ray specializes in recovering assets from bankrupt companies. He's most well-known for his work as chairman of Enron after its collapse. He helped Enron's creditors recover more than $800 million, which he's said was about 52 cents on the dollar.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 202210:45 AM EST Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, called Bankman-Fried's arrest ""welcome news."" Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Monday after the United States District Attorney for the Southern District of New York shared a sealed indictment with Bahamian officials.""He was scheduled to testify under oath before this committee day,"" Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said in her opening remarks. ""Unfortunately, the timing of this arrest in the eyes of the public the opportunity to answer this issue, that this committee will not stop until we uncovered the full truth.""— Chelsey Cox  Tue, Dec 13 202210:39 AM EST Sam Bankman-Fried is in Bahamian custody ahead of an anticipated extradition to the United States, but FTX faces regulatory probes that extend beyond U.S. borders.Regulators at the Securities Commission of the Bahamas have already begun to unpack the final, chaotic days at FTX with a likely eye towards charging Bankman-Fried.The Cyprus SEC had suspended FTX's European license just prior to FTX's Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing, but has complained that John J. Ray, FTX's new CEO, has stymied efforts at an investigation, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.In Turkey, regulators have already seized ""suspicious"" FTX assets with a likely eye to a deeper probe into FTX's operations there. FTX operated at least two subsidiary companies in Turkey.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 20229:20 AM EST FTX's new CEO, John J. Ray, will tell lawmakers about a $5 billion ""spending binge"" by former FTX executives Sam Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame in the months before the firm's collapse, according to a copy of his written testimony released by the committee Monday night.Ray took over as the FTX chief as the crypto empire hurtled toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Beyond the multibillion-dollar spending spree, Ray's written testimony confirms that customer assets from FTX were commingled with assets from Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund.""Many things are unknown at this stage,"" Ray's testimony reads.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 20229:04 AM EST Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler didn't mince words in charging Bankman-Fried with running what the agency said was a scheme to defraud investors, saying the crypto trading platform ""operated behind a veneer of legitimacy.""""We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,"" Gensler said. ""The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.""The one-time crypto billionaire was charged with violating the Securities Act of 1933, which basically prohibits issuers of securities from deceiving investors as well as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which regulates securities once they're traded in the open market.The agency said it's looking into more possible violations as well as other entities and people tied to FTX.— Dawn Kopecki  Tue, Dec 13 20228:32 AM EST U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said the Justice Department plans to unseal its indictment against Bankman-Fried Tuesday morning.The one-time crypto billionaire was arrested by authorities in the Bahamas after he was reportedly charged by the Southern District of New York with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.Neither the Attorney General of the Bahamas nor the Royal Bahamas Police Force would confirm the nature of the charges against Bankman-Fried.— Dawn Kopecki ",2022-12-13

So, it would be wise to take a close look at potential weaknesses, exploits, and built-in mitigations when it’s not too late for changes. But look beyond the code. Smart contracts are immutable pieces of code that perform certain operations in blockchain networks or link different blockchains together. The smart contracts ecosystem is on the rise. Sometimes, when new possibilities for rapid development flash before   the blockchain & cryptocurrency people's eyes, security is factored out. That can be a huge mistake.  I’d like to give rise to your interest in smart contract security and tell a few words about security audit so you know what to ask for. In this context, an audit means much more than just checking the code itself but studying interaction between contracts,   key management issues, operational security of developers who support the contracts, etc. Get the whole security picture with the audit. If properly executed it helps cut costs, risks of financial losses, and lots of other troubles.  Here’s what the process of a smart contract audit looks like executed in a team with security engineers: Speaking from my experience, many incidents result from several minor security weaknesses rather than one fatal flaw. So, in the beginning, it’s worth looking at smart contracts together with a larger system they belong to. Understanding and formulating   risks and unique threat vectors that affect the contract's consistency are also a must part of this stage. The next step is a real feast for those who like to keep up with recent developments. As the blockchain industry rapidly changes, to be in the picture security-aware teams must know recent real-world vulnerabilities, mitigations, and tools. Dig and explore. Armoured with the findings, we can move to studying design flaws and use cases. Learn what can go wrong. For example, our engineers at this stage check how the contract behaves, its entrypoints, offchain views, and the interactions between contracts. There   should not be painful surprises. Then it's time for more sophisticated work: reviewing of cryptographic design and implementation, security controls behaviour, infrastructure, and operations. This tedious work has to result in absence of security surprises in these areas. In the end, a   combination of cryptographic primitives and their implementation chosen by the developers must correspond to the desired security properties. Security controls must effectively work against reentrancy, replay attacks, denial of service, and leave no blind   spots and unhandled edge cases. Security and reliability of the surrounding infrastructure and operations should be verified and trustful. When all's done, developers get a long list of issues to work on. But what I like even more, they can get correction advice (ask for it if your audit team did not mean it) related to found issues and targeted at improving general code quality, maintenance,   and user experience. So, in the long haul, developers not only learn about weaknesses but understand how to eliminate them.  I hope you learn more about smart contracts security audits and how it helps to ensure transaction consistency in DeFI.     ",2022-12-13

The research sampled 5 million customers with checking accounts, 600,000 of whom had transferred money into a crypto account. Most new investors first fund a crypto account during spikes for Bitcoin price, according to the report.  Nearly 44 million Americans have ever transferred money into a crypto-related account, according to details shared in a new report by JP Morgan. In a report titled ‘The Dynamics and Demographics of US Household Crypto-Asset Use’, released on 13 December, the financial giant estimates that about 13% of the population has sent money to a crypto account. Per the bank’s data, involvement in crypto by the general population spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more money finding its way into cryptocurrency investments as individuals’ personal savings also increased. The report covered close to 5 million active checking account users, more than 600,000 of whom were shown to have transferred funds to crypto accounts. Transfers to crypto accounts tripled between 2020 and 2022 Cryptocurrency adoption across the United States has been steady, with other statistics suggesting similar adoption rates to what’s contained in this latest report. While JP Morgan says that only a tiny fraction of the US population was in crypto five years ago, its researchers found that the last three years have witnessed a huge jump in adoption. From the sample indicated, the banking giant estimated that crypto users in the US increased from a pre-pandemic population share of less than 3% to almost 15% by mid-2022. Of those to fund crypto accounts from their checking accounts, the research data shows a 300% spike. Cumulatively, only 3% of the population had transferred funds into a digital asset-related account prior to the pandemic.  That figure more than tripled in the last three years, with the trend seeing more than 43 million Americans, or 13% of the population funding crypto accounts. New investors increase when Bitcoin price spikes Another observation from the research is that funding of crypto accounts is that the transfers have largely come at a time when the price of Bitcoin is going up. Large volumes occur during bull markets or sharp rallies, with the trend going back to 2015, JP Morgan said. For most new users, the deposits span a few days and have coincided with the price of bitcoin seeing a trailing monthly change of +25%. It is this time that many people look to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Also observable is that most investors only make small transfers to their crypto accounts – less than a month’s pay. Indeed, the median transfer for the majority of investors is $620. Nonetheless, about 15% of individuals transfer more than a month’s worth of income. The share is even higher among high-income individuals.

It is used by investors to trade in and out of different cryptocurrencies without the need to move money back into dollars.“On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals,” Binance’s chief executive Changpeng Zhao tweeted on Tuesday at around 08:20 GMT.

DeFi protocols dominate as the main target of hacks.  The monthly value received by crypto scams is declining. The year 2022 was anything but boring. A stablecoin crashed, lending protocols vanished, crypto empires crumbled, and the harsh bear market settled.  Nevertheless, the use of digital currencies is evolving and keeps moving rapidly. But as the crypto space constantly changes, so does the criminal world. DailyCoin talked to Diederik van Werch, Director of Mid-Market EMEA at blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis on the latest trends in crypto-based crimes, why they occurred, and where they are heading in 2023.   Source: Web3summit.lt (Photo by Gediminas Gražys) Criminal Activity: Smaller, but Still Resilient Part of Web3In 2021, crypto-related crimes reached a record $14 billion of the total value transferred on the blockchain. The number is almost twice as high compared to the $7.8 billion of the previous year. Despite this, the share of all illicit crypto transaction volume was the lowest in five years. Since both legitimate and illicit crypto markets generated $15.8 trillion in transactions throughout the year, the criminal transfers represented 0.15% of all economic activity in the cryptocurrency space.  This is three times less than 2020 and 21 times less than 2019. But the decline is only one side of the coin. The other side marks a dramatic change in illicit activity forms and, most importantly, targets.  DeFi Dominates Transfer Volumes Increasing crypto adoption, institutional demand, more efficient smart contracts, and high-yield financial products made Decentralized Finance (DeFi) one of the crypto ecosystem’s fastest-growing and most attractive sectors. The volume of transactions on DeFi grew ten times over the past few years. The total value locked on DeFi protocols reached an all-time high of more than $181 billion in the last days of 2021. Once the dominant asset behind all crypto transactions, Bitcoin lost the leader’s position to stablecoins and smart contract-enabled coins, which transferred the highest volumes of value.    Source: Chainalysis.com  DeFi is the Leading  Target  (NYSE:TGT) of Hackers“This year, we have seen an unprecedented rise in hacks, specifically of DeFi protocols,” says van Werch.  According to him, more than 95% of hacks in 2022 happened on Decentralized Finance (DeFi), marking the continuing trend that started a year ago. In 2021, DeFi surpassed the centralized exchanges and emerged as an absolute leader among victims of hacks.   Source: Chainalysis.com The amount of funds stolen from DeFi hacks in the first half of 2022, $1.9 billion, has already exceeded the record of over $1 billion set in the third quarter of 2021.  Today, the total value stolen from DeFi protocols throughout the year is more than $3.2 billion, according to crypto data provider DeFiLlamma. In October, hackers implemented 11 attacks and stole $718 million worth of crypto from various DeFi protocols. Meanwhile, the total amounts stolen from centralized exchanges barely touched $250 million and kept a tendency to decline. ""Centralized exchanges were sitting on a large amount of crypto, and criminals got access to the private keys. Now virtually all hacks are happening on decentralized exchanges or decentralized platforms rather,"" says van Werch. Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) transferred more value than their centralized counterparts for the first time since the start of 2022. The surge in DEX activity took off even more after the crash of Terra (LUNA) in May 2022, making them one of the most active sectors and the dominant way of value transfers in the crypto space. Hackers Target Code VulnerabilitiesAccording to data provided by van Werch, at least half of DeFi hacks can be associated with code exploits because of the protocols’ open-source nature. “The reason for that is because the protocol’s code is public. It is very easy for criminals to spot if there is a vulnerability or exploit in the public code and siphon it off the platform”, van Werch says. Earlier this year, his firm identified code exploits and security breaches as the dominant attack vectors, responsible for the biggest percentage of funds stolen from DeFi protocols.    Source: Chainalysis.com  He further admitted that North Korea accounts for 60% of all DeFi losses of the year. North Korea-related hacker groups, mostly the state-sponsored Lazarus Group, stole about $1.9 billion worth of digital assets from DeFi protocols over the year’s first half.  The US Department of Justice alleged the Lazarus Group stole $625 million from the Ronin blockchain, which powers Axie Infinity. The hack implemented in March 2022 was the largest known theft of cryptocurrency to date. DeFi Exploited for Money LaunderingStealing funds through exploits is only one dominating trend of how DeFi protocols have been exploited over the year.  Money laundering has surged in popularity in 2022, making DeFi the main source of washing illegally obtained funds. “70% of all money laundering right now in the cryptocurrency space is going through decentralized platforms,” says van Werch. According to Chainalysis reports dated January 2022, nearly $8.6 billion in digital assets were laundered throughout decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and coin swap services in 2021. This is 30% more compared to the previous year, yet only 0.4% of the $2 trillion and $800 million of total value laundered annually.  Illicit World Benefits on the Lack of RegulationOne of the reasons why money laundering through the crypto space has become attractive to financial fraudsters is that DeFi protocols are decentralized. This means they are not obliged to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) rules.  Such regulations are mandatory on centralized crypto exchanges. As more and more crypto service providers adopt these rules, criminals are drawn to look for unregulated and more anonymous alternatives to move illicit funds. “I think this is because it is a nascent piece of technology, so the criminals feel like, “ok, they don’t have the same types of AML checks. It means that it’s much easier to launder their funds there,” says the Head of Mid-Market EMEA at Chainalysis. According to Van Werch, DeFi will continue to represent a high proportion of money laundering in cryptocurrency over the coming year. On the other hand, he believes that the numbers will eventually diminish as law enforcement agencies and investigators become more proficient in investigating illicit transactions on DeFi. “Key point to remember is that fundamentally the blockchain is open, transparent, and public. The blockchain itself is a fantastic tool to combat money laundering because every transaction is visible. Criminals might think they’re smart for using DeFi platforms, but there are always gonna be means by which we can catch them,” he assured. Crypto Scams DecliningIn post-pandemic 2022 the macroeconomic situation changed drastically. Russia invaded Ukraine, and energy prices correspondingly spiked, triggering inflation and restricted financial policies across the planet.  In the crypto space, bears took over from the wild bulls of 2021. Profits were wiped out and turned into losses. Crypto prices dropped, but consequently, so did the number of scams.   Source: Chainalysis.com  According to Chainalysis data, the monthly value received by scams in mid-2022 was $1.6 billion. This is almost 65% lower than a year ago. Furthermore, the number is the lowest in the past four years.  ""Scams are one of the most often types of cryptocurrency crimes. Those are on the decline right now. Last year, as we were in the bull market, scams saw a significant increase,"" says van Werch. According to him, this happened because the general public was less interested in crypto during the bear market. As fewer potential victims enter the space, it naturally becomes less interesting for scammers.  “However, this is short-lived, and I think this will only last as long as we are in the bear market. Once we enter the bull market again, once the market is hot again, and once there are a lot of different projects on the rise, that’s when criminals are gonna take advantage of the naivety that exists in the space,” the expert added. Due Diligence to Mitigate RisksAccording to the Chainalysis executive, any token that holds value may become a target of fraudsters. As long as the criminals feel they can convert DeFi tokens to some other tokens to fund illicit activities, they will try to do so. “There’s always gonna be that risk,” says van Werch. “So if you’re gonna invest in DeFi protocol, do your due diligence behind it. Make sure you are using platforms that are not only clean from an AML perspective but also look clean in the sense that they have been certified, and the code is structurally sound.”  See original on DailyCoin  ",2022-12-13

According to the proposal, Binance’s notoriety of “supporting and promoting high-quality projects” was cited as a reason for the proposed deployment of Uniswap V3 to BNB Chain.  However, Binance’s global presence and strong brand could be under threat by the possibility of criminal action by the U.S. Department of Justice. Furthermore, with concerns surrounding its finances, one might wonder if leveraging Binance’s position in the current market would backfire.  Reuters reported on 12 December that the prosecutors at the U.S. Department of Justice disagreed over whether to file criminal actions against Binance and its executives. This included CEO Changpeng Zhao. The regulatory body further considered delaying the same to gather more evidence. Further, despite the exchange’s effort to be transparent with its proof of reserves to boost investors’ confidence following the unexpected fallout of FTX, investors remain largely unsatisfied.  The possibility of criminal action against the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume would have a crippling effect across the board. Projects tied to its brand could also be gravely affected. State of UNI At $5.90, Uniswap’s native token UNI declined by 66% on a year-to-date basis, data from CoinMarketCap revealed.  With FTX’s collapse as a contributory factor, UNI holders have continuously sold off their holdings at losses. Per data from Santiment, UNI’s Network Profit/Loss ratio returned a negative value since FTX collapsed.

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo/File Photo/File Photo   By Jared Higgs, Luc Cohen and Chris Prentice NASSAU, Bahamas/NEW YORK (Reuters) -A Bahamian judge denied FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried bail on Tuesday, hours after U.S. prosecutors accused the 30-year-old of misappropriating billions of dollars and violating campaign laws in what has been described as one of America's biggest financial frauds. The former CEO of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange, dressed in a blue suit without a tie, lowered his head and hugged his parents after the judge said his risk of flight was too ""great"" and ordered that he be sent to a Bahamas correctional facility until Feb. 8.  The day's events capped a stunning fall from grace in recent weeks for Bankman-Fried, who amassed a fortune valued over $20 billion as he rode a cryptocurrency boom to build FTX into one of the world's largest exchanges before it abruptly collapsed this year. In an indictment unsealed on Tuesday morning, U.S. prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX's customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for expenses and debts and to make investments on behalf of his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC. He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing false and misleading information about the hedge fund's condition, and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said. They accused Bankman-Fried of using the stolen money to make ""tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions."" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in New York said that the investigation was ""ongoing"" and ""moving quickly."" ""While this is our first public announcement, it will not be our last,"" he said. Williams described the collapse as one of the ""biggest financial frauds in American history."" 'SHORTS AND T-SHIRTS' Prior to his arrest, Bankman-Fried, who founded FTX in 2019, was an unconventional figure who sported wild hair, t-shirts and shorts on panel appearances with statesmen like former U.S. President Bill Clinton. He became one of the largest Democratic donors, contributing $5.2 million to President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at $26.5 billion. ""You can commit fraud in shorts and t-shirts in the sun. That's possible,"" attorney Williams told reporters. Bankman-Fried has previously apologized to customers and acknowledged oversight failings at FTX, but said he does not personally think he has any criminal liability. He faces up to 115 years in prison if convicted on all eight counts, prosecutors said, though any sentence would depend on a range of factors. Williams declined to say whether prosecutors would bring charges against other FTX executives and whether any FTX insiders were cooperating with the investigation. Both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed suit on Tuesday. The CFTC sued Bankman-Fried, Alameda and FTX, alleging fraud involving digital commodity assets. Since at least May 2019, FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from equity investors in a years-long ""brazen, multi-year scheme"" in which Bankman-Fried concealed FTX was diverting customer funds to Alameda Research, the SEC alleged. Tuesday's court hearing in The Bahamas, where FTX is based and where Bankman-Fried was arrested at his gated community in the capital, marked his first in-person public appearance since the cryptocurrency exchange's collapse. Bankman-Fried appeared relaxed when he arrived at the heavily guarded Bahamas court. He told the court he could fight extradition to the United States. Bahamian prosecutors had asked that Bankman-Fried be denied bail if he fights extradition. ""Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,"" his lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, said in an earlier statement. Bankman-Fried is expected to appear in court again in the Bahamas on Feb. 8. 'BRAZEN' SCHEME FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, leaving an estimated 1 million customers and other investors facing losses in the billions of dollars. The collapse reverberated across the crypto world and sent bitcoin and other digital assets plummeting. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX's CEO the same day as the bankruptcy filing. FTX's liquidity crunch came after he secretly used $10 billion in customer funds to support his proprietary trading firm Alameda, Reuters has reported. At least $1 billion in customer funds had vanished. The collapse was one of a series of bankruptcies in the crypto industry this year as digital asset markets tumbled from 2021 peaks. A crypto exchange is a platform on which investors can trade digital tokens such as bitcoin. FTX's current CEO, John Ray, told lawmakers that FTX lost $8 billion of client money, saying the company showed ""absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced, nonsophisticated individuals.""  As legal challenges mount, U.S. Congress is looking at crafting legislation to rein in the loosely regulated industry.  FTX has shared findings with the SEC and U.S. prosecutors, and is investigating whether Bankman-Fried's parents were involved in the operation.   ",2022-12-13

A deadline by which PRUs must be received has not yet been announced but will be communicated to platforms “shortly,” a CSA release said.But in light of what the CSA called “recent events in the crypto market,” a PRU will commit platforms to an enlarged set of rules and requirements.The CSA said: “Crypto trading platforms giving these undertakings agree to comply with expanded terms and conditions that will include, among other things, requirements to hold Canadian clients’ assets with an appropriate custodian and segregate these assets from the platform’s proprietary business, as well as a prohibition on offering margin or leverage for any Canadian client.”Canada’s crypto crackdownAs part of Monday’s announcement, the CSA reiterated its stance that crypto assets are highly speculative.“Even with the adoption of these measures, crypto assets or financial products relating to crypto assets are high-risk investments,” the statement said. “These risks could result from, among other things, crypto trading platform non-compliance with registration terms and conditions or undertakings, interconnectedness within the crypto sector, insolvency, hacks, price volatility, and uncertain value propositions for individual assets.”Canadian authorities have taken a largely skeptical view of cryptocurrencies. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has attacked opponents for promoting “questionable, reckless economic ideas” when it comes to crypto, while the country’s central bank warned that Bitcoin and other tokens are no way to “opt out of inflation.”ADADEarly this year, the Government expanded anti-terrorism legislation to block Bitcoin donations to the so-called “Freedom Convoy” protest against Covid restrictions.Meanwhile, securities regulators have been cracking down on unregistered firms, calling out major platforms like KuCoin and Binance by name for failing to get authorization.But none of this has stopped local pension funds from being hit by some of the biggest blow-ups in crypto this year, with the Caisse de Dépôt having invested $150 million into collapsed lender Celsius, while the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan had $95 million in FTX.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.Your EmailGet it!Get it!Copy link",2022-12-13

He diverted their money to cover expenses, debts and risky trades at his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations.Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. government, which charged him with eight criminal violations, ranging from wire fraud to money laundering to conspiracy to commit fraud. Bankman-Fried, one of the largest political donors this year, was also charged with making illegal campaign contributions.The charges laid out in the 13-page indictment could land Bankman-Fried in jail for decades, carrying maximum penalties of 115 years, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for U.S. prosecutors.Hard and fast fallAt a news conference on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called it ""one of the biggest frauds in American history,"" and said the investigation is ongoing and fast-moving. He urged anyone who believes they have been victims of the scheme to contact his office.Bankman-Fried has fallen hard and fast from the top of the cryptocurrency industry he helped to evangelize. FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.Before the bankruptcy, he was considered by many in Washington and on Wall Street as a wunderkind of digital currencies — someone who could help take them mainstream, in part by working with policymakers to bring more oversight and trust to the industry.He was worth tens of billions of dollars — at least on paper — and was able to attract celebrities like Tom Brady and former politicians like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton to his conferences at luxury resorts in the Bahamas.

As a result withdrawals from the exchange have surged in the past 24 hours. Binance had earlier today temporarily halted withdrawals of USDC on ETH and BNB chains.  BNB price has taken a hit amid the ongoing online discussions about a number of issues with the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance. At press time the BNB coin was trading at $268.55, down 5.30% over the past 24 hours. Last week, Binance released a report by an auditing firm called Mazars that showed that its bitcoin (BTC) reserves were overcollateralized. The report received sharp criticism from industry experts who argued that the document lacked clarity. Then on Monday as reported in our earlier news, Reuters reported that the US prosecutors were mulling criminal charges for possible money laundering against Binance and its executives including Changpeng Zhao. Although the events seem to be negatively affecting the crypto exchange and its native token, BNB, the CEO, Changpeng Zhao, in a tweet has urged his followers to “ignore the FUD.” Increased Binance withdrawals Binance saw a wave of withdrawals on Monday and it seems the trend has carried on to today. According to blockchain intelligence platform Nansen, the net worth of the difference between the crypto assets arriving and leaving the exchange has hit $902 million over the past 24 hours. This is far more than the withdrawals of all the other centralized exchanges in the same time span. To put it into context, Binance withdrawals are almost nine times greater than those from the second-largest exchange outflow. According to data from blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence, the current crypto outflow from Binance is the highest that the exchange has seen since November 13, which was days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection. An analyst from Arkham however noted that the outflows from Binance do not seem notably anomalous since Binance supposedly has about $64 billion worth of crypto assets in its reserves. Out of the cryptocurrencies that users seem to be massively withdrawing from Binance is the USDC, which caused Binance to temporarily halt USDC withdrawals earlier today. In a tweet, Binance said that it had paused the withdrawals since it was “conducting a token swap involving $USDC. As a result, $USDC withdrawals are temporarily paused.” The exchange also went ahead to assure its customers: “$USDT & #BUSD withdrawals are available and unaffected. $USDC withdrawals will reopen once the token swap is completed.” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also tweeted saying: “On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals. However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD. The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open.”  Share this article                                Categories  Markets  Tags  Binance   Binance Coin News   BNB    ",2022-12-13

Regulation at a difficult tim… [+2256 chars]",Crypto Daily,"In what it says is an effort to protect investors and maintain market integrity, the SEC of Thailand is preparing to implement stricter regulations for digital assets.  Regulation at a difficult time for crypto The Thai SEC’s new regulations are an effort to counter the various collapses and bankruptcies that have taken place in the crypto sector throughout the course of the last few months.  The agency cites that many investors have suffered heavy losses due to the likes of Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, FTX among others. Advertising is another area that the SEC has highlighted, where cryptocurrency advertising was said to be misleading, further adding to the risks for investors. Regulation in other parts of Asia An article for the Bangkok Post highlights how the Thai SEC is seeking to “mirror” regulation that is being seen in other countries. For example: the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is walking a line between trying to protect investors whilst also attempting to not put damper on the new technology innovations that are springing up out of the cryptocurrency sector. Five risk areas have been identified by the MAS, and these are:  “Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing, technology management services, hedging against retail investors, stabilisation of stablecoins, and mitigating against potential financial stability risks.”  In Japan the regulatory system is focused on financial stability. The Financial Services Agency has promulgated that stablecoin issuers have to be “banks, trusts, or fund transfer service providers, and the FSA issues rules on funding in order to protect against stability risks. Fair regulations can assist investors and traders The regulatory framework for digital asset trading is still in its early stages, but the Thai SEC’s efforts to introduce stricter regulations and protect investors may be a step in the right direction. As more investors and traders become exposed to the digital asset market, it is essential that the authorities ensure that the market is fair, safe and secure. With the right regulatory measures in place, digital asset trading could become more accessible to a wider range of investors and traders, while also protecting them from potential losses.

Although the crypto sector is now in a bear market, which may be affecting investor interest in digital asset trading more generally, Coinbase’s user base seems to be unaffected by prolonged down markets. In particular, data acquired and calculated by Finbold indicates that Coinbase has added 19 million verified users globally between December 31, 2021, and September 30, 2022, representing a growth of about 21.35%. The figure translates to adding at least two million verified users monthly in 2022.  At the end of the first quarter, Coinbase had 98 million users representing an addition of nine million verified users from the 2021 Q4 figure of 89 million. In Q2, the users stood at 103 million, while Q3 registered the exchange’s highest number of verified users at 108 million.  Elsewhere, Coinbase’s global market share hit 3% as of December 6, 2022, among spot trading crypto exchanges, while in November, the share was 2.6%. The share has been rising steadily since September. Coinbase’s lowest yearly global market share was recorded in July at 1.6%. The exchange’s highest market share was witnessed in November 2021 at 4.2% at the height of the crypto bull run.   How Coinbase managed to add more verified users despite market volatility      Although Coinbase is currently operating in an environment of market sell-offs, the exchange’s ability to record a steady growth of verified users can be attributed to several factors like the trading platform’s business model. Indeed, the exchange is touted to have an innovative marketing strategy that entails factors like referral programs and unique features such as enabling users to send crypto as gifts. The user growth also highlights the trading platform’s popularity in the United States, with the exchange boosting of a secure platform with a commitment of adhering to relevant crypto compliance laws translating to trust among investors. Coinbase appeals to beginners and advanced crypto investors exposed to a wide range of digital assets and educational resources enabling users to learn more about crypto while providing incentives. Coinbase’s partnership with leading global brands is also at the center of the growth. In this line, the exchange recently partnered with Google to drive Web3 innovation while enabling the use of the crypto exchange to accept cryptocurrency payments for cloud services. Navigating the bear market  It is worth noting that the bear market has demotivated most cryptocurrency traders who are staying on the sidelines, waiting for market conditions to improve. Indeed the situation has also taken a toll on Coinbase’s business, with the company’s stock plunging to historic lows.  Overall, Coinbase stock has suffered from the general sell-off in equities markets. The market downturn has also forced Coinbase to readjust its business model by opting for layoffs and hiring freezes. At the same time, the exchange has adopted several measures to entice users who are likely demotivated by the prevailing condition. For instance, the exchange allows customers to seamlessly switch from Tether (USDT) to USD Coin (USDC) with zero fees.  With the number of verified users, Coinbase appears to be navigating the tight regulatory space impressively, especially with peers coming under scrutiny for vices such as money laundering and poor management. The growth comes despite Coinbase acknowledging that it honors law enforcement requests to provide user information to aid investigations.  Impact of regulations on Coinbase user growth  At the same, the regulatory rope is likely to tighten on exchanges such as Coinbase following the FTX debacle that saw millions of users lose their funds. Notably, the collapse has resulted in regulators focusing on managing centralized exchanges as users opt to withdraw their assets from exchanges for safety purposes.  Interestingly, there was a dispute between Coinbase and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) after the regulator’s chair Gary Gensler insinuated that the exchange has not registered with the agency despite hosting several securities.  Notably, the SEC Coinbase tussle has been due to the uncertainty regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., especially on whether cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are legally defined as securities. Therefore, the outcome of the tussle will likely have an impact on the exchange user base.  In the future, the number of Coinbase verified users would likely grow, with the exchange setting sights on expanding into the European market. Already the exchange views Europe as an ideal marketplace considering the region has enacted the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA). The laws mean Coinbase will operate in a well-defined regulated environment if it ventures into the European market.  ",2022-12-13

Mr Gensler added that the charges for alleged fraud were a warning for other platforms to comply with US laws.The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against Mr Bankman-Fried in parallel actions. At a news conference on Tuesday, Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that the fraud Mr Bankman-Fried is accused of is among the largest in US history. In addition to accusing Mr Bankman-Fried of defrauding lenders, investors and customers, Mr Williams accused him of using ""tens of millions"" in ill-gotten gains for illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans alike. ""All this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington,"" Mr Williams said. Speaking to BBC News earlier this month, Mr Bankman-Fried sought to distance himself from accusations of illegal activity.""I didn't knowingly commit fraud. I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was,"" he told BBC News cyber reporter Joe Tidy.Mr Bankman-Fried also denied allegations he must have been aware that FTX's affiliated trading company, Alameda Research, was using FTX customer funds.He was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett. As recently as late October, he had a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (Â£12.1bn).A well-known political donor, he was arrested in the Bahamas and is being held there in custody pending extradition to the US. He said on Tuesday he would fight the extradition.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Sam Bankman-Fried denies claims he knew FTX customer money was used for risky financial betsMeanwhile, the firm's new chief executive, John Ray, told a US congressional committee that FTX's collapse appeared to be the result of it being controlled by a small group of ""grossly inexperienced, non-sophisticated individuals"".He said he had seen ""an utter lack of record-keeping - no internal controls whatsoever"".Last month, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US, leaving many users unable to withdraw their funds.According to a court filing last month, FTX owed its 50 largest creditors almost $3.1bn.The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.Cryptocurrencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities - often with a high degree of volatility.Their anonymity means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks, but their supporters say there is huge potential for innovation - and independence from governments.Billions investedSince 2019, Bahamas-based FTX had raised more than $1.8bn from equity investors, the SEC said, including approximately $1.1bn from about 90 US-based investors.It is alleged that while Mr Bankman-Fried promoted FTX as a ""safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform"", in reality he ""orchestrated a years-long fraud"" to conceal from FTX's investors the diversion of FTX customers' funds to Alameda Research LLC, his privately held crypto hedge fund.The SEC also alleges that he concealed FTX's exposure to Alameda's significant holdings of overvalued FTX-affiliated tokens.Mr Bankman-Fried is also accused of ""co-mingling"" FTX customers' funds at Alameda to make ""undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations"".In what has turned out to be one of his last interviews before arrest, Mr Bankman-Fried seemed extremely confident - telling me he would not be arrested and was innocent of any criminal wrongdoing.The 30-year-old turned up in his trademark shorts and scruffy T-shirt, seeming surprisingly calm.But he did admit he was not getting much sleep since his empire collapsed and he became crypto public enemy number one.Mr Bankman-Fried spoke to us not in his home, but in an apartment still owned by FTX, in the luxury Albany complex about 30 minutes from the Bahamian capital, Nassau. Before we started recording, we were told not to take any shots of the multimillion pound yachts or manicured gardens in the marina.We were also warned not to film his apartment building, which he has had to vacate for ""safety reasons"".Once we began the interview, Mr Bankman-Fried spoke for 35 minutes with no topic or question ruled out.As in other recent interviews, he admitted to mismanaging his FTX empire but tried to distance himself from any criminal wrongdoing.He also said he did not think he would be arrested and, off-camera, heavily hinted details would soon emerge to make the public more believing of his version of events.""FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr Bankman-Fried created,"" said Gurbir S Grewal, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.""But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn't just thin, it was fraudulent.""He added that FTX's collapse highlighted the risk unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose to consumers and investors.  The SEC charged Mr Bankman-Fried with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In New York, Mr Williams vowed that authorities ""are not done"" with the investigation and called on ""anyone who participated in wrongdoing"" to come forward. ""Come see us before we come and see you,"" he said.

Heading into 2022, Coinbase debtholders… [+6347 chars]",CNBC,"Coinbase bonds, which have been on a steady decline this year, took a big hit last month after FTX's collapse sent the crypto industry into a panic.Coinbase has $3.4 billion in long-term debt, with bonds that start maturing in 2026. The company's cash position has dwindled from $7.1 billion at the start of the year to around $5 billion at the end of the third quarter.   Heading into 2022, Coinbase debtholders showed little reason for concern. Even though third-quarter earnings missed estimates, revenue at the crypto exchange had more than quadrupled from the prior year and the company was wildly profitable.Coinbase ended last year with $7.1 billion in cash and equivalents as crypto traders swarmed to the app to get in on the boom in prices of bitcoin, ether and other digital currencies. The company was minting so much money that, in April of last year, it went public through a direct listing instead of an IPO, foregoing the opportunity to reel in a bundle of money from new investors.Rather than raising dilutive cash through a stock sale, Coinbase tapped the bond market over the course of the year for $3.4 billion in long-term debt, choosing to pad its balance sheet with what it described as ""low-cost capital.""As 2022 nears its end, Coinbase's debt load is looking more worrisome. Cash and equivalents dropped to $5 billion as of Sept. 30, having fallen for three straight quarters — and that was before the FTX collapse in November caused a panic across the crypto industry.Bond holders have been running for the exits. For over a month, Coinbase notes set to mature in 2031 have been trading around 50 cents on the dollar, down from about 92 cents at the beginning of the year. The company laid off 18% of its staff in July, when CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that he'd hired too quickly and needed to cut costs ""to ensure we can successfully navigate a prolonged downturn."" Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas said in an emailed statement that the company is in a ""strong capital position"" and does ""not have a liquidity problem.""For now, debt investors are in the clear. The first tranche of bonds — $1.4 billion in convertible notes — don't mature until June 2026. But the company is projected by analysts to run up a $2.6 billion loss this year and another deficit of $1.4 billion in 2023, according to Refinitiv estimates. Bankruptcies in the industry have hit with such speed that the future has become increasingly hard to predict.Moody's Investors Service has placed its rating outlook for Coinbase under review for possible downgrade. The firm currently has a Ba3 rating on the corporate family, which is three notches below investment grade. It has a Ba2 rating on the bonds, one notch higher.""They had a very strong 2020 and 2021, but those are in the rearview mirror now,"" said Fadi Abdel Massih, senior analyst at Moody's, in an interview. ""The company is in a strong liquidity position, but at the same time they have to deal with a changing operating environment."" Equity investors started bailing on Coinbase long ago, selling their positions as they saw the price of bitcoin and ether tumble and as other high-multiple tech stocks got whacked. The stock fell by at least 30% a month for three straight months starting in April, and is down 83% this year, pinning the company's market cap under $10 billion.Coinbase's bond prices also dropped significantly over that stretch, reflecting the deteriorating operating environment in crypto and the number of firms being forced to exit the market. But the alarming slide came last month, when the 2031 notes fell below 50 cents on the dollar for the first time. They're now at close to 52 cents. The yield is near 13%, just below its high. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of price. Coinbase's $1 billion worth of notes that mature in October 2028 are trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up just barely from their November low and down from about 94 cents at the start of the year.Analysts at Mizuho Securities raised additional concerns on Friday, in downgrading the firm's rating on Coinbase shares to the equivalent of a sell from a hold. Mizuho's stock price target of $30 is the lowest among analysts tracked by FactSet. The stock closed Monday at $42.60 The Mizuho analysts flagged Coinbase's tight relationship with Circle, the company behind the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), as a potential emerging problem. While transaction revenue has been plummeting at all the major exchanges, Coinbase has been able to soften the blow because of a dramatic increase in revenue from its holdings of USDC.Backed by U.S. dollars, USDC has gained value with the rise in interest rates. In the third quarter, the value of Coinbase's USDC holdings climbed to $368.1 million from $100.1 million at the end of 2021. Net interest income soared to $101.8 million from $8.4 million a year earlier.Mizuho estimates that roughly 80% of interest income was due to Coinbase's relationship with Circle, which was supposed to go public through a special purpose acquisition corporation but canceled that transaction last week.Mizuho speculates that Circle may be looking to ""rethink its business model"" and to eventually take advantage of the leverage it has with respect to its control over USDC.""Any potential change to COIN's USDC income from Circle could have an amplified adverse effect on its profitability,"" the analysts wrote in a report subtitled, ""Is interest income the next shoe to drop?""In the risk factors section of its latest quarterly report, Coinbase pointed to ""ongoing relationships with third parties"" as an area where ""operating results could fluctuate"" should there be changes.Moody's puts Coinbase's USDC holdings in the category of liquid resources, alongside cash and cash equivalents, where the firms says the company has ""financial strength."" Massih, the analyst covering Coinbase, said bond holders aren't in a dire situation because Coinbase has enough cash on hand that it could pay off all its debt now if it so desired.""Why would they do that?"" he said, answering his own question with, ""There's no reason to do that.""For bondholders, today isn't what matters. Rather, they're betting that Coinbase won't keep bleeding cash at the rate it has over the course of the past year.

He illegally diverted their money to cover expenses, debts and risky trades at the crypto hedge fund he started in 2017, Alameda Research, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations, prosecutors said in a 13-page indictment.Bankman-Fried, 30, was arrested Monday in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. government, and remains in custody after being denied bail.   He has been charged with eight criminal violations, ranging from wire fraud to money laundering to conspiracy to commit fraud. If convicted of all the charges, Bankman-Fried — referred to by crypto enthusiasts as “SBF” — could face decades in jail. At a news conference on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in New York called it “one of the biggest frauds in American history,” and said the investigation is ongoing and fast-moving.       Bankman-Fried has fallen hard and fast from the top of the cryptocurrency industry he helped to evangelize. FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.Before the bankruptcy, he was considered by many in Washington and on Wall Street as a wunderkind of digital currencies, someone who could help take them mainstream, in part by working with policymakers to bring more oversight and trust to the industry.Bankman-Fried had been worth tens of billions of dollars — at least on paper — and was able to attract celebrities like Tom Brady or former politicians like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton to his conferences at luxury resorts in the Bahamas. One prominent Silicon Valley firm, Sequoia Capital, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in FTX.  Sporting shorts and t-shirts to contrast himself with the buttoned-down world of Wall Street, he was the subject of fawning media profiles, a vocal advocate for a type of charitable giving known as “effective altruism,” and garnered millions of Twitter followers. But since FTX’s implosion, Bankman-Fried and his company have been likened to other disgraced financiers and companies, such as Bernie Madoff and Enron.The criminal indictment against Bankman-Fried and “others” at FTX is on top of civil charges announced Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC alleges Bankman-Fried defrauded FTX customers by making loans to himself and other FTX executives, and illegally using investors’ money to buy real estate for himself and his family.No other FTX executives were named in the indictment, nor was the CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison. Also not named in the indictment: Bankman-Fried’s father, Joseph Bankman, a Stanford University law professor who was considered an adviser to his son.U.S. authorities said they will try to claw back any of Bankman-Fried’s financial gains from the alleged scheme.   A lawyer for Bankman-Fried, Mark S. Cohen, said Tuesday he is “reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.”At a congressional hearing Tuesday that was scheduled before Bankman-Fried’s arrest, the new CEO brought in to steer FTX through its bankruptcy proceedings leveled harsh criticism. He said there was scant oversight of customers’ money and “very few rules” about how their funds could be used.John Ray III told members of the House Financial Services Committee that the collapse of FTX, resulting in the loss of more than $7 billion, was the culmination of months, or even years, of bad decisions and poor financial controls.“This is not something that happened overnight or in a context of a week,” he said.He added: “This is just plain, old-fashioned embezzlement, taking money from others and using it for your own purposes.”  Before his arrest, Bankman-Fried had been holed up in his luxury compound in the Bahamas. U.S. authorities are expected to request his extradition to the U.S.Bankman-Fried was denied bail at a court hearing in the Bahamas on Tuesday after prosecutors argued he was a flight risk, according to Our News, a broadcast news company based there. He will remain in custody at the Bahamas department of corrections until Feb. 8, Our News reported.Bankman-Fried’s was previously one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper; at one point his net worth reached $26.5 billion, according to Forbes. He was a prominent personality in Washington, donating millions of dollars to Democrats and Republicans. U.S. Attorney Williams said Tuesday that Bankman-Fried made “tens of millions of dollars” in illegal campaign donations.His wealth unraveled quickly last month, when reports called into question the strength of FTX’s balance sheet. As customers sought to withdraw billions of dollars, FTX could not satisfy the requests: their money was gone. “We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.  The SEC complaint alleges that Bankman-Fried had raised more than $1.8 billion from investors since May 2019 by promoting FTX as a safe, responsible platform for trading crypto assets.Instead, the complaint says, Bankman-Fried diverted customers’ funds to Alameda Research without telling them. “He then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses,” the complaint reads. In the weeks after FTX’s collapse, but before his arrest, Bankman-Fried gave interviews to several news organizations in which he grasped for ways to explain what happened.For example, Bankman-Fried said he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and that he believes angry customers will eventually get their money back.At Tuesday’s congressional hearing, the new FTX CEO bluntly disputed those assertions: “We will never get all these assets back,” Ray said.Jack Sharman, an attorney at Lightfoot, Franklin & White, said Bankman-Fried’s recent comments to the media could be damaging, admissible evidence in court. “Those statements in that speaking tour were in no way helpful to his cause,” Sharman said.In its complaint, the SEC challenged Bankman-Fried’s recent statements that FTX and its customers were victims of a sudden market collapse that overwhelmed safeguards that had been in place. “FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s enforcement division. “That veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.”The collapse of FTX — which followed other cryptocurrency debacles earlier this year — is adding urgency to efforts to regulate the industry.Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in financial and securities regulation, said U.S. lawmakers and regulators have been too slow to act, but that is likely to change.“Lawmakers are clearly under pressure to do something, given that so many people have lost their money,” she said. ______Hussein contributed to this report from Washington.

Bankman-Fried is the founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX, which has since gone bankrupt. Specifically, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is demanding a jury trial of Sam Bankman-Fried (a.k.a. SBF), who the regulator is accusing of defrauding FTX investors, according to the indictment filed on December 13. Details of the indictment The indictment alleges that, since May 2019:  “[SBF] engaged in a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX (…), at the same time that he was also defrauding the platform’s customers. [He] raised more than $1.8 billion from investors (…) who bought an equity stake in FTX believing that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures.”             Cryptocurrency    FTX court case update as of October 11, 2023                  Cryptocurrency    Solana price at risk?

Despite the fact that Alameda had, by this point, already taken billions of dollars of FTX customer assets, it was unable to satisfy its loan obligations.”  In response, SBF allegedly instructed FTX to divert billions in investors’ assets to Alameda to sustain its lending relationships and cash flow from lenders and investors. Finally, the SEC claims that, despite becoming clear that the platforms were unable to make customers whole, SBF continued to move millions to Alameda, using the misappropriated assets to finance other investments and ‘loans’ to himself and other FTX executives.” As a reminder, SBF was arrested in the Bahamas on December 12 after the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York shared a sealed indictment against Bankman-Fried with the government of the Bahamas.

How to find out if you are involved in a data breach -- and what to do next         Compromising one system with cryptomining malware is unlikely to generate much profit, but attackers infect a large network of infected systems and servers to generate as much cryptocurrency as possible – with the associated energy bill being unintentionally picked up by the victim.  Also: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNET special report)The attacks often go undetected because, unless the machine is pushed too far, it's unlikely the compromised user will notice the drop in the performance of their system.  Large networks of compromised systems mining for cryptocurrency can, therefore, produce a steady stream of income for cyber criminals – which is why this technique has become such a popular form of malware. What makes this new cryptojacking campaign – which was uncovered in November – stand out from others is that it has incorporated a remote access trojan (RAT) into its attacks. The trojan, called Chaos RAT, is free and open source – and allows attackers to control remote operating systems. The RAT is downloaded alongside the XMRig miner, which is used to mine for cryptocurrency, along with a shell script that is used to remove any other competing miners that might have previously been installed on the system. Chaos RAT has several powerful functions, including the ability to download, upload and delete files, take screenshots, access file explorer and open URLs.Also: Follow this one simple rule for better phone securityThe trojan also appears to be used to connect to a command and control server that could be used for supplying additional malicious payloads. There's the potential that the attackers could use the power of the trojan malware to conduct more damaging cyberattacks – for example, using Chaos to steal usernames and passwords or online bank details. ""On the surface, the incorporation of a RAT into the infection routine of a cryptocurrency mining malware might seem relatively minor,"" Trend Micro researchers David Fiser and Alfredo Oliveira wrote in the blog post. ""However, given the tool's array of functions and the fact that this evolution shows that cloud-based threat actors are still evolving their campaigns, it is important that both organizations and individuals stay extra vigilant when it comes to security,"" they added. To protect networks and cloud services from cryptomining malware and other cyberattacks, it's recommended that organizations implement common best practices in cybersecurity, including timely patching and updating of software and applications, to lessen the chance of vulnerability exploitation in outdated versions. Organizations could also consider deploying tools that can limit and filter network traffic to and from malicious hosts, such as firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems.MORE ON CYBERSECURITYThis Linux botnet has found a novel way of spreading to new devicesCybersecurity: These are the new things to worry about in 2023This cryptocurrency mining malware now disables security software to help remain undetectedWhy cryptojacking malware is a bigger threat to your PC than you realiseThe scary future of the internet: How the tech of tomorrow will pose even bigger cybersecurity threats",2022-12-13

(NASDAQ: RVYL) (""RYVYL” or the ""Company""), a company that leverages the security of the blockchain and USD-pegged stablecoin technology with near-real-time attestation to conduct payment transaction today announced a letter to shareholders regarding recent events in the cryptocurrency market and the implications on RYVYL.Management Commentary by Chairman, Ben Errez:    My fellow shareholders,    It’s been a tumultuous end to 2022 for the cryptocurrency marketplace with the fall of FTX and BlockFi among other firms, along with the sharp decline in the price of cryptocurrencies and related securities. In the wake of this crises, we at RYVYL now more than ever want to clearly communicate the conviction that we have in our differentiated suite of payment technology solutions that arm us to seize on a fantastic opportunity and emerge as a leader in the digital payments space.    RYVYL is not a cryptocurrency firm and has no exposure to crypto firms that have recently filed for bankruptcy protection. The collapse of crypto exchanges only strengthens our position and validates the strategy we have taken. Our smart contract token, known as coyni, has a unique architecture as a USD-pegged stablecoin, backed dollar for dollar in a federally insured custodial account with near real-time attestation, ensuring the continuous health and compliance of the ecosystem. Our technology settles through a proprietary blockchain ledger that we believe is the ideal digital payments product on the market today.    To clarify, each coyni digital token is held in a wallet on the platform and matched with one U.S. dollar held in a custodial account by a federally insured financial institution. The dollars backing coyni are not tied up in investments or US treasury notes and are not converted to cryptocurrencies. All industry failures we have seen recently, in both stablecoin and crypto, occurred with ecosystems that did not utilize these safety measures, leading to severe market disruption. We continue to support regulatory oversight along these principles.    One of the most significant points of distinction for us is that coyni has near real-time custodial account attestation. This was no small feat and accomplished only after a lengthy review of IT, compliance and, specifically, SOC 2 compliance certification from Armanino, a top accounting, consulting and technology firm in the U.S.    The recent crypto market collapse will undoubtedly lead to increased regulatory oversight, something which we welcome and believe will be beneficial to our business and growth trajectory. As oversight increases and stablecoin matures, we believe there will be less need for volatile cryptocurrencies. We believe a stablecoin that is properly pegged to fiat currency, both in coverage and compliance reporting, is equivalent to fiat and is likely to eventually be even better than fiat as it has the potential of being adjusted or hedged by commodity. This is where RYVYL can step in. While some large banks work with the Federal Reserve on a recently announced pilot-program leveraging blockchain backed stablecoin technology, we are already in the market as demonstrated by our successful work in American Samoa.    With a closed-loop payment system already in operation, we bring to market our leading-edge digital payment solutions across the banking sector and in multiple countries to quickly achieve scale and market share. While market conditions have made for a challenging year for stocks in our sector and presented obstacles to our acquisition strategy, we believe the latest fallout in the crypto landscape provides all the opportunity we need to become a disruptive force in the digital payments market and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.    We thank you for your long-standing support.    Sincerely,    Ben ErrezRYVYL Co-founder and ChairmanAbout RYVYLRYVYL Inc.

The founder of the collapsed crypto exchange will appear in court on Tuesday in the Bahamas. ""He was arrested in reference to various financial offenses against laws of the United States, which are also offenses against laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas,"" a document said. This comes after the collapsed crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. last month, owing its 50 largest creditors almost $3.1 billion.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Bankman-Fried for defrauding investors, according to a release on Tuesday. Legal filings claim that he inappropriately used customer funds to bail out the supposedly separate trading arm Alameda Research and fund both Bankman-Fried's personal lifestyle and political donations. “We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,"" SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement.SEC sticks to its guns on denying Grayscale’s bitcoin trust (GBTC) conversion. In the regulator’s first response brief since Grayscale sued the SEC over its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund application rejection on June 29, the SEC reiterated that its reasons for denying Grayscale’s applications were consistent with its earlier decisions to deny every other spot bitcoin ETF application it had received. GBTC was trading at a record discount of 49.12% relative to the price of bitcoin on Tuesday. (Grayscale is a sister company of CoinDesk.)Chainlink’s new “staking” program – where participants can earn crypto rewards for helping to secure the network – was intended to be broad-based: The price-feed provider imposed a limit of 7,000 LINK tokens per wallet to “promote greater inclusion and reduce the risk of a few participants dominating the pool in the early stages,” according to the project team. But blockchain data reveals how one large holder – a “whale” in crypto parlance – was able to get around the limits by creating more than 150 addresses – and then staking the full 7,000 LINK allotment from each of them. The elaborate effort allowed the whale, nicknamed “Oldwhite” by the OpenSea platform, to stake some 1.06 million LINK ($7 million worth).Chart of the DayThe chart shows the number of bitcoin held in miner wallets going back to January 2021.The balance held by miners or those responsible for making coins has now dropped to 1.818 million BTC, the lowest since October 2021, extending the slide from the July high of 1.84 million.Miners' balance sheets have deteriorated this year as bitcoin prices have slumped, denting revenues.– Omkar GodboleTrending PostsGoldman Sachs Sees Gold Outperforming Bitcoin in the Longer TermBinance Withdrawals Surge as Concerns About Its Reserve Report Spook TradersCiti Downgrades Robinhood, Says FTX Fallout Will Weigh on Crypto Trading Revenue",2022-12-13

An additional short-term assessment of more than 1,000 consumers after the collapse of FTX who own or are interested in crypto was also fielded to understand the impact of the FTX collapse on initial findings. Despite the recent FTX collapse, future purchase consideration of crypto holds steady for both crypto owners and crypto curious, with only a 7% decline in future consideration for crypto owners and a surprising 2% increase for crypto curious. Overall, almost half say their interest in purchasing crypto hasn’t changed.  In the findings prior to the FTX collapse, the topic of regulation was already a top concern following the volatility of the market this past summer. 71% of crypto owners and 70% of crypto curious said they are extremely or somewhat concerned with the safety and regulation around purchasing crypto. Both crypto owners and crypto curious selected “it’s your crypto, not the crypto company’s” as the #1 most important safety and regulation measure. Overall, most respondents, 92% of crypto owners and 78% of crypto curious, predict that crypto will be more regulated in the future. The data also finds that concerns around safety and regulation grow as investment level increases.  “The results of the study confirm that cryptocurrency is increasingly appealing and not significantly impacted by the recent failure of FTX. We do not see signals of a market exit.” said Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael. “Regulation and security come through as top concerns and illustrate why Bakkt’s thoughtful approach to risk aligns with crypto owners’ values and concerns.”  Awareness of the crypto news cycle is found to impact shifts in sentiment. Following the FTX collapse, only 33% of crypto curious stated they recalled reading or hearing about any recent crypto events. With no crypto investments and low recall of recent events, crypto curious purchase sentiment holds steady across testing waves. Crypto owners naturally have higher recall of recent events, at 52%, contributing to their dip in outlook sentiment. The data also shows that those who recalled recent crypto events have stronger concerns around crypto safety and regulation. At the same time, the study revealed that 84% of respondents agree that crypto is gaining popularity. Additionally, 68% also say that crypto is the next advancement in modern finance. When tested post-FTX collapse, agreeability with these sentiments all dipped by a mere single digit percentage overall.  Key Additional Findings: Education Remains the Biggest Barrier: Education continues to remain the biggest barrier to entry with 61% of respondents stating they don’t understand it enough, 41% saying they don’t know how to invest in crypto, and 38% saying they don’t know what to do with it. Security and regulation concerns followed, with 21% saying it’s too new and that they want to wait for more adoption. Unfamiliarity with Terminology: Less than 50% of crypto curious can accurately identify the relationship between “crypto” and “bitcoin.” While most participants have heard of bitcoin (#1 coin by market cap), only a small percentage say they have heard of the #2 and #3 largest coins by market cap, Ethereum and Tether respectively. The inability to differentiate between terminology, and lack of awareness of coins besides bitcoin suggest more education needed for adoption. Banks and Crypto – A Trustworthy Partnership: 76% of the crypto curious segment rate their primary bank or credit union as “very trustworthy” or “somewhat trustworthy” for purchasing crypto, compared to 46% that believe the same for crypto platforms. Almost 90% of crypto owners view their primary bank as trustworthy for purchasing crypto, noteworthy because they have already purchased it elsewhere. Almost 90% of crypto owners are open to earning crypto instead of traditional points, and over half of crypto curious are open to earning crypto. While most consumers prefer cashback when earning, crypto owners are equally open to earning crypto in addition to points than cashback. Loyalty as a Pathway for Crypto Payment Adoption: 51% of crypto owners and 48% of crypto curious agree that crypto acquired through redeeming loyalty points would make them more likely to use crypto for payments, even more so than P2P crypto exchange.  Investing for the Long-Term Of the total sample of mid-October crypto owner respondents, over 60% primarily use crypto as a long-term asset, with almost 20% using it as P2P crypto exchange or for payments. The study also finds that the perception of crypto as a long-term investment increases with age.  About the Survey Commissioned by Bakkt and conducted via the insights automation platform quantilope, the Wave 1 survey polled more than 2,000 consumers across the U.S. and was fielded mid-October 2022, providing insight into how many individuals have begun to explore and invest in cryptocurrency in the past six months, as well as those who plan on doing so in the next six months. The Wave 2 survey polled more than 1,000 consumers across the U.S and was fielded from November 21 to November 28, 2022, to add additional context to how sentiments on crypto have changed post-FTX collapse.

How crypto exchanges such as Binance and its now-bankrupt former rival FTX handle customer deposits is under close scrutiny from users and regulators. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with defrauding investors.  Binance, whose dominance of crypto was cemented by the fall of FTX, last week tweeted a so-called proof-of-reserves report by audit firm Mazars. The report showed its holdings of bitcoin exceeded customer deposits on a single day in November.  The $1.9 billion of withdrawals of tokens based on the ethereum blockchain mark the largest daily outflow over a 24-hour period since June 13, the Nansen data showed, and accounted for the majority of the funds being pulled in the last seven days. ""Binance's withdrawals are increasing due to the growing uncertainty about its reserves report,"" a Nansen spokesperson said.  The withdrawals were ""business as usual,"" Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted. ""We saw some withdrawals today (net $1.14b ish). We have seen this before. Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits.""  A Binance spokesperson earlier said it always had ""more than enough funds"" to meet withdrawal requests. ""User assets at Binance are all backed 1:1 and Binance's capital structure is debt free,"" the person said.  Asked whether Binance had enough USDC to meet USDC withdrawal requests, the person added it may need to move funds to online ""hot"" digital wallets from offline wallets, convert stablecoins from one another or carry out network upgrades, sometimes causing delays. Binance said in a tweet around 1654 GMT that USDC withdrawals had resumed. Crypto news outlet CoinDesk reported earlier that Binance saw outflows of $902 million on Monday.  Binance is already under pressure from authorities. Splits between U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a long-running criminal investigation focused on Binance's compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, Reuters reported on Monday. The report sparked a drop of almost 4% in Binance's BNB token, traders told Reuters. 'TOKEN SWAP' Earlier on Tuesday, Binance halted withdrawals of USDC, citing a ""token swap"" - where digital token holders exchange their crypto coins, typically over different blockchains. ""On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals,"" Binance's Zhao tweeted at around 0820 GMT.  Binance said in September it would automatically convert user balances and new deposits of USD Coin and two other stablecoins into its own stablecoin, Binance USD. Zhao said on Tuesday swapping USDC with two other tokens - Paxos Standard and Binance USD - requires using traditional dollars at a bank in New York. ""The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open."" USDC, issued by U.S.-based firm Circle, is the world's second-biggest stablecoin. Dante Disparte, Circle's chief strategy officer and head of global policy, said that there will be ""challenges"" relating to liquidity and redemptions when assets are swapped in the way Binance has done with USDC.  ""The feature of liquid dollar digital currencies should be that they are redeemable on demand, and at par at all times, even during conditions of stress,"" Disparte added.

Incorporation and Launch of Spotlight Media Corporation In February of this year, the Company launched Spotlight Media Corporation (“SMC”), a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of PSYC. The Company contends that it has and plans to continue to strategically utilize SMC to effectively compartmentalize its growing list of performing media assets such as Psychedelic Spotlight, Technical 420, On the Bid, along with its respective ownership stakes in Bonfire and Psychedelic Finder. Additionally, in recognizing the potential that it sees developing through the crossover between the psychedelics and cannabis market sectors, and as further evidenced by the Company while exhibiting at this year’s Marijuana Business Conference (“MJBizCon”) in Las Vegas, the Company will continue to evolve SMC into a multimedia leader positioned to dominate the intersection where each of these value-driven market sectors converge. In doing so, the Company sees a unique opportunity for PSYC to become one of the first publicly traded media-focused companies to be positioned within this intersection of psychedelics and cannabis and is cautiously optimistic as to the long-term value this will present for the Company and its shareholders. PSYC Secures $350K in Private Equity-Based Capital Financing In March of this year, the Company secured a $350K private equity-based capital financing deal with Trent Sullivan of Jackson, Tennessee. According to the Company, the deal, which was organized by former CFO and now Advisor to PSYC, Craig Schlesinger, played a vital role in helping strengthen the Company’s financial position throughout 2022 and directly contributed to fostering the growth of its Psychedelic Spotlight platform, as well as helping facilitate the eventual acquisition of media assets from Technical420, LLC. PSYC’s Psychedelic Spotlight Surpasses 1M Page View Milestone In June of this year, the Company’s Psychedelic Spotlight platform, which launched in the spring of 2020, achieved a long-standing objective when the platform surpassed the 1M page view milestone. The Company believes that the achievement of this milestone in combination with the consistent overall performance of Psychedelic Spotlight throughout 2022, and as observed and substantiated through Google Analytics, demonstrates the successful emergence of the platform as a premier media leader for the emerging sector of psychedelics. As the Company looks ahead to 2023, it expects Psychedelic Spotlight to not only continue to strengthen its reach and presence across the psychedelics sector as a trusted source for news and information, but to also play an integral role in fostering the growth and intended success of the Bonfire and Psychedelic Finder platforms. PSYC Strengthens Balance Sheet by Consolidating Notes with Reduced Interest In July of this year, the Company announced the consolidation of 49 previously issued convertible debentures (“the Debentures”). The Debentures were issued between January 2019 and December 2021 and are all owned by RB Capital Partners Inc. (“RB Capital”), the Company’s largest Debenture holder. Included with the consolidation was an agreement to lower the interest rate from 10% to 7% and thus reduce the total amount of capital owed to RB Capital. The Company continues to maintain the belief that this consolidation remains as part of a larger initiative for PSYC centered around enhancing the Company’s positioning for additional, accretive acquisition targets as well as future equity-based financing opportunities, and its potential to create a more reasonable path toward its intended up listing to the OTCQB. Completion of 2021 Audited Financials In August of this year, the Company published its 2021 audited financials helping to provide PSYC with fully audited financials for each of the two most recent fiscal years (2020 & 2021). Per Management, the Company has made it a priority to maintain current audited financials as it continues to work through a process involved with an eventual up listing to the OTCQB that it intends to follow through within the earliest and most reasonable time frame possible. Although the Company does not offer any guarantee that any such up listing will be completed, Management maintains an optimistic outlook in its ability to execute on this long-standing objective. Diversification Through Strategic Media Asset Acquisitions In September of this year, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SMC, completed the acquisition of media assets from Technical420, LLC as well as certain assets of SB Partners, LLC, that included, but were not limited to, MushroomStocks.com and OnTheBids.com, as well as Technical420.com. Valued at $2.25 million USD, the acquisition was structured to include a mix of cash, preferred stock, and common stock warrants distributed through a series of tranches tied to revenue performance benchmarks. This acquisition has afforded the Company the opportunity to diversify its media asset holdings beyond psychedelics and into the adjacent cannabis market sector through Technical 420, as well as into the mining and precious metals sector through the On the Bids platform. According to Management, this diversification has been critical in allowing the Company, as a growing multimedia organization, to develop a revenue model that is no longer dependent on one market sector. Furthermore, the Company contends that both the Technical 420 and the On the Bids platforms have been key driving forces behind the revenue the Company has generated since each of them were integrated into SMC back in September. Progress Made with Additional Psychedelic-Focused Media Assets Bonfire In the summer of this year, the Company, in partnership with Digital Acorn Ltd, coordinated the successful soft launch of Bonfire (f/k/a “PsycheDev”), an early-stage community-focused platform being developed for a growing community of individuals interested in exploring altered states of consciousness. In the months following the soft launch, Bonfire held a number of virtual community events hosted by Jack Bunce, Lead Facilitator & Community Manager for Bonfire. The Company contends that these virtual community events have helped to refine both the overall objective and mission of Bonfire, along with helping PSYC and Digital Acorn develop an effective revenue model for the platform as it moves closer to an intended official market launch. Though an official market launch time frame has not been established as of the date of this press release, the Company remains cautiously optimistic that Bonfire may evolve into a more integral part of its revenue model within 2023. Psychedelic Finder This past September, the Company joined forces with Nucleus Holding Inc. (“Nucleus”), a venture studio building psychedelic brands, to launch Psychedelic Finder, a full-service, integrated technology platform that will connect the growing community of psychedelics and psychedelic-inspired healing. This partnership is being facilitated through PSYC Tech, LLC of which PSYC owns 60% and will create an opportunity for the Company to expand on the ecosystem it is focused on developing within the psychedelics market sector by way of the various media platforms it is affiliated with. In combining the web development talents and robust psychedelic industry database developed by Nucleus with the PSYC’s content production capabilities and available industry reach and authority that it has established through its Psychedelic Spotlight platform, the companies believe they have a unique opportunity to develop and bring to market an online database and search tool for the psychedelics market sector unlike any other. Since forming their partnership in September, the companies have been dialed-in on developing a viable business model for Psychedelic Finder that not only intends to provide an unmatched end-to-end user experience, but that will also promote safety, responsibility, and reliability in an otherwise unregulated nascent market sector. As with Bonfire, the Company is cautiously optimistic that Psychedelic Finder may become a more substantial part of its revenue model in 2023 and beyond. Management's Perspective In reflecting upon 2022, PSYC CEO, David Flores, said the following, “With all things considered, I think it’s more than reasonable to chalk up 2022 as the most successful year we have had for PSYC since I came on board as CEO in July of 2020. All year we found ourselves up against a fair number of external challenges. The volatility experienced throughout the global markets this year had a particularly negative impact on the psychedelics market sector that presented us with a myriad of obstacles. Nonetheless, the sheer will, and perseverance of our team combined with strategic planning that led to significant moves throughout the year allowed us to not only survive a challenging year but to come out on the other end of it fundamentally stronger, in our opinion. Psychedelic Spotlight experienced record growth over the course of 2022 and is now officially on the map as a media leader for the psychedelics sector. I truly believe this is an incredibly advantageous foothold we have earned within a market sector that still has a ton of potential ahead of it despite the slowdown it experienced this year. And it’s a foothold that we intend to make strategic use of in the months and years ahead as we develop a unique, value-focused ecosystem for this market sector that we believe will be the first of its kind. As optimistic as we remain over the future potential of the psychedelics industry, however, we recognize the necessity of diversification. This is essential to ensuring that the Company has the resources necessary to produce revenue from multiple outlets. The media assets we acquired from Technical420, LLC have delivered a welcome source of steady revenue for the Company that we are focused on expanding upon in the months ahead. Michael Berger and Sacha Hebbert have done a tremendous job respectively with integrating these assets into the Company and with building out a sales pipeline that is demonstrating exciting potential for us as a leading media platform for forward thinking market sectors. In my opinion, the opportunity to tap into market sectors outside of just psychedelics such as cannabis, EV, and mining and precious metals, is a huge advantage for us as a media organization and one that we did not have a year ago. And while we remain a long way away from achieving the revenue milestones we have our sights set on, I can say with full confidence that the financials from 2022 will ultimately reflect our strongest gross revenue earnings since PSYC shifted its primary business model to media in 2020. Minor, yet significant accomplishments were also made throughout the year that I believe will prove to be beneficial in strengthening our ability to begin driving value back to our loyal shareholders. From Debenture consolidation, to raising capital by way of equity, all the way to keeping each of our two most recent fiscal years fully audited, we are continuing to follow the methodical process that we believe is necessary to earn credibility within the public market sector and to effectively demonstrate the value potential in what we are building here. This process now represents 2 ½ years of my own hard work, perseverance, and dedication. Looking back, it is easy for me to see how far we have come in that time and the progress we have made. But, I also see how much more there is left for us to do here until we reach a point where we are able to return the value back to our loyal shareholders that they deserve. With the group of talented and passionate individuals that I am fortunate enough to be working with and the assets we have meticulously assembled within PSYC, I am encouraged in our ability to continue to defy the odds and uncover value and success in less-than-ideal environments.  Here’s to our breakthrough in 2023!” PSYC COO, Michael Berger, added the following, “During the last quarter, we have successfully integrated the businesses and have recorded higher levels of user engagement. The combined company is recording record levels of lead generation for our clients, and we are taking steps to enhance this aspect of the business.  The acquisition has proven to be accretive to PSYC and we are still in the early stages of growth. Over the next quarter, we expect to exceed the growth that was recorded in the last calendar quarter of the year and are excited about our growth prospects as we look ahead into 2023.” PSYC Director and Spotlight Media Corporation, COO, Sacha Hebbert, concluded with the following statement, “SMC is a full-service digital media agency that can build custom ecosystems that promote exciting and undervalued opportunities, amplify brand buy-in, and syndicate broad messaging across a comprehensive matrix of media platforms. Our growing number of assets puts us in a unique position to insert brand positioning smack-dab in the middle of decision-making mechanisms en masse! Unlike any other media-based company within these sectors, we believe that our engagement with end users and communities such as Bonfire and Psychedelic Finder gives us an advantage. We're tapping into the atmosphere, trends and the growing mainstream interest in psychedelics, cannabis, wellness modalities, and even natural resources. We're on the frontlines shaking hands with the bodies affecting the speed at which commercialization will become inevitable and those shaping the distribution of compounds. We're telling the most compelling stories, and as a result, we have a strong hand in influencing outcomes. That's the power of media! Operationally it has been no small feat to integrate and scale the many arms of our transmedia formats, and I am incredibly proud of what we've accomplished so far. In our opinion, we’ve developed the secret sauce. 2022 was fantastic, but 2023 should be a banner year!” About PSYC Corporation (OTC Pink Market: PSYC) At PSYC Corporation we are integrating media, creativity, and technology to develop and deploy thought-provoking ideas and solutions that are fostering and transforming the approach to some of society’s most pressing matters. PSYC has expressed its intent and commitment to positioning itself at the forefront of the psychedelic revolution and as a resource center for discovering and understanding the latest research and business opportunities surrounding psychedelic inspired medicines. In conjunction with the FDA’s more open-minded approach to psychedelic medicines, and as several major U.S. cities continue to approve the decriminalization of psilocybin, we believe investors are speculating that the psychedelic boom could be bigger than that of cannabis. PSYC is your source for current investment related news specific to psychedelic medicines and cutting-edge research improving overall health, moving this sector into the mainstream. We are dedicated to a forward-thinking approach that embraces groundbreaking new technology and innovations and through the vision of business development we intend to continue to evolve into these unchartered territories as the industry leaders of the future. About Spotlight Media Corporation Spotlight Media Corporation (“SMC”) (www.spotlightmediacorp.com) is a Nevada Corporation and is a privately held wholly owned subsidiary of PSYC that was incorporated on February 8, 2022. At present time, SMC operates as a multimedia service company for the medicinal psychedelic industry through Psychedelic Spotlight in addition to the developing community-based platform, Bonfire (f/k/a “PsycheDev”). However, management intends, but cannot guarantee the success or profitability, that the business plan for SMC is to potentially expand beyond the medicinal psychedelic industry by way of other multimedia-related opportunities within other niche-style industries like cannabis, health and wellness, and sports such that SMC can make use of the audience it is establishing, across its platforms for cross-promotional opportunities and with the intent of developing a network of interconnected media-focused platforms.

A bullish order block could see a trend reversal, but bulls will need to wait.  Bitcoin regained the $17k mark over the previous day’s trading, and at press time traded at $17.1k. With the FOMC meeting around the corner, volatility was very likely for the king of crypto and every other altcoin. Therefore risk-averse traders can wait for PancakeSwap to decide the direction of its next move before entering any trades.  Read PancakeSwap’s [CAKE] Price Prediction 2023-24  In a recent article, the importance of the lower timeframe CAKE range was highlighted. The $3.74-$4.12 area was an important resistance zone. In the past couple of days, this region was retested and the price fell by 8% since then.      CAKE reaches a bullish order block, a bounce in prices can occur Source: CAKE/USDT on TradingViewCAKE lost the lows of the range, and at the time of writing traded at $3.72. Highlighted in cyan, a bullish order block was seen on the 4-hour chart. However, the $3.76 horizontal level has already been confirmed as resistance. To the south, $3.7 and $3.61 are levels of significance. Therefore, these are levels where short sellers from the past couple of days can look to take profits. Since the lower-term timeframe market structure was strongly bearish, it was a risky idea to look for buying opportunities at $3.7 and $3.6. The RSI slid swiftly beneath neutral 50 to outline the strength of the sellers recently. Meanwhile, the OBV also noted a move southward. However, it treaded atop a level of support from November. A move beneath this line on the OBV would reinforce the idea that sellers were dominant. The $3.48-$3.6 area, was a pocket of liquidity. In June, July, and August, CAKE bulls wrestled with this area and finally flipped it to support. Its retest in August was followed by a rally to $4.9 by late September. Therefore, another drop into this pocket could see the downtrend reverse. A swing failure pattern near $3.6 could embolden bulls to buy CAKE. MVRV ratio takes a hit in the recent wave of selling, sentiment remains bearish Source: SantimentThe 30-day MVRV managed to get a glimpse o the profitable territory a few days ago but was beaten back down by the sellers. Meanwhile, social dominance has repeatedly risen to the 2.3% mark but not much further, which suggested there wasn’t much excitement behind the token in recent months. The weighted sentiment was also negative, which underlined the idea of a lack of hype and enthusiasm. Given the market conditions, a lack of positive social engagement behind PancakeSwap was understandable. The price charts showed that the downtrend remained strong.

The report provides Hashdex's views on the future of crypto, lessons from 2022 and what investors should be watching for in the coming year.“Despite the dramatic challenges of 2022, we see the past year as anything but negative for crypto,” said Marcelo Sampaio, Co-Founder & CEO of Hashdex. “While we can’t deny that recent events have hurt the industry, we are optimistic about the long-term investment case, maintain that the recent problems are fixable and believe the underlying technology is intact and improving. As crypto continues to evolve and patterns emerge, there are informative trends developing for specific crypto assets as well as for segments like DeFi, Web3, and Digital Culture.”In the report, Hashdex’s experts provide insight into key issues impacting the crypto space and what to keep top of mind next year. The following topics are the seven most important themes Hashdex identified and believes investors should pay attention to in 2023:Bitcoin’s investment case strengthens. Despite its poor price performance, Hashdex believes 2022 was a year of strengthening bitcoin fundamentals and that its long-term investment case remains as strong as ever. For 2023, Hashdex expects Bitcoin to continue evolving across a variety of fronts including progress in environmental discussions, with guidelines emerging that bring together governmental agendas and the mining industry. Particularly in the United States, the firm also remains confident that bitcoin’s regulatory clarity relative to other crypto assets will keep nurturing its adoption by institutional investors.Regulatory clarity will accelerate in the wake of FTX. In 2023, Hashdex believes regulatory strides will be made to reflect the reality that crypto assets are here to stay, and solid public policy is needed to ensure that investors are protected from bad actors. The firm is hopeful that, in the year ahead, focus will be on regulation that requires the segregation of trading and custody service providers, as well as increased market transparency. Many positive regulatory initiatives, from Latin America to Asia, are likely to progress in 2023, which may have a more limited impact on adoption and the demand for crypto assets, but also contribute to positive global regulatory outlook for 2023.Blue chip DeFi fundamentals grow stronger. Hashdex notes the failing actors in 2022 have been CeFi (centralized finance) institutions, whereas blue chip DeFi protocols functioned extremely well, proving that transparent, auditable, and highly predictable smart contracts can be much more efficient during stressful times. The firm believes that blue chip DeFi protocols with strong revenue will get stronger on the back of their well-designed tokenomics, as many of them seek out new business models. Other areas where Hashdex expects growth include the deployment of DeFi services in scaling solutions, greater diversification of liquid staking alternatives, and a growing role for Bitcoin as more DeFi solutions on its blockchain gain traction. The establishment of a framework for regulating stablecoins in the U.S. and EU is expected for 2023 - the importance of which cannot be underscored enough.Ethereum: an emerging crypto-native risk-free rate. Despite ether’s significant price drawdown, 2022 was one of the most important years in Ethereum’s history with the effective transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge). In 2023, Hashdex will be keeping an eye on how the demand for ether will be influenced by new developments in Layer-2 solutions, such as rollups, as well as if Ether gains increased institutional interest as data regarding its energy consumption post-Merge becomes more widely available.Scalability strengthens old guard blockchains. This year’s challenges haven’t slowed developments in the smart contract platform niche. 2023 promises to be the year in which the “old guard” of blockchains - namely Bitcoin and Ethereum - become increasingly modular and scale without compromising security, thanks to rollup-based solutions. Ultimately, although new architectures and governance models for bridges are not beyond consideration, Hashdex believes the tone for 2023 has to revolve around the development and deployment of these scaling solutions, with their incentive models being one of many questions that need to be answered.Strategic partnerships may push NFTs to a broader mainstream audience. The past year in Digital Culture has disrupted expectations as many believed blockchain gaming would be a strong use case to drive mainstream crypto adoption. In 2023, Hashdex believes the main trends to watch with greater attention are (i) traditional gaming companies delivering blockchain-based blockbuster products - a prominent factor for optimism around adoption - and (ii) the birth of social media platforms that can use decentralized infrastructure and NFT technology to challenge the current business models displayed by Meta and other big tech companies.Crypto will benefit from more “ordinary” macro conditions. Crypto is no longer a small, niche investment - it’s an asset class with a significant portion of institutional investors exposed. For better or for worse, crypto will react to the same shocks in risk aversion or preference for liquidity as traditional risk assets as crypto will not decouple from traditional risk assets. Ultimately, Hashdex anticipates that 2023 will be a remarkable year for crypto assets, as long as macro conditions stop weighing down the asset class.Story continuesMr. Sampaio added, “For crypto investment to thrive, our industry must set the highest bar when it comes to standards for trading counterparties, custodians, and other service providers. This is something that Hashdex was founded on and takes incredibly seriously - that is why we have spent the last five years building the necessary infrastructure and processes to protect our investors. Our highest priority remains ensuring that client assets are secure and nothing has changed with our commitment to our values and our mission: giving investors access to crypto through simple, secure, and regulated products.”Hashdex Executed Major Milestones Throughout 2022 and Expects 2023 to Bring More OpportunitiesThe developments seen throughout 2022 are further driving crypto’s long-term investment case. Hashdex has maintained the same core mission as it did in 2018 - giving investors simple and secure access to the crypto ecosystem. Over the course of the past year, Hashdex has continued to deliver on this mission while also expanding its global footprint to Europe with the launch of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe ETP and the Hashdex Crypto Momentum Factor ETP. The firm also launched three thematic ETFs in Brazil, and a first-of-its-kind Bitcoin Futures ETF in the United States.The ultimate goal of crypto is to develop a global, neutral, social and economic infrastructure for the instant transfer of information and value devoid of trusted parties, that can be used by anyone in the world.To read Hashdex’s 2023 Crypto Investment Outlook please visit: https://www.hashdex.com/en-US/research-center/primers/crypto-investment-outlook###About Hashdex Hashdex is a global pioneer in crypto asset management.

In truth, this was all mostly expected by anyone paying attention to the flip-flopping grandstanding that enveloped the six-month period up to the acquisition. But taking a step back from the entropy now enshrined at Twitter Towers, it’s worth looking at a recurring theme that has permeated the saga ever since moneyman Musk entered the picture — one that could play an instrumental part in shaping Twitter’s future. The open source factor Even before procuring a 9.2% stake in Twitter back in April, Musk openly posited that Twitter’s recommendation algorithm should be open source. When Twitter later accepted his offer to buy the company outright, Musk doubled down on that notion, saying in his inaugural statement that he wanted to make Twitter “better than ever,” which included “making the algorithms open source to increase trust.” The principle behind the idea is sound enough. To understand why Twitter is showing people a specific piece of content, and by extension the snowball effect this is having on society, having insights into algorithms could help — and open sourcing these algorithms would play a part. But by most estimations, such a solution is imperfect, because viewing code doesn’t tell you how the algorithm was created and what (if any) human biases were involved in its creation, nor what data it was built on. Little has been said by Musk about open sourcing Twitter’s algorithm since taking over, but he has laid off the entire “ethical AI” team that was working on the very problem that Musk had identified: bringing more algorithmic transparency to the table.  Twitter had in fact previously committed to open sourcing at least one of its algorithms following controversy over racial bias that was seemingly embedded into its image-cropping tech. That never quite materialized, but the fact that its ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team is now pretty much defunct means that it could be awhile before a similar program emerges from Twitter. However, the “open source factor” is still hovering around the world of Twitter in various guises. The “Twitter alternative” Image Credits: TechCrunch Mastodon has emerged as the default life raft for those jumping ship from Twitter, and while it probably isn’t the Twitter 2.0 that much of the world really wants right now, it hints at what a future Twitter could look like. The so-called “open source Twitter alternative” does have Twitter-esque microblogging features, but it’s founded on an entirely different infrastructure centered around the concept of the fediverse: a decentralized network of interconnected servers that allow different platforms to communicate with each other, powered by the open ActivityPub protocol.  Although it springboarded past 1 million and then two million active users last month, Mastodon isn’t the only platform standing to benefit from the Twitter debacle. Tumblr was already positioning itself as a “better Twitter,” and parent company Automattic’s CEO Matt Mullenweg revealed that Tumblr downloads had skyrocketed in the weeks following Musk’s arrival at Twitter. Data from Sensor Tower backs that up, with Tumblr app installs in the U.S. alone rising 96%. Image Credits: Sensor Tower Tumblr isn’t open source or decentralized, but Mullenweg is a fan of the genre. WordPress, which he co-created, is among the top open source projects on the planet, and Automattic recently open sourced its Pocket Casts podcast app. Looking to capitalize on Twitter’s predicament and Mastodon’s modest rise, Mullenweg has been quick to align Tumblr with the open source sphere, confirming previously discussed plans to make Tumblr as “open source as possible.” He also solicited feedback on plans to align Tumblr with the fediverse and support related open source protocols, before revealing that Tumblr intends to support the ActivityPub protocol in the future. This could mean that users of Mastodon and Tumblr would be able to communicate directly with each other. Flickr CEO Don MacAskill later polled his Twitter followers on whether the photo-hosting platform and community should also embrace ActivityPub. Elsewhere, open source enterprise messaging platform Rocket.chat revealed earlier this year that it was transitioning to a similar decentralized communication protocol called Matrix. So it’s clear that there is growing momentum in the social sphere to move away from centralization, toward an interoperable world where people aren’t tied into single-player ecosystems. Bluesky thinking Concept illustration depicting decentralized social network Bluesky. Image Credits: Bluesky This is one direction Twitter could also go down. The company in fact flirted with a similar decentralized approach in its earliest days, according to one person directly involved in the project, while the prospect has reared its head again in recent times too. Blaine Cook, one of Twitter’s founding engineers who joined the company just months after it was created, took to Twitter recently to lament the fact that Twitter could have been a decentralized protocol from the get go. He said that it was something that he had started to develop while he was chief architect at the burgeoning social network, but the project was ultimately canned shortly after he left the company in 2008. “The [decentralized] API was very much like ActivityPub today, and ActivityPub’s lineage can be traced back to those early experiments,” Cook told TechCrunch. According to Cook, those “early experiments” were based on XMPP, the open communication messaging protocol (formerly known as Jabber) developed by Jeremie Miller, who also now sits on Bluesky’s board (more on Bluesky below) alongside Jack Dorsey. But despite the support of some, Cook said the idea just didn’t fly. So, what happened to this fediverse project at Twitter? “I’ve never gotten the full story,” Cook said, noting that he was outvoted on the matter and was later “pushed out of the company” and the API never materialized. Fast-forward to 2022, though, and there remains some prospect that Twitter could still embrace federation and an open source protocol. As the Twitter acquisition crawled closer to its conclusion a few months back, co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey took to Twitter to say that his biggest regret was that Twitter had become a company in the first place (though it is easy to say that once you’ve made your billions). This built on other statements Dorsey had made to that effect, for example in April when he tweeted: I’m [SIC] don’t believe any individual or institutions should own social media, or more generally media companies. It should be an open and verifiable protocol. Everything is a step toward that. Twitter had in fact already birthed a Mastodon-esque decentralized project called Bluesky, which Dorsey introduced to the world back in 2019 while he was Twitter CEO. He said at the time that Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, and the ultimate goal was for Twitter to adopt this standard itself. But it was always going to be a long journey, with Bluesky only recently announcing a beta signup program for Bluesky Social, an app built on the new AT Protocol. If all goes to plan, any company or developer will be able to build an app using the AT Protocol, and communicate with other apps that share that protocol (including Twitter). This means users could elect to use one specific app that presents messages in a completely different format powered by a different algorithm, and then “lift-and-shift” all their data to an alternative down the line if their requirements change. Despite the chaos ensuing at Twitter today, the Bluesky project should remain safe from interference, insofar as it is a Public Benefit LLC that’s operationally independent from Twitter, though it was dependent on $13 million in funding from Twitter through its initial R&D phase. With Musk now at the helm at Twitter, it’s impossible to know where this leaves Bluesky. Sure, Bluesky may be independent, but Twitter was supposed to be its big-name client, and Dorsey is no longer in charge at Twitter. TechCrunch reached out to Bluesky lead Jay Graber, but they were unable to provide a comment at the time of writing. But on the day Musk took over Twitter, Graber did tweet to remind the world that Bluesky was independent and, much like email, decentralized initiatives such as the AT Protocol can’t be bought.   Very curious to see where Elon is going to take Twitter. Very glad we’re independent — will keep working on building protocols that make social more resilient to rapid change. Nobody can buy “email” as a platform, and that’s a good thing. — Jay Graber (@arcalinea) October 28, 2022  Musk has shown on more than a few occasions that he is keen on the concept that underpins Bluesky though. He is known to be a big fan of crypto (some people actually think that Musk is Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto) and decentralization. In a series of messages exchanged between Musk and Dorsey earlier this year, Musk expressed interest in Dorsey’s vision for Twitter as part of an open source protocol. But with Musk currently more concerned with trying to jump-start Twitter and avert bankruptcy, adopting the AT Protocol might not be top of his to-do list in the immediate future. Dorsey, meanwhile, remains on the Bluesky board, and recently said that he’s pushing for Bluesky to be a direct competitor to “any company trying to own the underlying fundamentals for social media or the data of the people using it.” And that, of course, includes Twitter. Challenges Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch One of the biggest arguments against a decentralized social network is likely to come from a business perspective, as federated systems give users more choice and it’s more difficult for companies to lock users in. The so-called “network effect,” where a product’s value increases as the number of people using it increases, isn’t nearly as potent if the user can download an app from one company and chat with their friends who use a different app. “Since the inception of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, network effects have trapped users on those platforms — no one wants to go somewhere their friends aren’t,” Cook said. “The fediverse inverts the control and allows people to choose where to host their online identity. The hope is that ultimately, this will also mean competition between — for example, Mastodon and other social software — and the evolution of features in a way Twitter was never able to support.” Hemant Mohapatra, partner at VC firm Lightspeed India and former investor at Silicon Valley’s Andreessen Horowitz (which backed both Facebook and Twitter), said that while decentralization has its benefits, the existing centralized “Web 2.0” model allows social networks to engineer “serendipity” into their content recommendations using a larger pool of data. In other words, it’s easier for companies to build something where people can find “things” that they like — people or content — and thus entice them back for more. “In centralized systems, the algorithm decides the idea of ‘serendipity,’ based on interests, filters and so on,” Mohapatra told TechCrunch. “TikTok’s entire platform runs purely on this. When you decentralize this, depending on how the back end is built, ‘crawling’ the sharded data is that much harder. Users then have to go to what is a ‘pub/sub’ architecture — users subscribe to publishers instead of getting the platform to recommend and surface things. The surface area of random discovery, or serendipity, goes down.” This helps to highlight that while decentralization might benefit users in terms of giving them flexibility and avoiding lock-in, there are trade-offs. Such trade-offs could also prevent Twitter, or whatever future contender, from being able to monetize as effectively — certainly at the level of the social networks of today. Super-targeted and behavioral advertising might also be off the cards in the fediverse, which would mean money will have to come from elsewhere. That could be old-school contextual advertising tailored to a specific “instance” of a social network, but it could also mean that subscriptions for “power features” become an integral part of social networks — something that Musk is focused on right now at Twitter as the advertising dollars dry up. Ultimately, though, where there are masses of people, the innovators and entrepreneurs always figure out new ways to cash in. “I fully expect for-profit entities to emerge, offering white-label or polished Twitter-like experiences,” Cook added. “A good analogue here would be email: Many people use email daily for important business operations, and many companies are able to provide value-added services on top, despite the underlying protocols and most email software being free.” For now, the network effect is still very much alive in today’s big social networks. But with a growing array of decentralized options, the current crop of social networks could become less sticky over time: If someone can jump ship to Tumblr and still chat with their pals over on Mastodon, there is less impetus for everyone to be in the same social space. Cory Doctorow, author, activist and special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), is a strong proponent of open source and interoperability — making things created by different people or companies work together, whether it’s printers and ink cartridges or, indeed, social networks. So what does the next version of social media look like? “A big, sprawling, pluralistic web of semi-connected systems, some better run, some worse, with both technical and legal protections for freedom of movement to let you change nodes without losing your communities, customers, family and friends,” Doctorow explained to TechCrunch. What we’re likely talking about are lots of separate commercial (or not) apps connected by shared protocols, but none really getting uncomfortably large. If enough social networks do join an open protocol, it won’t matter so much if people leave Twitter and join the same social network, as they will be able to choose from multiple alternatives. This could support a whole new array of smaller social networks — lots of different apps doing their own little thing, built on their own algorithms and moderation policies, with their own business models in place. However, social networks as they stand remain virtual vortexes for the most part, by virtue of the fact that people want to be where all their friends are. True interoperability remains a pipe dream for now, but there are encouraging signs on the horizon. Regulation time Digital Markets Act (DMA). Image Credits: Tanaonte/ Getty There has been an array of anti-trust lawsuits that have already led to some meaningful change, such as Apple being forced to allow dating app developers in the Netherlands to use alternative payment options, while Google has faced similar regulatory pressure to open up. This helps to illustrate how Big Tech is being strong-armed into loosening its stranglehold on their respective platforms. In tandem, these companies have also been trying to appease regulators through more proactive measures. In 2018, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter joined forces for the Data Transfer Project (Apple joined later), an open source initiative to co-develop tools for transferring data between services. Not a huge amount has come from this effort so far, but there have been a few things of note — Facebook has launched a tool that lets users transfer their photos and videos to Google Photos, for example. And earlier this year, Google revealed that it would be investing $3 million in portability programs. But none of this goes nearly far enough in terms of addressing the underlying “stickiness” embedded into these platforms. There is nothing really stopping Facebook and Twitter users being able to message each other today, beyond the technological barriers each company has chosen to implement. This is why regulators are continuing to look closely at these kinds of walled gardens, with Europe pushing ahead with rules to force interoperability between messaging platforms. And in the U.S. there are similar plans for an interoperable future via the ACCESS Act. Elsewhere, Europe’s Digital Services Act, which entered into force last month, has provisions for algorithmic transparency. The European Commission recently launched the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT) to help support its oversight and algorithmic auditing of very large online platforms (VLOP). And earlier this year, U.S. Senators introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act, touted as a “landmark bill” designed to bring transparency and oversight to software and automated systems that are used to “make critical decisions about nearly every aspect of Americans’ lives.” None of this necessarily requires social platforms to open up all their algorithms for the world to see, but in light of his publicized obsession with open sourcing Twitter’s recommendation algorithms, such regulations could spur Musk into releasing the code (for whatever good that would actually do). Throw all of this together into a giant melting pot, and what we have is a fertile landscape for change: a growing array of open source protocols that can bridge myriad social networks, a push toward algorithmic transparency and regulators forcing the long-established incumbents to participate. But whatever promising growth metrics that Mastodon and its ilk have reported over the past month, the fact remains it’s difficult to scale a social network, which keeps Twitter in a relatively strong position for now. “It’s true that the ‘law of small numbers’ is at play here — it’s easy to double a small number and hard to double a large one,” Doctorow said. “And it’s likewise true that when you scale something up quickly, you discover lots of new problems … the hard way. It’s incumbent on decentralization advocates to maintain that momentum and address those problems as they occur.” What’s also apparent here is the emergence of multiple “competing” protocols: ActivityPub, At Protocol (Bluesky) and Matrix to name just a few. Off the bat, these different protocols don’t play ball with each other. But it’s far from an insurmountable hurdle, given that these protocols are not proprietary IP: They’re open and can be made interoperable. “I think diversity of protocol is important, as is diversity of the applications built on top of the protocols,” Cook added. “That said, I strongly believe that interoperability between ActivityPub and Bluesky won’t be difficult. The only thing preventing, for example, interoperability between Twitter and Facebook’s timeline has been protectionist policies by those companies.” There are many different analogies that can help us understand how things might evolve here. In the email realm, there are different protocols for accessing email such as IMAP and POP, while the telecommunications sector has also thrived on interoperable protocols for routing and carrying phone calls and text messages. Once upon a time it wasn’t possible to send a text message between different carriers, but today it’s something most people take for granted. There’s no real reason why social networks developed on different protocols should be any different. Open sesame Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch All this leads us to one interesting pontification: What if Twitter decided to go all-in on open source? Not just a recommendation algorithm or a protocol, but the whole shooting match — codebase, clients ‘n all? It would certainly be a Herculean undertaking, particularly with everything else going on at Twitter right now. It would also be an almost unprecedented move to see a $44 billion private company open its entire codebase to the world’s masses. That’s not to say that it couldn’t ever happen though, as Musk has form in making radical moves. Eight years ago Musk ripped up the patent playbook when he pledged that Tesla wouldn’t sue any company that infringed any of its patents “in good faith.” At the time, Musk said it was all about expediting electric car adoption and the infrastructure required (e.g., charging stations), an ethos that is broadly aligned with that of open source. “Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers,” Musk wrote at the time. “We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.” While the “attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers” facet stands out like a sore thumb when juxtaposed against the turmoil at Twitter today, the fact that Musk was willing to make such a left-field move with the company’s patents is notable when you consider where he finds himself today at Twitter. He clearly needs to galvanize a depleted workforce and prevent Twitter from falling apart. But would going the whole nine yards on open source fix things at Twitter? “What Musk did at Tesla with the patents was unprecedented,” Heather Meeker, an open source licensing specialist and partner at seed-stage VC firm OSS Capital, told TechCrunch. “But I’m not sure laying the code open would solve their maintenance problem — it might generate a lot of good will though. A lot of the maintenance effort for a company — like Twitter, or any other — is in putting together and managing the platform, not writing or maintaining code.” Cook agreed that it would make little sense for Twitter to go fully open source due to the fact that its problems are less about the number of eyeballs on code than it is about infrastructure, as well as the strategic decisions it makes at a business level. “Nowadays, Twitter isn’t so much a one-source repository, but an immense deployed infrastructure that would likely take weeks to set up from scratch,” Cook said. “I’m not sure outside engineers could contribute in any meaningful way. And most of Twitter’s problems these days are policy, not code per se, as much as Musk is fixated on that aspect.” In the more immediate term, however, there are major safety and security implications at play, with chief information security officer Lea Kissner recently departing and content moderation seemingly going out of the window. Open source could have a part to play here, perhaps best evidenced through Community Notes, formerly known as Birdwatch until Musk decided it was time for a name-change last month. According to Musk, Twitter “needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world,” and Community Notes is apparently what will power that mission. Community Notes is essentially Twitter crowdsourcing information accuracy from its millions of users, with approved contributors able to rate and add “helpful context” to tweets. This was opened to everyone in the U.S. in October and started rolling out to everyone globally over the weekend. Community Notes in action. Image Credits: Twitter The Community Notes ranking algorithm source code is available on GitHub for anyone to peruse and already there are third-party developers building products on top of it, such as the open source Community Notes Dashboard, which serves as a leaderboard for contributors to the Community Notes program. The ethos behind Community Notes is sound in principle, insofar as one of Twitter’s biggest problems from a content moderation perspective has been scalability: Algorithms have limited accuracy and struggle with nuance, while there can only be so many humans on hand to help internally. If Twitter was to travel farther down the path of open source, it could help bring a little more trust back to the platform; something that has been eroded of late — just today, news emerged that Twitter had disbanded its Trust & Safety Council advisory group. “There are many benefits of open source, external contribution to the code is just one of many,” Joseph Jacks, founder and seed-stage investor at OSS Capital, told TechCrunch. “Other benefits that would be immediately impactful — at the level of why Signal is more trusted than WhatsApp — include code transparency, and trust and privacy assurance, because the world would know how everything fundamental to the platform is implemented. Open source enables a high degree of provable trust in technology that otherwise is simply not possible.” There is one particularly alluring aspect of federation that could also appeal to Twitter’s new owner in the near term. A decentralized infrastructure could potentially help combat spam, bots and other bad actors — something that Musk has persistently complained about before, during and after the acquisition closed. Different apps on a shared protocol could collaborate and share data. “[With decentralization] I think we’ll see a whole bunch of shared code, design patterns, and eventually, shared infrastructure to help replicate and improve upon the sort of trust and safety policies that Twitter implemented,” Cook said. So rather than relying on a single entity to manage bots or abuse, all the companies on a shared protocol could share blocklists and detection models, bypassing the inherent constraints of a single product team at Twitter or Facebook. With his visions for Twitter 2.0, there are signs that Musk is looking to lean on other facets of the open source sphere, too, including a protocol that’s used by billions of people globally. Signal of intent A Signal logo is seen on a smartphone screen. Image Credits: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty In response to a planned privacy policy change at Facebook last year that would share some WhatsApp data with Facebook, Elon Musk publicly recommended that people ditch WhatsApp for Signal, an open source messaging alternative backed by WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. And it’s clear that Signal remains on Musk’s radar today. In a response to a question posted on Twitter last month, Musk said that the goal of direct messages (DMs) is to “superset Signal,” a lofty ambition that presumably means he wants to make direct messaging on Twitter more secure than Signal.   The goal of Twitter DMs is to superset Signal — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 9, 2022  But it’s easy to say things on Twitter — it’s a completely different thing executing on such ambitious (and vague) plans. However, new evidence recently emerged that Twitter is actively working to revive a previously shelved project to introduce encryption to DMs, while a report on The Verge also detailed some of Musk’s apparent plans for encrypted DMs as part of Twitter 2.0. The report, citing comments reportedly made at an all-hands meeting, indicates that Musk had spoken directly with Moxie Marlinspike, the cryptographer, security researcher and creator of Signal, about helping out with Twitter’s DM encryption roadmap. For context, Marlinspike, who left Signal back in January, co-authored the open source Signal Protocol that powers encryption in WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype and Signal itself. Marlinspike also had a previous career at Twitter after it acquired his enterprise mobile security company Whisper Systems in 2011, with Marlinspike going on to head up Twitter’s cybersecurity operations for a time. Twitter released some of Whisper Systems’ products under an open source license, with Marlinspike subsequently leaving Twitter in 2013 to work on what would eventually become Signal. All signs so far suggest that Twitter’s encrypted DMs plan will channel the Signal protocol in some form, serving as another nod to how open source is shaping Twitter. Twitter 2.0 Twitter is at a major crossroads, and nobody really knows what direction Twitter will take, perhaps not even Musk himself. In some respects, Twitter could be “too big to fail” from an existential perspective as the de facto “global town square,” but that doesn’t necessarily translate into a thriving business. Advertisers are queasy about aligning themselves with hate speech and other forms of questionable content in a light-touch moderation world, and Twitter would be unlikely to attract enough subscribers to replace its lost advertising revenue. It’s difficult to see a path forward for Twitter as a business in its current form. It will have to evolve in a meaningful way, which may require radical moves beyond trying to grow its subscription base. With growing awareness of — and movements toward — the fediverse, alongside mounting regulatory pressure around interoperability and algorithmic transparency, it feels like significant change is coming to the world of social networking. “The reality is that federated services are experiencing explosive growth, more growth in the past couple of weeks than in the past several years,” Doctorow said. “That is an opportunity that is ours to seize — or lose.” But what all this means for Twitter is still anyone’s guess.

In 2022, Van Metre delivered approximately 469 closings and roughly $417 million in sales this year, making it a Top 75 home builder by revenue in Pro Builder's Housing Giants rankings. According to the Magazine, though, it's not just the numbers that helped the 67-year-old company earn the title of ""2022 Builder of the Year."" Rather, ""It was the builder's long-standing reputation for market-leading product design and quality construction, a truly innovative online and in-person customer experience, a commitment to nurturing and empowering young, diverse talent, a legacy of philanthropy, and an impressive and thoughtful investment in off-site production solutions that elevated them to the top of our list.""

""It helps alleviate so many of the issues that the industry faces today. We are excited to be considered trailblazers in this space."" Whereas one could be remiss not to acknowledge Van Metre for their innovations in the construction and home building fields, what makes Van Metre such a special company lies within the way employees are valued. In fact, the newly established Diversity and Inclusion Council is a prime example of employees joining forces to promote positive change and employee well-being.""Van Metre employs amazing people.

Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second overall, is up 6.9% over 24 hours to $1,335. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose 3.8%.Traders have been monitoring the data for signs of whether the Fed’s rate hikes this year are helping to bring down the pace of consumer-price increases, which earlier this year hit a four-decade high. In general, tighter monetary policy puts downward pressure on prices of risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.The U.S. central bank's monetary-policy setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is meeting this week behind closed doors, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday along with fresh projections by officials on the future path of economic indicators.Core CPI – which excludes food and energy because they tend to be more volatile – rose 0.2% in November, also a slowdown from October, the Labor Department reported.The weaker-than-expected inflation figure comes a day after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents see one-year inflation running at a 5.2% pace.The November CPI release is the final major economic report of 2022 and the last key input the FOMC will see before as this week's meeting kicks off Tuesday. The two-day session is set to conclude on Wednesday with a statement due out at 2 p.m. ET and a fresh ""Summary of Economic Projections"" from top Fed officials, known colloquially as the ""dot plot.""“Tuesday's CPI release along with Wednesday's FOMC meeting will undoubtedly set the tone for financial markets as we head into next year,” analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note, expecting another 50 basis point (0.5 percentage point) rate hike by the Fed on Wednesday.Terminal rate will likely be higher in new projectionsFed Chair Jerome Powell has previously said that he and his colleagues project the interest rate to peak – probably sometime next year – at a level that's higher than officials' previous telegraphed 4.9%. According to Deutsche Bank, the rate could reach 5.1% before the Fed pauses its campaign.“We expect the dot plot to lean hawkish … reinforcing the committee’s view that policy will need to remain restrictive for longer to guide inflation back to target,” the note said.Analysts at the French bank BNP Paribas see the terminal rate reaching 5.25% by March and holding that level until the end of the year.“Communications will emphasize the likelihood of holding rates at restrictive levels over a longer time horizon – possibly even challenging current market pricing,” they wrote in a note.Powell will speak following the FOMC’s rate hike decision, at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.UPDATE (Dec. 13, 13:43): Added information about the FOMC meeting Dec. 13-14 and comments from Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas analysts.",2022-12-13

                })();                  Related Reading: End Of The Road: FTX Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Collared In The Bahamas Apparently, his plan was to blame others. His first victim was to be John Ray, whom Bankman-Fried claims to have contacted several times to provide important information. Ray allegedly never responded and was ultimately responsible for the fate of U.S. customers. “American customers were protected, at least until Mr. Ray’s team took over,” SBF planned to testify. The Binance Feud Continues Not surprisingly, Bankman-Fried also wanted to pillory Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Referring to CZ’s infamous tweets that supposedly triggered the bank run on FTX, SBF wrote that Binance had engaged in “a month of sustained negative PR on FTX.” Moreover, Binance’s alleged takeover bid was purely a tactic to push FTX off the cliff, he says. While FTX was looking for options, Bankman-Fried signed a letter of intent for the acquisition, which prevented him from pitching other potential investors. “During that time, I received serious expressions of interest from multiple potential investors who represented billions in capital that could have gone to customers. I was inhibited in responding by the LOI,” Bankman-Fried wrote. Others Are To Blame But Bankman-Fried also planned to place heavy blame on Sullivan Cromwell, an American multinational law firm headquartered in New York City, for the events that followed FTX’s collapse. They allegedly “pressured” him to quickly file for Chapter 11. In his testimony, Bankman-Fried blames the law firm and Ray for a self-serving financial motive. Related Reading: Binance Rumors And FUD Ramp Up – Here Are The Facts The law firms, which also represented Enron, “were paid roughly $700m (!!!) in fees from funds that would otherwise have gone to creditors,” SBF wanted to testify. In addition, FTX US’s general counsel, Ryne Miller, allegedly conspired with Sullivan Cromwell to file for Chapter 11 and benefit financially. In response to Bankman-Fried’s request to keep FTX active, Miller reportedly said, “There’s nothing that can save Sam.” John Ray’s Prepared Statement Meanwhile, the prepared testimony from new FTX CEO John Ray for today’s hearing paints a different picture. Ray will testify that customer funds from FTX were commingled with funds from the Alameda trading platform. In addition, Alameda used customer funds for margin trading, exposing customer funds to massive losses. The new FTX CEO will also outline that FTX Group went on a buying spree between late 2021 and 2022. As part of that, about $5 billion was spent on a variety of businesses and investments, many of which are now worth only a fraction of what was paid for them. Other explosive statements will include loans and other payments to insiders totaling more than $1 billion, custody of private keys without effective security controls, and a computer infrastructure that gave management access to systems where customer funds were stored.

Ethereum rose even higher, jumping almost 6% over the past 24 hours to trade at around $1,320. Other key gainers within the top ten cryptocurrencies included XRP (4%), Dogecoin (5%), and Polygon (4%)Insofar as these figures report on the extent of inflation in the American economy, the Federal Reserve usually reacts by raising or lowering interest rates. Of late, the Fed has raised rates at an unprecedented pace to reel in inflation. Given the evidence that inflation is slowing as well as recent statements from the Fed last month, it is likely it will continue to raise rates but perhaps not as firmly.Previous rate hikes have been closer to 0.75%, whereas the next raise is expected to be closer to 0.5%.Higher interest rates have a ripple effect on small businesses, individuals, stocks, and even cryptocurrencies. As interest rates are raised, it increases the cost of borrowing from banks as debt becomes much more expensive. Simultaneously, cash in savings accounts can begin earning an attractive yield with far less risk than in the stock market.Thus, as rates rise, money slows within the economy as cash doesn't move as freely attempting to chase higher returns.ADADDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.Your EmailGet it!Get it!Copy link",2022-12-13

Bitcoin price, 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView What Will The Federal Reserve Do With The Data? Prior to the CPI data release, the market was forecasting a rate hike of 50 bps with a 72% probability, according to the CME FedWatch tool. This is compared to a 28% probability of a 75 bps hike. Within the next few hours, it remains to be seen how this rate will shift due to the CPI print. At press time, however, the probability of a 50 basis point jumped significantly to 79.4%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Today’s CPI print has thus further increased the probability for 50 bps tomorrow. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Key Indicators Suggest Strengthening Case For Upside Break As NewsBTC reported, JP Morgan published an analysis before releasing the CPI data, according to which it gave the highest probability (50%) of a CPI print of 7.2% to 7.4%. As it turns out, JP Morgan was almost spot on with this assessment. JP Morgan assigned only a 15% chance to the 7.1% outcome and predicted that this could mean increases of 4% to 5% for the S&amp;P 500. Goldman Sachs forecasts that today’s CPI print could mean a 2% to 3% increase for the S&amp;P 500. However, ultimately the FED will decide tomorrow what to do with the CPI data. As NewsBTC reported, it will also publish the dot plot, which reflects the central bank’s long-term expectations and outlook. So whether the rally will find a continuation or abruptly stop will depend on whether the FED plays along. Tags: bitcoinbtcCPIfedFOMCS&amp;P500 ",2022-12-13

The 30-ye… [+4403 chars]",New York Post," Accused crypto crook Sam Bankman-Fried has been busted in the Bahamas — accused of “massive, years-long fraud” that defrauded investors out of $1.8 billion through “a house of cards” built “on a foundation of deception.” The fallen 30-year-old FTX mogul was arrested Monday night after the Bahamian government received formal notification from the US of charges against him. The US attorney for the Southern District of New York is expected to charge him Tuesday with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering. As he awaited his first appearance before a magistrate in the Bahamas on Tuesday, he was separately charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said while revealing the civil complaint. “The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.”    Disgraced former FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday.Getty Images The SEC complaint says that “Bankman-Fried raised more than $1.8 billion from investors” who believed “that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures.” “Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.” Bankman-Fried “portrayed himself as a responsible leader of the crypto community” and “touted the importance of regulation and accountability,” the complaint says.        see also             Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried busted in Bahamas, charged with defrauding investors out of $1.8B       “Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure.” Bankman-Fried also “placed billions of dollars of FTX customer funds into Alameda,” his privately held crypto fund, without telling them, the complaint alleges. “He then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses,” the complaint reads.  “None of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers.”      Previous   1 of 6     Next        Advertisement                    A house in the Bahamas linked to disgraced FTX co-founder Bankman-Fried.

Albany Bahamas             Advertisement           Alameda did not segregate FTX investor funds and Alameda investments, the SEC said, using that money to “indiscriminately fund its trading operations,” as well as other ventures of Bankman-Fried. “While he spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments, Bankman-Fried’s house of cards began to crumble,” the suit noted.        see also             FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried just hired Ghislaine Maxwell’s defense attorney       But “even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds,” it reads. FTX “operated behind a veneer of legitimacy” that “wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “FTX’s collapse highlights the very real risks that unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose for investors and customers alike.” The SEC charges are separate from the criminal charges, which are expected to be unsealed later Tuesday. The shaggy-haired former billionaire has been under investigation by the Justice Department ever since FTX — which had been among the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges — imploded and filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Federal prosecutors have reportedly been scrutinizing how FTX handled customer funds and the alleged transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars from the US to the Bahamas around the time of the bankruptcy filing. They were also said to be probing whether Bankman-Fried manipulated crypto markets by orchestrating trades that led to the collapse of the TerraUSD cryptocurrency earlier this year. Bankman-Fried, who resigned as FTX’s CEO on the day of the bankruptcy filing, has repeatedly denied personal responsibility for the platform’s collapse and distanced himself from fraud accusations, insisting he “didn’t ever try to commit fraud.” He was arrested just after 6 p.m. Monday at his luxury gated community called the Albany in the capital, Nassau. Bahamian police said he was arrested due to “various Financial Offences against laws of the United States, which are also offences” on the island. He is expected to appear before a magistrate Tuesday, marking the first in-person public appearance by the fallen crypto king once estimated to be worth $32 billion. Bankman-Fried had been scheduled to be grilled Tuesday by US lawmakers on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Hours before he was nabbed, he said he would be testifying remotely before the House Financial Services Committee because he was “quite overbooked” and had security concerns about traveling to DC.  That congressional hearing will still be held Tuesday despite Bankman-Fried’s arrest. The Bahamian government attorney general’s office said Monday it expected to aid in Bankman-Fried’s extradition to the US. It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly that would occur. “The Bahamas and the United States have a shared interest in holding accountable all individuals associated with FTX who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law,” Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis said in the wake of Bankman-Fried’s arrest. “While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, The Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX, with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere.”  A spokesman for Bankman-Fried had no comment Monday evening. Bankman-Fried has a right to contest his extradition, which could delay but not likely stop his transfer to the US. With Post wires  ",2022-12-13

The authority stated that it expected commitments from unregistered crypto trading platforms operating in Canada while they pursue registration in the form of pre-registration undertaking.The CSA communication came shortly after FTX entered into an agreement to purchase the Canadian crypto platform Bitvo in June 2022. FTX originally planned to use the acquisition as part of its global expansion plans. However, Bitvo eventually managed to terminate the acquisition by the now-defunct exchange, which allowed the firm to continue operating even after FTX’s collapse.Bitvo CEO Pamela Draper told Cointelegraph in November that the acquisition wasn’t completed because the firms were working to satisfy the closing conditions, the most significant of which was regulatory approval from the Alberta Securities Commission.Related: SEC charges former FTX CEO SBF for defrauding investors a day after his arrestDespite Bitvo managing to avoid the acquisition by FTX, the impact of FTX’s operations in Canada has not been determined yet, CSA communications manager Ilana Kelemen told Cointelegraph. She stated:""The impact in Canada, and in other jurisdictions around the world, will not be fully known for some time, including until the investigation in the U.S. 11 Bankruptcy filing is complete.""Kelemen also noted that none of the currently registered crypto asset trading platforms in Canada are offering margin trading.",2022-12-13

The suit alleges celebrities misled investors into buying BAYC NFTs as well as other unregistered securities issued by Yuga Labs, according to a report in The Hollywood Reporter. Plaintiffs are claiming the celebrity promoters — who also include Kevin Hart, The Weeknd, and Post Malone — were recruited by talent manager Guy Oseary, who allegedly worked with Yuga Labs to pay them for their endorsements through crypto firm Moonpay.   Bored Ape Yacht Club signed with Oseary last year for representation and Oseary’s venture capital firm Sound Ventures was allegedly an early investor in Moonpay. The lawsuit claims celebrities boosted the public profiles of BAYC NFTs “to artificially create demand for the Yuga securities, which in turn would increase use of MoonPay’s crypto payment service to handle this new demand.”  Oseary could also allegedly use MoonPay to obscure how he compensated his stable of celebrity promoters. “In our view, these claims are opportunistic and parasitic. We strongly believe that they are without merit, and look forward to proving as much,” a Yuga Labs spokesman said. Jimmy Fallon used NBC’s Tonight Show to promote BAYC NFTs, with guest Paris Hilton, in a recent episode.    Celebrities have increasingly come under legal scrutiny for their role in promoting cryto products as the once-hot market continues its precipitous plunge. A federal judge recently dismissed a lawsuit against endorsers of  EthereumMax. Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr. were among the stars who promoted the cryptocurrency product.

The researchers found that 67% of the respondents are more likely to play free games if the games offered crypto rewards. Out of the survey participants, 45% believe that there are benefits in being able to trade game characters and items with other gamers, while 23% said that it may have a negative impact. The remaining 32% did not comment. Apart from these, the study also found 27% of respondents are interested in earning Bitcoin (BTC) in games, while only 5% are interested in earning NFTs. This suggests that more gamers are interested in getting BTC in play-to-earn (P2E) games than simply getting NFTs. According to Ben Cousens, the chief strategy officer of Zebedee, one of the highlights of the survey was that most gamers have a positive or neutral opinion on crypto rewards. Apart from this, the executive noted that interest in Bitcoin was also high. Cousens explained that: “Despite the bulk of industry attention being focused on NFTs, we found that Bitcoin stands out as the most popular decentralized asset amongst gamers when compared against other cryptocurrencies, including NFTs.”When examining which cryptocurrencies the respondents own, the researchers found that 55% don’t hold cryptocurrencies. The rest holds either Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) or Dogecoin (DOGE).

The interest has been negligible for some time, however, earning users just 0.1%. ADADDAI is MakerDAO’s decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin. It’s backed by a combination of decentralized assets (i.e., Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, etc.) and centralized ones (i.e., Circle’s USDC). It’s the sector’s fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, per CoinGecko.Now, though, following an executive vote passed on December 11 and executed on-chain today, the protocol's interest rate will rise to 1%. Members of the MakerDAO governance ecosystem were given the option to vote on leaving the rate at 0.1% or raising it anywhere from .25% to 1%. ""The voting options were proposed by the MakerDAO Open Market Committee,"" a MakerGrowth spokesperson told Decrypt. ""This is a special group voted by MKR holders and Delegates through a standard governance cycle to provide guidance on parameter changes of the Maker Protocol, including Maker Vault fees, debt ceilings, and DSR adjustments.""The Committee's initial proposal can be found here.The move to increase the rate by 100 basis points earned a majority vote of 71.25%. A total of 77,599 MKR tokens, MakerDAO's governance token, were used in the vote. Alongside the increase in the protocol's interest rate, the vote also effectuated the launch of a new vault type to mint more DAI tokens using Gnosis (GNO) as collateral, offboarding the RENBTC vault type, and various MakerDAO Open Market Committee parameter changes. The parameter changes revolve primarily around the amount of debt different vaults can safely onboard.ADADTwenty different ""recognized delegates"" within the ecosystem will also earn 103,230 DAI for their governance work.MakerDAO, the 'Endgame', and RWAsThe reason the protocol can afford to raise rates this much is thanks to new revenue generated from so-called real-world assets (RWAs). As part of Rune Christensen’s, Maker’s founder, Endgame Plan, the protocol has made a hard push to create new money streams from some of its idle holdings. One such stream comes from RWAs, which are assets untied to the world of crypto. The Endgame Plan is a three-part proposal to firm up MakerDAO against regulatory capture. First proposed as a response to authorities' blacklisting crypto mixer Tornado Cash, Christensen wants the protocol to generate as much money as possible via all means in order to convert to Ethereum.Ethereum, unlike RWAs or Circle's USDC, is far more difficult to halt should authorities turn their gaze upon the crypto bank.For example, the MakerDAO community voted to deploy 500 million DAI to buy up U.S. short-term Treasuries and bonds from BlackRock.

In September, Bankman-Fried drafted a never-published document saying Alameda should be shut down permanently because it didn’t make enough money from trading, the filing said.The CFTC was not immediately available for comment.Bloomberg initially reported on news of the lawsuit.Read more: US SEC Charges Sam Bankman-Fried for Defrauding FTX InvestorsUPDATE (Dec 13, 15:10 UTC): Adds details from filing.UPDATE (Dec 13, 16:17 UTC): Removes ""report"" from headline and confirms filing.",2022-12-13

Politicians around the globe have also been actively involved, with several nations pledging to go carbon-neutral in the next couple of decades.Amid all the initiatives and conferences led by politicians and billion-dollar companies over the years, the threat of global warming and the carbon emissions spilling into the atmosphere have only risen. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, was the 27th United Nations climate change conference. More commonly referred to as COP, the conference is one of the largest of its kind that sees attendance from top policymakers and tech CEOs. COP27 ultimately resulted in minimal progress on loss and damage, with high-emission countries agreeing to compensate those countries enduring the brunt of the climate mayhem that they played a negligible role in causing. But, once again, no promise was made to stop the emissions fueling this disaster.Politician-led conferences such as COP27 have become a glaring example of everything that is wrong with such initiatives. COP27 was host to more than 600 representatives of fossil fuel companies and many others who were there to prevent rather than support progress and action. Above all, the event was sponsored by the largest polluter of plastic in the world — Coca-Cola.The annual climate carnival concept was probably not the best way to encourage meaningful action on global warming. The presence of the fossil fuel industry and continued failure to fulfill their intended purpose means the problem of climate change needs a modern solution, and for many, decentralized tech is the key that can benefit climate initiatives in the long run.Decentralized solutionsDecentralized tech has proven revolutionary in data management for many industries apart from the financial sector. Climate change initiatives are already integrating blockchain tech to their benefit including an increasing number of projects at COP held yearly conferences. KPMG U.S. climate data and technology principal Arun Ghosh told Cointelegraph:“One of the major outcomes of COP27 was landing on the loss and damage set of agreements enabling wealthier nations to help provision and plan for the recovery of people and livelihoods in under-resourced nations. Blockchain not only provides the trust and transparency set of enablers but with the introduction of CBDC pilots as well as the adoption of BTC as a recognized medium of exchange in countries like El Salvador, there are accelerated investments and plans emerging to integrate and transact between organizations, countries and citizens.”Blockchain tech can be implemented in many ways to make climate change-related initiatives more efficient. Recycling is one sector where blockchain can encourage participation by giving a financial reward for depositing recyclables like plastic containers, cans, or bottles. Similar setups already exist in several places around the world.Recent: Gensler’s approach toward crypto appears skewed as criticisms mountPlastiks is a nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace that sponsors initiatives to cut down on plastic waste. Plastiks partners with recycling firms and certifies their plastic recycling using NFTs that can become an additional source of income for the recycling firms. The project claims that recycling data, once recorded on the blockchain, also becomes a hard receipt of how much plastic has been removed.Due to its ability to transparently track crucial environmental data and demonstrate whether obligations were reached, blockchain technology can also deter businesses and governments from breaking their environmental commitments or falsely claiming progress. For example, Regen Network offers blockchain-based fintech solutions for ecological claims and data. Some of their offerings include a public ecological accounting system and the Regen Registry, which allows land stewards to sell their ecosystem services directly to buyers around the world.EarthFund DAO is another environmental initiative that organizes a decentralized community looking to tackle humanity’s environmental problems. The platform enables tokenholders to vote for and crowdfund “world-changing projects” such as the EarthFund Carbon capture project.Crypto Climate Accord is a private sector-led initiative focused on decarbonizing the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. To date, more than 250 companies and individuals in crypto, finance, NGOs and more have joined the movement.Amid all the major use cases of blockchain tech, its progression in aiding the very complex carbon credit market has been most talked about — for both good and bad reasons.Carbon markets and how they workA carbon credit represents one metric ton of carbon dioxide, which can be bought, sold or retired. If a business is subject to cap-and-trade regulation (such as the California Cap and Trade Program), it probably has a set number of credits that it can apply to its cap. The company may trade, sell or store the extra carbon credits if it emits fewer tons of carbon dioxide than it is allowed.An emission allowance from the seller is bought when a credit is sold. Despite the fact that emissions reduction is the result of an action, a credit becomes tradeable as a result of a genuine reduction in emissions.Carbon markets aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enabling the trading of emission units (carbon credits), which are certificates representing emission reductions. Trading enables entities that can reduce emissions at a lower cost to be paid to do so by higher-cost emitters. By putting a price on carbon emissions, carbon market mechanisms raise awareness of the environmental and social costs of carbon pollution, encouraging investors and consumers to choose lower-carbon paths. There are two main categories of carbon markets: cap-and-trade and voluntary. Cap-and-trade sets a mandatory limit (cap) on greenhouse gas emissions and organizations that exceed these limits can purchase excess allowances to fill the gap or pay a fine. As its name suggests, the mandatory market is used by companies and governments that are legally mandated to offset their emissions. The voluntary carbon market, on the other hand, operates outside the compliance markets but in parallel, allowing private companies and individuals to purchase carbon credits on a voluntary basis.Problems with carbon creditsCarbon credits have been touted as a market-based fix to help curb carbon emissions, but they come with a slew of problems. Carbon credit markets are ridden by poor offset quality, where certain credits might not be of the same quality as marketed and some are outdated and no longer meet the standards of top carbon offset certification organizations.Some organizations offering such carbon offsets don’t do what they say they will. Voluntary carbon markets are largely unregulated and companies often get away with false advertising called greenwashing. These businesses either invest in non-verified credits or double-count the same credit. All of these actions trick buyers into believing they are reducing their emissions when they are actually not.For example, according to Yale Environmental 360, a total of one billion tons of CO2 worth of credits have been made available for purchase so far on the voluntary carbon market. However, there are roughly 600–700 million tons more sellers than purchasers. Consequently, only roughly 300–400 million tons of CO2 offsets are actually achieved. This indicates that somewhere between 600 and 700 million tons of CO2 are produced without being offset.How blockchain can helpThere have been significant advances in computational technology within the blockchain realm that can enhance the efficiency of these carbon markets. Blockchain tech can aid in the process of credit creation and validation. R.A. Wilson, chief technology officer at digital carbon offset trading platform 1GCX, told Cointelegraph:“Blockchain can vastly improve existing bottlenecks within the current carbon credits market, including issues surrounding fraud and misrepresentation and duplication of credits. While these improvements will be key to scaling the carbon credits market and building greater trust within the industry, blockchain is only one part of the solution. To scale the tokenized carbon credits market to its full potential, the industry will also require participation by trusted and established carbon credit providers, as well as collaboration with regulators and government agencies.”KLIMA DAO is driving the development of the voluntary carbon market by building a decentralized infrastructure that makes the market more transparent and accessible. It sells bonds and distributes rewards to KLIMA tokenholders. Every bond sale adds to an ever-growing green treasury or improves liquidity for key environmental assets.Nori is another blockchain-based carbon credit market built with farmers in focus. This project supports farmers adopting regenerative agriculture projects to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.Tegan Keele, KPMG U.S. climate data and technology leader, told Cointelegraph that blockchain, along with other technologies, certainly has the ability to help carbon credit markets in terms of traceability: “A credit can be traceable but not high quality — blockchain won’t inherently solve the quality problem, but it can help validate when a credited producer makes statements regarding origin or quality.”Still, not everyone is convinced. Dan Stein, director of the Giving Green earth climate initiative, believes the problem is much bigger than double counting or traceability.Recent: NFTs could help solve diamond certification fraudStein told Cointelegraph that blockchain-based climate solutions are hot air and that the real problem with carbon credits is offset quality:“If anything, chain-based carbon credits exacerbate this problem by creating a credit as a commodity when it is instead a differentiated product. In fact, I’ve heard stories of companies ‘laundering’ old offsets that they couldn’t sell any other way onto these chain-based solutions.”He added that by making transactions easier, “it turns credits into more of a commodity, and everyone treats them as the same. What has happened in practice is that project developers have taken old low-additionality credits that they can’t sell in a normal market and loaded them ‘on-chain,’ where suddenly they have found new buyers.”The use of blockchain technology in the climate change fight has faced appreciation and criticism alike. On one hand, decentralized tech is being actively integrated for new solutions at a global level to make certain aspects more transparent and streamlined. On the other, climate activists believe that current blockchain solutions aren’t as helpful and only focus on tokenization.Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see which projects catch on and scale to meet the challenges of climate change.

Ray III, but following the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas on Monday and subsequent charge by the SEC, it's unlikely that the co-founder and former CEO will appear remotely like first planned. As of this morning, the committee's witness list only names Ray.Bankman-Fried said he'd participate after a back-and-forth on Twitter with Rep. Maxine Waters, the committee's chair. Previously, Bankman-Fried warned that he doesn't have access to much of his personal or professional data and, as such, expressed doubt over how helpful he'd be to the committee.Last month, Binance agreed to buy FTX, which was facing a liquidity crisis. Binance backed out a day later after taking a look at FTX's books. FTX then filed for bankruptcy protection and Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO.Ray, a corporate restructuring veteran who oversaw Enron's bankruptcy process, said FTX was in an ""unprecedented"" mess and that he'd never ""seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information."" Ray also claimed that Bankman-Fried has been making “erratic and misleading public statements” about FTX. The former CEO has given several interviews since leaving the post.The collapse of FTX, which has dragged down other players in the crypto industry, could impact more than a million creditors. Prosecutors in the US are said to be investigating Bankman-Fried for possible fraud.As of the time of writing, Bankman-Fried is not scheduled for the Senate Banking Committee's hearing on Wednesday. ""Crypto Crash: Why the FTX Bubble Burst and the Harm to Consumers"" will feature testimony from American University Washington College of Law professor Hilary J. Allen and Jennifer J. Schulp, the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives.

It's a lesson I've had to learn the hard way in my career. The Fed is the most powerful financial institution that the world has ever known. Mere commentary from the Fed is enough to move markets; Fed policy moves the economy. Some of the smartest people I have met in my career are avid ""Fed watchers"", and no doubt, I've come to respect why. Most investors are convinced that the major indices (SPX) (SP500) (DIA) (QQQ) (NDX) are now ""in the hands of the Fed"", and will ""bottom out"" once Fed policy pivots to a less aggressive stance. That is to say, once inflation cools down. As most readers here understand, the Fed is increasing (or ""hiking"") interest rates in order to slow down the economy, with the goal of taming inflation. The Fed uses a wide variety of economic data to drive its policies, carefully monitoring the relationship between rates and growth. The Fed is steadily ratcheting up rates to 4%+, where it will likely pause, and wait for inflation to come down to its 2% target rate. Because stocks are intrinsically valued based on the present value of future cash flows, they are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Higher interest rates mean higher discount rates on these future cash flows. The types of companies that I am most interested in - tech companies - are particularly sensitive because so much of their present value depends upon their future cash flows, their growth. There is another, more intuitive way to think about it. If the Fed is hiking rates to slow economic growth, companies that derive significant portions of their value from future growth will be the ones most affected. This is why there has been a ""great rotation"" into lower growth companies, that will be less impacted. Either way, you cannot totally wash out the risks of inflation by moving to a more defensive portfolio. In a market that is driven so heavily by passive investment flows, all stocks will exhibit a significant level of correlation. Therefore, even for the totally passive investor only buying index funds, tracking inflation is important. Problems with Tracking Inflation Institutional investors can get some sense of where inflation is headed by using futures to back into the implied Fed Fund rates. These futures are reflective of market expectations, which are, of course, driven by inflation expectations. This is useful, but the data required is not available to most people. Most of the people have to wait for CPI (Consumer Price Index) reports from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, that detail the official inflation numbers. The latest report will be released today (December 13th). The next report, for December 2022, will come on January 12th. Aside from waiting for an entire month to get a snapshot of the data, there is also the fact that the methodology is often changed. This has come with significant criticism, as it has led to wide distortions over time:    In the conventional economic world, you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in price of a market basket of consumer products, defined by a government agency... ...They Define a synthetic metric, right? I'm going to say you should have a 1,000 sqft apartment, and you should have a used car, and you should eat three hamburgers a week. Now 10 years go by and the apartment costs more; I could adjust the market basket--they call them hedonic adjustments. I could decide that, in 1970, you needed 1,000 sqft. But in the year 2020, you only need 700 sqft because we've miniaturized televisions, and we've got more efficient electric appliances, and because things have collapsed out of the iPhone you just don't need as much space. So now it may be that the apartment costs 50% more, but after the hedonic adjustment, there is no inflation. Because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should have. -Michael Saylor (CEO of MicroStrategy &amp; bitcoin advocate)  What is Chainlink? In response to my articles related to cryptocurrency, the comments I have received are often filled with the same old platitudes about crypto being ""pointless"", ""worthless"", ""a scam"", as so on... So I wanted to write this article as a rebuttal to those sorts of opinions. Not another philosophical piece about monetary theory, but a practical example of a cryptocurrency mechanism people might want to use - One that I use myself. I won't get into all of the complexities here, only a brief summary is necessary: Chainlink is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to validate high-quality data for use in smart contracts (a type of contract that is written in code and stored/executed on the blockchain). The validators of the Chainlink blockchain/network effectively run a highly secure data platform that the broader crypto ecosystem can use to engineer more sophisticated decentralized applications. Chainlink falls into the category of cryptocurrency projects that I follow, but don't hold a position in given that we are going through another ""crypto winter"" and what that means for smaller projects. Truflation Truflation is an application that uses the infrastructure of this decentralized and independent network to calculate inflation in real-time. This can give any investor an up-to-the-minute look at the inflation rate, between the official CPI releases. You can access it straight from a normal web browser at (https://app.truflation.com/). Truflation data for the US (Truflation) From this data, we can see that inflation is at its lowest point for the year. The inflation rate is not only down close to 50% from its high of 12% annually. If you drill down into the different categories, you will see that this has been driven by a dramatic drop in transportation costs. Truflation data for the UK (Truflation) Interestingly, Truflation also offers a look into inflation rates in the UK. Here we see an eye-watering 18.3% annual inflation rate! This has been mostly driven by skyrocketing utility/energy costs, as a result of the war in Eastern Europe. In addition, rising housing costs. Conclusion: Will it match the CPI?  And so, it begs the question: How close will the Truflation data be to the official numbers that will be released this morning? We will find out in a few hours, but I suspect that Truflation will correctly predict the momentum, showing that the rate of inflation has meaningfully declined.",2022-12-13

Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and head of the popular cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been arrested in the Bahamas at the behest of U.S. prosecutors, who have filed charges against him. Bankman-Fried also faces charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bankman-Fried's arrest follows revelations that FTX lent customer assets to Alameda Research, which he also owned, and that FTX had filed for bankruptcy. ""Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the [Southern District of New York],"" said U.S. attorney Damian Williams in a Twitter statement on Monday night. ""We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time."" It's unclear precisely what charges Bankman-Fried faces, but authorities were looking at him for potential fraud charges. ""The SEC has authorized separate charges relating to his violations of securities laws, to be filed publicly tomorrow,"" said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, in a Monday night statement.  This morning, the SEC alleged that Bankman-Fried had been diverting customer funds from FTX to Alameda Research ""from the start,"" and that he had also used customer assets to fund venture investments, real estate purchases, and even political donations. Bankman-Fried was known to be a major donor to Democratic politicians (the second-largest in the 2022 election cycle, according to Forbes). Bankman-Fried has also stated that he secretly gave a lot to Republicans, too, though this hasn't been verified. ""I've been their third-biggest Republican donor this year as well,"" but it's ""not generally known,"" because ""all my Republican donations were dark,"" he said in a recent YouTube interview.

Bankman-Fried has blamed incompetence for any crimes he may have committed. ""I didn't knowingly commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried told the BBC last weekend. ""I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.""

FREE MINDS Virginia Postrel offers a fascinating history of how department stores helped liberate women—and moral panic. From her Wall Street Journal essay: Urban shopping districts were where women claimed the right to dine outside their homes, walk unescorted and take public transportation without loss of reputation. Thousands of female sales clerks flowed out of stores in the evenings, when downtowns had previously been male territory. Department stores provided ladies' rooms that gave women places to use the toilet and refresh their hair and clothing. They offered female-friendly tearooms. Directly and indirectly, modern shopping enlarged women's public role. Of course, this led to new levels of contact between men and women and that freaked a lot of people out: Men known as ""mashers"" gathered in shopping districts to ogle and chat up women. Some were no more than well-dressed flirts, violating Victorian norms in ways that few today would find objectionable. Many contented themselves with what an outraged clubwoman termed ""merciless glances."" Others followed, catcalled and in some cases fondled women as they strolled between stores, paused to look in windows or waited for trams. Postrel offers more details in her newsletter: Newspapers launched anti-masher crusades and prominent women demanded stricter law enforcement and stern punishment.…The crusade against mashers, while based on a real problem, had a strong element of moral panic.  FREE MARKETS The obvious cause of homelessness: not enough housing. Jerusalem Demsas with more in The Atlantic: In their book, Homelessness Is a Housing Problem, the University of Washington professor Gregg Colburn and the data scientist Clayton Page Aldern demonstrate that ""the homelessness crisis in coastal cities cannot be explained by disproportionate levels of drug use, mental illness, or poverty."" Rather, the most relevant factors in the homelessness crisis are rent prices and vacancy rates. Colburn and Aldern note that some urban areas with very high rates of poverty (Detroit, Miami-Dade County, Philadelphia) have among the lowest homelessness rates in the country, and some places with relatively low poverty rates (Santa Clara County, San Francisco, Boston) have relatively high rates of homelessness. The same pattern holds for unemployment rates: ""Homelessness is abundant,"" the authors write, ""only in areas with robust labor markets and low rates of unemployment—booming coastal cities."" […] America has had populations of mentally ill, drug-addicted, poor, and unemployed people for the whole of its history, and Los Angeles has always been warmer than Duluth—and yet the homelessness crisis we see in American cities today dates only to the 1980s. What changed that caused homelessness to explode then? Again, it's simple: lack of housing. The places people needed to move for good jobs stopped building the housing necessary to accommodate economic growth. And why don't many cities have enough housing? In large part because regulations have made it difficult:  Few Republican-dominated states have had to deal with severe homelessness crises, mainly because superstar cities are concentrated in Democratic states. Some blame profligate welfare programs for blue-city homelessness, claiming that people are moving from other states to take advantage of coastal largesse. But the available evidence points in the opposite direction—in 2022, just 17 percent of homeless people reported that they'd lived in San Francisco for less than one year, according to city officials. Gregg Colburn and Clayton Aldern found essentially no relationship between places with more generous welfare programs and rates of homelessness. And abundant other research indicates that social-welfare programs reduce homelessness. Consider, too, that some people move to superstar cities in search of gainful employment and then find themselves unable to keep up with the cost of living—not a phenomenon that can be blamed on welfare policies. But liberalism is largely to blame for the homelessness crisis: A contradiction at the core of liberal ideology has precluded Democratic politicians, who run most of the cities where homelessness is most acute, from addressing the issue. Liberals have stated preferences that housing should be affordable, particularly for marginalized groups that have historically been shunted to the peripheries of the housing market. But local politicians seeking to protect the interests of incumbent homeowners spawned a web of regulations, laws, and norms that has made blocking the development of new housing pitifully simple.  Read the rest here.  FOLLOWUP Bari Weiss has released the latest installment of the Twitter Files, for which Twitter CEO Elon Musk has granted access to internal documents to a small group of friendly reporters. Now on installment five, the ""files"" reveal more about Twitter's internal deliberation processes regarding things like de-amplifying accounts, the Hunter Biden laptop story and Hunter Biden dick pics, misinformation reports from law enforcement, and Donald Trump's account suspension. So far, the dispatches have contained some interesting and notable information, and also a lot of Musk-friendly spin and culture war hyperbole. Some other perspectives… David French's take on the Twitter Files: ""The picture that emerges is of a company that simply could not create and maintain clear, coherent, and consistent standards to restrict or manage allegedly harmful speech on its platform. Moreover, it's plain that Twitter's moderation czars existed within an ideological monoculture that made them far more tolerant toward the excesses of their own allies. In other words, Twitter behaved exactly like public and private universities in the era when speech codes ruled the campus."" Mike Masnick's take on the Twitter Files: ""They are all written by people who appear to have (1) no idea what they're looking at (2) no interest in talking to anyone who does understand it and (3) no concern about presenting them in an extremely misleading light in an effort to push a narrative that is not even remotely supported by what they're sharing."" Yasha Levine's take on the Twitter Files: ""One of the saddest things about them is that the people on both sides of this holographic media fight really are horrible, and yet we're supposed to get all emotionally involved in it and pick one oligarchic faction—either TEAM LIB or TEAM MAGA—and root for it like it's our lord and savior. All the while, nothing about this drama will have any real impact on anyone in America.

This means that with only a little uptick in price, the crypto can possibly retake the 14th spot on the list. However, it’s also true that the next-placed asset, Solana, is only minimally behind SHIB now, suggesting that if the meme coin continues to do poorly, it will easily tumble further down the list. Dogecoin has also been struggling recently, but despite its 10% decline in the past week, the coin is still comfortably sitting at the 8th position in the list, with more than double the market cap of SHIB.

Source: TradingViewBTC price rebounds as U.S. inflation slowsData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting $18,105 on Bitstamp after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) print for November came in below expectations.The readout, dubbed the “most important” of the year, even beat analysts’ expectations on inflation slowing.November CPI was 7.1% year-on-year, compared to the 7.3% forecast. Month-on-month was 0.1% versus the 0.3% expected.“The all items index increased 7.1 percent for the 12 months ending November; this was the smallest 12-month increase since the period ending December 2021,” an accompanying press release confirmed.Bitcoin traders and analysts were unsurprisingly buoyed by the injection of positivity which resulted.“Massive short squeeze on its way in the market,” popular analytics resource Game of Trades responded in part of a tweet prior to the Wall Street open.A more conservative reaction came from Il Capo of Crypto, who told followers that he still did not plan BTC exposure despite the gains.“CPI better than expected, but still very high,” he said. “Price is testing a massive resistance zone here and forming a lower high. I’m still 100% out of the market.”Similarly cautious was Fejau, an analyst at crypto research firm, Reflexivity Research, who warned of “deflationary panic” yet to come.“We now enter the complacent Goldilocks phase of inflation,” he announced:“Cpi coming down faster than expected is bullish up until it turns into a deflationary panic in Q1 2023. Final low around then then bullish into 2024. Enjoy you long gains but don’t miss the forest from the trees.”As Cointelegraph reported, the week is set to contain more than just CPI numbers, with the U.S. Federal Reserve due to decide on December’s interest rate hike and Chair Jerome Powell to speak on Dec. 15. According to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, consensus was for a lower 50-basis-point hike on the day, with the odds at just under 80% versus 75% at the start of the week.Fed target rate probabilities chart.

It was distributed through a fake one-page website containing only two buttons.""ERMAC and DroppersThese buttons acted as download links for Android versions of ERMAC-developed “dummy” applications, which are useless to the end user but are designed to log keystrokes, as well as steal two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, email credentials and bitcoin wallet seed phrases, amongst other things.However, while some of the malicious apps available from the platform are likely the responsibility of core ERMAC developer DukeEugene, the team also found that some of the apps were disguised as legitimate instances of the Instagram app, as well as other applications that have listings on the Google Play Store.As is often the case with malware campaigns, a “dropper” obtained from the dark web is being used by the threat actors so their apps can evade detection, in this case, Zombinder. Droppers install what is functionally a clean version of the app, but then present users with an update that then contains the malware.This is a clever delivery system as, particularly with apps that purport to be from common, “trusted” vendors like Meta, as users are more likely to install an update from app developers they recognise.This particular dropper service was announced in March 2022 and, according to ThreatFabric, has already become popular with a number of threat actors.Read more> Check out our list of the best identity theft protection right now> These fake Android antivirus apps install a dangerous banking trojan> These two dangerous Trojan 'dropper' Android apps have already been installed thousands of times“Dropper” attacks are largely made possible because of the “open” nature of Android allowing users to “sideload” apps obtained from repositories other than the Google Play Store, and even from app developers themselves. While this open ecosystem benefits security-conscious users, users seeing it purely as a means of pirating applications that usually cost money, for instance, can become easy pickings for threat actors armed with banking trojans, who are then free to steal data, credentials and even money from innocent users. Here’s our list of the best firewalls right now ",2022-12-13

This news sent a few tremors through the crypto community but doesn’t seem to be very serious according to the exchange. USDC is a stablecoin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar. It is one of the most popular stablecoins used as a medium of exchange in the crypto world. The decision to halt USDC withdrawals was made due to “technical difficulties”. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance tweeted:  On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals. However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD. The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open. 1/2 — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 2022    The Binance CEO also tweeted out his belief that his exchange is receiving a huge amount of FUD. He expressed annoyance but said that in spite of the negativity Binance was still growing.  FUD helps us grow, even though they are thoroughly annoying. You can FUD about someone without explicitly mentioning their name, which spreads awareness.It also helps unite their supporters because it forms a common defense alliance.Short thread. 1/4 https://t.co/PlxhqV5cZS — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 2022    Opinion The news of USDC withdrawals being halted does appear to have had far more negativity than would probably be the case normally. Up until very recently Binance was generally considered to be a model of stability in the crypto space, and it does seem a little odd that there is so much FUD being directed its way over recent days. The crypto industry is in a vulnerable state, with the bear market extending for longer than many had anticipated. The FUD over Binance halting USDC withdrawals could be seen as a further sign that those wishing the sector ill might be trying to topple one of the biggest dominoes in the hope that this will bring crypto down for a long, long time to come.

The higher the score, the more consistent the behavior of the asset’s price in the past.History doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes. The VORTECS™ Score was created to provide every crypto market participant with high-quality, quantitative analysis that has previously only been available to major institutional investors.NewsQuakes™NewsQuakes™ is an indicator that delivers real-time alerts generated by developments that impact coin prices the most. These include exchange listings, staking announcements and partnerships.Our research has found that exchange listings, staking announcements and partnership announcements have had the most consistently positive impact.NewsQuakes™ are built on top of The Tie’s proprietary SigDev technology — the most comprehensive and actionable digital asset information platform for tracking real-time, market-moving news in the cryptocurrency space.SigDev is used by major hedge funds, over-the-counter desks, market makers and other institutional market participants to gain an edge. In addition to financial institutions, news outlets like Cointelegraph use The Tie’s SigDev platform to identify critical breaking news stories from primary sources.NewsQuakes™ are delivered both in-browser via Discord alerts and directly to your phone via the Markets Pro mobile application. Among the most notable NewsQuakes™ are new exchange listings.For example, since the launch of our NewsQuakes™ indicator in Jan. 2021, buying and holding a token for one hour after its NewsQuakes™ listing announcement generated a whopping 12,000% return! Some notable NewsQuakes™ over the past month include our alert on Mask Network (MASK) after the announcement that MASK would be listed on Binance.The yellow dot illustrates when the alert was sent to community members...Just four days after the alert, MASK rose from $2.67 to a high of $3.93. Similarly, three NewsQuake alerts were sent to our clients about Marinade (MNDE), the last two served up a one-day move from $0.07 to a high of $0.30, translating to a 307% intraday move.Meaning, had you invested $1,000 into this alert, you would’ve had $3,070 by the end of the day.$10,000? $30,700!VORTECS™ performanceSince the launch of the algorithm on January 5, 2021, Cointelegraph Markets Pro has been tracking the performance of 45 different trading strategies on an hourly basis over a rolling week and a cumulative history.The trading strategies are divided into two groups: time-based and score-based.In each case, Markets Pro tracks the performance of the VORTECS™ Score against the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin (BTC) and an evenly weighted basket of the top 100 altcoins — all to ensure that the score is tested for wider market movements.Time-based strategiesTime-based strategies involve tracking the performance of a crypto asset from the moment its VORTECS™ Score crosses a key threshold until a specific time period elapses, for example, Buy 80/Sell 168 hours or Buy 90/Sell 24 hours.From the beginning of 2021 until now, the 13 winning time-based strategies tracked by Markets Pro have averaged gains of 546.35%. In comparison, a BTC buy-and-hold strategy suffered a loss of 39.44%, and a similar strategy with the top 100 altcoins gained a return of 190.15%.The most successful of these strategies has been the Buy 80/Sell 24 hours strategy, which has returned 1,123.46% since the beginning of 2021!Even the least successful time-based strategy, Buy 80/Sell 168 hours, returned 290.70%.Score-based strategiesScored-based strategies involve tracking the performance of a crypto asset from the moment its VORTECS™ Score crosses a key threshold until it reaches another key threshold, for example, Buy 80/Sell 75 or Buy 90/Sell 65.The 12 winning score-based strategies tracked by Markets Pro yielded an average return of 2,895.49%, eclipsing the 190.15% return achieved by buying and holding the top 100 altcoins on the market by a factor of 15. The most successful of these strategies has been the Buy 80/Sell 20 score, which has returned 21,010.61% since the beginning of 2021!Even the least successful score-based strategy, Buy 85/Sell 85, returned 263.63%. Evidently, even the worst-performing successful score-based strategy beat the buy-and-hold strategies for BTC and for the top 100 altcoins on the market.  Cointelegraph Markets Pro is available exclusively to members at $99 per month with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

The term “Ponzi scheme” or “pyramid scheme” is familiar as an investing scam in which money from a constant stream of new investors is used to pay off earlier investors while simultaneously enriching the scheme’s creator.    The scheme or scam continues until, as is always the case, it collapses when there are no more new investors. Although Ponzi was not the first to utilize this scam to make money, he’s the most famous and therefore the one for whom it is named.      Key Takeaways  Charles Ponzi is the namesake for the Ponzi scheme, sometimes referred to as the “Rob Peter to pay Paul” scheme in use for many years before Ponzi employed it.The Ponzi scheme, which involves paying off early investors with proceeds from later investors, typically collapses when no more new investors can be attracted.Ponzi was born in Lugo, Italy, on March 3, 1882.His early life was an unremarkable mishmash of menial jobs and criminal enterprise.By accident, he discovered a way to use international reply coupons and discrepancies in foreign exchange rates to make money.Turning that process into a scheme made him infamous when the scheme adopted his name.      Early Life and Education    Charles Ponzi was born Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi on March 3, 1882, in the town of Lugo in northern Italy. His parents, Oreste and Imelda Ponzi, Ponzi later said, were part of a wealthy Italian family that had become borderline poor by the time he was born. Ponzi is said to have expressed criminal tendencies early on, stealing from his parents and even parish priests.    As a young man, he attended Sapienza University in Rome, where, by his own account, he was less than a model student. As a result, after four years, Ponzi was forced to leave with no money and no degree. During his university years, he had heard stories of other Italians who went off to America to find fame and fortune and decided that this was the only course left open for him.       Coming to America    Ponzi arrived in Boston in November 1903 aboard the S.S. Vancouver. In his autobiography, The Rise of Mr. Ponzi, he claimed that he left Italy with $200 but arrived in America with far less. “The $200 had dwindled down to $2.50 on the way over and a card sharp had taken me for most of it and the tips and the bar the rest of it,” wrote Ponzi. Over the next few years, Ponzi managed to learn English and perform odd jobs.    In The Rise of Mr. Ponzi, the self-styled jack-of-all-trades explained it like this: “I tried my hand at everything. From grocery clerk to road drummer. From sewing machine repair man to insurance salesman. From factory hand to kitchen and dining room help. In some of the jobs I lasted no time. In others, I lasted longer. Often, I would be fired. Oftener, I would quit of my own accord either disgusted or to avoid being fired.” In his personal account, Ponzi fails to mention the reason for some of those firings including theft and shortchanging customers.    After moving to several cities, including Pittsburgh, New York, New Haven, Conn., and Providence, R.I., he ended up in Montreal, Canada, where he worked as a bank teller. He lost that job when the bank went under. As was often the case with Ponzi, he turned back to crime, which resulted in a three-year stretch in prison in Quebec for forgery. After release, he began helping smuggle Italian immigrants into the United States. This was followed by two more years in prison in Atlanta after getting caught at that endeavor.      An American Beauty    Back in Boston on Memorial Day weekend 1917, Ponzi, now 35 years old, noticed a young girl on a streetcar platform. “One glance at her,” he later wrote, “at that picture of loveliness and kindness and clean vivacity! One look into her deep, dark, smiling eyes! At that pretty, round face, framed in a background of gorgeous curls!...I was no longer able to remove my eyes from her.”    Her name was Rose Gnecco, and in February 1918, they were married. For the next few months, Ponzi worked at several jobs including his father-in-law’s grocery store, an import-export company, and his wife’s family’s fruit company, which failed shortly after.    Rose was by Charles’s side through the tough times and during the dizzying ride to riches, including a 12-room mansion, servants, and a custom-built limousine. She stayed with him when the scheme failed and even when he went to jail for mail fraud and beyond that for two years after his deportation. They finally divorced in the mid-1930s.      Simple Arbitrage    In 1919, after having set himself up in a small export-import business, Ponzi received a letter from a Spanish company requesting an advertising catalog. Inside the envelope, he found an international reply coupon (IRC), a type of voucher accepted in various other countries in exchange for local postage stamps. Ponzi quickly realized the moneymaking potential of taking advantage of exchange-rate differences to buy IRCs in one country and redeem them in another.    In his own flowery prose, Ponzi described that moment: “The ‘racket’ of international reply coupons actually fell in my lap like a ripe apple. I did not have to shake the tree to get it. I just reached over, where it had fallen, and took it. It looked good. Luscious. I examined it for flaws. Found none. I had to bite. I wouldn’t have been human if I didn’t.”    At this point, Ponzi had discovered a practice known as arbitrage—the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in two different markets. Tiny differences in price allow for a modest profit. In this case, buying IRCs in Italy for one price and exchanging them for higher-priced postage stamps in the U.S. would create significant profit when done at scale. If Ponzi had stopped there, he likely would have been free and clear.       One of the first practitioners of what later came to be called the Ponzi scheme was a woman named Sarah Howe, who started Ladies’ Deposit Co., a savings bank targeted toward unmarried women in Boston in the late 1870s. Howe promised an interest rate of 8% per month, which she pulled off by paying early depositors with funds from new customers. This is the very definition of a Ponzi scheme.       The Scheme    In 1920, Ponzi organized a company called Securities Exchange Co. in which he sold stock (promissory notes) advertising 50% interest after 90 days. The funds obtained from investors were supposed to be used to buy IRCs to redeem in the U.S. Instead, Ponzi used funds obtained from new investors to pay off old investors.    By way of explaining why he did this, Ponzi blamed the Universal Postal Union for suspending the sale of IRCs once it learned about his coupon redemption scheme. After attempting to get around the suspension, Ponzi shifted to his “Rob Peter to pay Paul” scheme. For a while, it worked. He raked in $15 million ($220 million in 2022 dollars) in the first eight months of 1920. He kept the scheme going by telling investors he had created an elaborate network of agents buying IRCs for him overseas that he could redeem in the U.S. for a tidy profit. In fact, there was no elaborate network of coupon buyers; he was using new investments to pay off old investors.       As of Jan. 27, 2013, the U.S. Postal Service no longer sells IRCs. International reply coupons purchased in other countries may be exchanged in the U.S. for a First-Class Mail International 1-ounce, letter-size stamp per coupon.       How It All Ended    In July 1920, the Boston Post ran a flattering front-page feature on Ponzi pegging his net worth at $8.5 million. Less than a week later, the U.S. Post Office Department announced new conversion rates for international postal reply coupons, though officials said the rate change had nothing to do with Ponzi.    Investigations of Ponzi ensued but made little progress until the Boston Post launched its own investigation, which generated bad press, causing Ponzi to decline to accept new investments. This caused a run by current investors, and Ponzi reportedly paid out more than $1 million.    More bad press from the Post ultimately sealed Ponzi’s fate. He was eventually convicted on federal charges of mail fraud and served 3½ years in prison. Upon parole, he was convicted of state charges, jumped bail, was caught, and went to prison again, getting out in 1934. At that time, he was deported to his native Italy, having never become a U.S. citizen. His history in Italy and Brazil is not well documented, though it is known that he died on Jan. 18, 1949, in a charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, leaving just $75 to pay for his burial.     How much did Charles Ponzi steal from investors? In eight months in 1920, Ponzi raked in an estimated $15 million ($220 million today) by persuading thousands of Bostonians that he could make them rich.     What happened to Charles Ponzi after he was deported from the United States? Accounts vary, but one of the most likely has him going to Brazil from Italy to run a fledgling airline that was ferrying supplies to Italy during World War II. According to that account, once the United States entered the war, it and the government of Brazil shut down the airline. Ponzi taught English and French and worked as an interpreter. He died, nearly broke, on Jan. 18, 1949, in a charity hospital in Brazil.     What are some of the largest Ponzi schemes in recent years? Six of the best known and largest Ponzi schemes of the 20th and 21st centuries include:2016–2018: Bitconnect’s cryptocurrency investment program scam ended with a market capitalization of $2.6 billion.2012: Allen Stanford conducted a Ponzi scheme through his Stanford International Bank that scammed investors out of $7 billion.2008: Tom Petters stole $3.65 billion through his firm, Petters Co. Inc.2008: Bernie Madoff, former chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange, scammed investors out of $65 billion, making it the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.1994–2003: Mutual Benefits Co. conned 28,000 terminally ill people out of $1 billion in one of the most egregious Ponzi schemes of all time.      The Bottom Line    Charles Ponzi was the most flamboyant early practitioner of a scheme where the fraudster creates a plausible investment, gathers investors, then uses the money from older investors to pay off newer ones, while raking in a tidy profit. He wasn’t the first one to think of this, but he is the person who gave his name to this practice—the same technique notoriously employed by Bernie Madoff, who stole $65 billion. Ponzi is held responsible for stealing an estimated $15 million (worth $220 million today).  ",2022-12-13

It put the real money toward facilitating trades of less-real money, which generated profits whether crypto values went up or down. It raised still more cash from venture-capital firms on the premise of an 11-figure valuation that has now gone to zero. And it used funds flowing in from customers to finance risky bets, simultaneously losing the money and making profits off the trades.“Dollars are fungible with each other,” Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of FTX, said recently to explain how money wired to company accounts could b used for more than one purpose. “And so it’s not like there’s this $1 bill over here that you can trace through from start to finish.”AdvertisementOf course, in properly run companies, you absolutely can trace the flow of funds and avoid using the same dollars twice, fungible as they may be. Bankman-Fried’s empire, encompassing the crypto exchange FTX, hedge fund Alameda Research, and a labyrinth of subsidiaries, was clearly skilled at making dollars multitask. That trick was the source of both its spectacular, five-year rise to the top of the crypto industry and its even more incredible, five-day fall.It’s also at the heart of fraud charges against Bankman-Fried, who was arrested on Dec. 12 in the Bahamas, where he’s expected to be extradited to the US. He is facing criminal charges of fraud and money laundering. A civil complaint against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Bankman-Fried of diverting customer funds and lying to investors “from the start.”But there’s another way in which FTX was able to make and lose money simultaneously, which hasn’t been previously reported. And incredibly enough, this trick was and remains perfectly legal for investments that are subject to US taxes. It allowed FTX to rack up billions of dollars of tax deductions, by losing money, while otherwise running a profitable business.An enormous loopholeIn fact, the tax-avoidance strategy may prove to have generated the only lasting value created by FTX, which put its entire empire into bankruptcy a month ago. Court filings by FTX’s new leadership show the company claimed more than $4.4 billion in federal and state tax deductions, as of the end of 2021, which could be valuable if the company emerges from bankruptcy.AdvertisementNOL means net operating loss.Screenshot: QuartzThe source of those losses hasn’t been explained, but a review of the public record, supported by interviews with former FTX insiders and accounting experts, points in one clear direction: aggressive use of tax-loss harvesting, leveraging rules that favor crypto investors and corporations to stretch an anodyne practice of traditional finance to the point of absurdity.Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund Alameda exploited a huge loophole in US tax rules that allows crypto traders to book losses on paper that can be used to offset actual gains. The approach rests on a tax-avoidance strategy so brazen that the US banned its use with stocks and other securities 86 years ago. The scheme is simple, legal, and widely used by crypto traders ranging from novices on Coinbase to institutional investors like Alameda. Two people familiar with Alameda prior to its collapse, who requested anonymity, said the hedge fund aggressively used strategies like those described here to book losses on paper while also generating profits in real life. Much of this was done with a trading algorithm baked into Alameda’s code, the people said.AdvertisementHow the scheme works Let’s say you bought one bitcoin for $40,000 at the beginning of this year. Maybe you watched the Super Bowl ads, and came away thinking fortune favors the brave. And it sure felt that way until mid-year, when bitcoin began falling sharply; it now trades around $17,000. But you are still brave and think bitcoin has a bright future, so you commit to maintaining the position long-term.Have your cake and take a deduction on it, too.﻿Here’s the totally legal tax move in the US: Rather than just holding onto your bitcoin for dear life, you sell it at $17,000 and then immediately buy it back. You have realized a $23,000 loss, which can be used to offset other income and lower your taxes. And yet you haven’t lost anything at all, really: You still own one bitcoin, and you can enjoy any future gains from the investment. Meanwhile, you get to pay less in tax and invest the savings.What you’ve done is combine two strategies:Advertisementtax-loss harvesting, or using losses in your portfolio to offset gains; andwash sales, or buying and selling the same asset at the same time.Tax-loss harvesting is a common and perfectly legitimate practice that helps delay taxes on investment gains, but not avoid them entirely. To ensure that’s the case, you aren’t permitted to harvest the loss from a traditional investment that’s in the red if you buy the same security 30 days before or after selling it, making it a wash sale. You can’t have your cake and take a deduction on it, too.The crypto wash-sale exceptionBut crypto investors can do both. They aren’t subject to any wash-sale restrictions in the US because the Internal Revenue Service generally considers cryptocurrencies to be digital assets, taxing crypto investments like you’re buying and selling property, such as art or computer supplies.There have been sporadic attempts to close the loophole, most recently as a way to pay for an unrelated wildlife-conservation effort, but supporters of that bill say its progress has stalled. A similar effort to close the loophole fizzled out at the end of last year, too.A new working paper out of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) estimates the US lost at least $10 billion in tax revenue in 2018 by leaving the wash-sale loophole open for crypto investments. That amount has undoubtedly soared amid even bigger bull and bear markets for crypto since 2018.AdvertisementThe paper, by economists at Cornell University, the University of North Carolina, and Tel Aviv University, also found that unregulated exchanges with lax compliance rules for traders had much higher levels of wash-trading as a percentage of total volume, using data through 2021. The exchange with the highest portion of wash sales? FTX.Widening the loopholeWith no wash-sale restrictions, crypto investors can harvest losses as aggressively as they wish, but there are limits—for individuals, at least.In the earlier hypothetical, when you bought one bitcoin and wash-sold it in order to book a $23,000 loss, you could use that loss to offset investment gains. But given how markets fared this year, you’re more likely to use it as a deduction from your total income. In the US, that deduction is limited to $3,000 per year for personal income taxes. Corporations such as FTX, on the other hand, face essentially no cap on their use of operating losses to lower taxes.That makes racking up losses a particularly lucrative strategy for institutional investors that are part of bigger companies, like Alameda Research was to FTX. The precise ways in which Alameda used wash sales couldn’t be learned, but there are a number of ways to legally stretch the loophole wide open:AdvertisementCrypto is volatile, so even tokens heading to the moon often have sharp downward swings, presenting frequent opportunities to harvest losses.Trades don’t have to involve fiat money to incur tax losses, which makes it possible to exploit volatile market prices in another way, by picking trading pairs that maximize paper losses and minimize realized gains.Because crypto assets often have very small markets, like a piece of art, but trade openly, like a piece of stock, a single buyer can essentially set the token’s price, which becomes the fair value for the purpose of taxes.Wait, FTX lost money?Despite all the ways to rack up losses, there’s still the issue of gains, which were in abundance at FTX until this year. Yet FTX claimed, on its US tax returns, it had accumulated $3.7 billion in net operating losses through the end of 2021, when the crypto bull market was still going strong.This was a company described by one of its investors, Chris McCann, a partner at Race Capital, as “profitable from day one—and not just a little bit, but extremely.” The crypto-exchange business of FTX reported $272 million in operating income last year. And while FTX accounting should obviously be treated skeptically, the company’s spending, along with Bankman-Fried’s, suggested the profits were real and denominated in dollars.Less is known about the income of Alameda, but it was believed to have profits from its early days in 2018 making arbitrage trades on slight differences in the price of bitcoin across different exchanges. That streak of winning bets appeared to continue through the end of 2021, even as some risky trades by FTX customers started to blow up in Alameda’s face.Plenty still remains to be unveiled about what went on at FTX during its five-year run, and that will certainly include corrections to its books and tax returns. But from what we know today, aggressive tax-loss harvesting appears to be the one trading strategy with any value to survive the crash.AdvertisementThe value left in FTXTypically, a company emerges from bankruptcy owned by its creditors—in this case, the hedge funds, lenders, and other investors whose cryptocurrency can’t be recovered from the wreckage of FTX. What they are most likely to receive, in this kind of bankruptcy case, is a slice of the company that screwed them.FTX’s customers are likely to end up with a slice of the company that screwed them.﻿But aside from some tokens found in couches in the Bahamas, and even assuming a complete rebranding or sale of the company for parts, what value could there be in FTX after gambling away its customers’ funds? It’s the net-operating loss carry-forwards, an accounting term so excruciatingly boring, it could explain why the whole issue has not received more scrutiny.Net operating losses (NOLs) are created when a company’s expenses and other deductions exceed its income. Typically, NOLs are considered a valuable asset unto themselves, because they can be used to reduce a company’s taxes once it starts generating a profit. AdvertisementLoss-making companies that emerge from bankruptcy are frequently sold so that new owners can use the tax deductions from the old NOLs. It’s only allowed if the bankrupt company, and thus the value of the NOLs, ends up in the hands of its creditors through a court-approved restructuring.The recent filing by FTX sought to protect the value of its NOLs by not running afoul of the complex tax rules (pdf) that govern the treatment of past losses once in bankruptcy. While the total amount of tax credits that can be carried forward is not yet known, FTX’s losses probably soared even higher during the 2022 crypto market crash and, ironically, the company’s own collapse.Screenshot: QuartzMany complications, audits, negotiations, and hearings stand in the way, but in a successful restructuring, the NOLs could plausibly generate billions of dollars in value for those still owed by FTX. Losing so much money will have been Bankman-Fried’s one saving grace for the creditors he left holding the bag.AdvertisementIn the meantime, the US is leaving open an egregious loophole that the rest of the crypto industry continues to exploit.",2022-12-13

America's more than 400 national parks and millions of park visitors benefit from the private philanthropy NPF and its corporate partners make possible. Partner support helps to protect these national treasures, enhance the visitor experience, and connect people to parks. Here are a few examples of the programs and projects that NPF's corporate partners helped support in national parks this past year:  Protecting Vital Ecosystems  NPF supported critical wetland restoration efforts at the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Jacksonville, Florida that will help improve coastal resilience at the park by implementing a nature-based solution known as a pervious oyster shell habitat. The new habitats will increase the resiliency of shorelines and coastal ecosystems, decreasing erosion, improving water quality, and helping to reduce the impacts of climate change.  Connecting Kids to Parks as Classrooms  NPF funded new and expanded learning opportunities to connect kids to parks through the Open OutDoors for Kids program this school year. Nearly $3 million in grants will support programs combining in-person, virtual, and hybrid park experiences for students across the country. Open OutDoors for Kids is offering innovative new pathways to make park experiences more accessible, ensuring more students are able to enjoy, understand, and connect with nature and cultural heritage in meaningful ways.  Engaging Historically Excluded Communities   In its inaugural year, NPF's ParkVentures program supported equity-focused outdoor leaders and organizations by providing grants for programs and activities to help people create and strengthen life-long relationships with national parks. ParkVentures granted over $1 million to 58 grantees supporting diverse leaders and organizations working to remove barriers for communities that have been historically excluded from parks, and to make parks more accessible and welcoming to all.  Park  Improvement and Accessibility  Thanks, in part, to corporate support, visitors to Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. will be able to experience new, state-of-the art exhibits, designed with universal accessibility in mind. NPF is helping to renovate Lincoln Memorial, which will involve design, fabrication, and installation of accessible exhibits, as well as enhanced security, modernized infrastructure, and improved visitor circulation. The project will also install a large viewing window into the dramatic undercroft below the Memorial, a space previously unavailable to visitors.   Keeping Parks Green   NPF and our corporate partners are also helping to make these national treasures more resilient and sustainable for the benefit of parks and people. This past year, NPF provided funding to install water refill stations in eight parks across the country and invested in renewable and alternative energy projects to enhance infrastructure resiliency, as well as recycling and waste reduction efforts to improve sustainability within national parks.  Making Parks More Climate Resilient   In 2022, NPF provided nearly $5 million to support service corps programs across the country. Many of the service corps programs are helping parks to be more climate resilient while at the same time helping people deepen their environmental stewardship. From addressing habitat degradation and invasive species to engaging in trail restoration, service corps are responding to the impacts of climate change in real time. The National Park Foundation would like to acknowledge and thank the following partners for supporting our mission to protect and enhance America's national parks for present and future generations: L.L.Bean, Nature Valley, Subaru of America, Tupperware®, Union Pacific Railroad, adidas TERREX, American Airlines, American Express, Arconic Foundation, Asset Marketing Services, BarkBox, Carhartt, The Coca-Cola Company, The Coca-Cola Foundation, Columbia Sportswear, EVOLVE Plant-Based Protein, Free People, GE Lighting, a Savant company, H3 Sportgear, Harland Clarke, J.Crew, Kinder Joy, Kohl's, Lenny &amp; Larry's, Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold, Niantic, Parks Project, Pendleton Woolen Mills, Publix, REI Co-op, Sierra, Stericycle, Sun Outdoors, Tango Card, Tom's of Maine, U.S. Park Pass, Winnebago Industries and Winnebago Industries Foundation.

The new generation investment has been making headlines despite the dreary cryptocurrency market. Cardano (ADA) Movement Under Pressure The value of Cardano (ADA) has seen unexpected lows amid the weeklong tale of the financial discrepancy of FTX. ADA has edged down 7.10% to $0.324887 in the past month, along with an 89.50% decline from its last year's peak. 2022 has not been suitable for the cryptocurrency market as compounded miseries have dented investors' sentiment. The sudden market meltdowns turned more intense after the dramatic FTX fall. Digital assets like Cardano (ADA) are under pressure as their utility is tied to traders' confidence in the market. Analysts now expected ADA to reach $0.54 in 2023, a bearish prediction compared to The Hideaways (HDWY), which recently flagged up to 40x ROI next year. In other news, Cardano (ADA) unveiled plans to launch a new privacy blockchain and token but still failed to support its price movement. Polkadot (DOT) Fades Price Value Polkadot (DOT) indicates a further downtrend in its price movement, obtaining negative sentiment from the broader market. At press time, DOT has remained negative in the 30-day timeline, translating to a decline of 8.80% to $5.56. The series of drawbacks on Polkadot (DOT) has signified the loss of positivity in the crypto space as investors exited risky assets in light of the FTX failure. Due to the weighing bearish pressure, Polkadot stayed behind from high price predictions for 2023, with expectations to stay at $6.72. This is farfetched from the anticipated bullish run of The Hideaways (HDWY) next year. The Hideaways (HDWY) Rises As Favorite Token After FTX Collapse Cryptocurrency values were crushed after the FTX exchange went insolvent, but The Hideaways (HDWY) popularity surged ahead, making it the most favorite presale token. The Hideaways has been making noise as analysts projected massive returns in 2023, supported by its lot of space for growth amid a small market cap of $45.00 million. The newest venture is set to deliver exceptional benefits that even Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot(DOT) could not provide. Investing in the trillion-dollar luxury property market is now easy, thanks to The Hideaways (HDWY). It mints fractionalized NFTs backed by high-tier real estate properties, handpicked by experts. The Hideaways presale is still ongoing, offered at $0.10. This trusted project has also passed audits from the German firm Solidproof, proving its reliability to investors. In addition, HDWY has established a permanent lock on the platform’s liquidity to highlight its long-term commitment.

On the other hand, The Hideaways (HDWY) has laid out a silver lining in the crypto community. The dramatic fall of the crypto exchange has driven XRP and MATIC investors to the presale superstar. Ripple (XRP) Endures Ripple Effect of FTX’s Troubles Ripple (XRP) has been tireless in expanding its platform’s presence worldwide, but FTX’s contagion has dissolved support for the American-based crypto company. In the past week, XRP has reported a decline of 15.30% to $0.382037, and it is about to close the year far behind its all-time high of $3.40. Correspondingly, Ripple is anticipated to end 2023 at $1.76. The shock from Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX sent leading crypto into a tailspin except for The Hideaways (HDWY), which has retained its bullish projections. Accordingly, Ripple no longer derives most of its income from the United States as it reaches Europe, an effort to lessen the dragging impact of the market sell-off. Ripple (XRP) was once the third-largest cryptocurrency, holding a $120.00 billion market value in 2018. However, XRP has declined sharply amid American regulatory scrutiny, which has unfolded a case from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Polygon (MATIC) Becomes Extra Bearish Polygon (MATIC) has experienced significant declines this week despite its exceptional performance in terms of both business and performance. MATIC skidded 19.50% to $0.864124 in the past seven days. Subsequently, the number of unique addresses on the Polygon network continues to gain, surpassing the 191-million-wallet mark. However, Polygon (MATIC) failed to protect itself from the FTX contagion, moving its 2023 price predictions to $0.93. Unlike MATIC and XRP, The Hideaways (HDWY) has resisted broader crypto factors. The new projects made waves in a revolutionary way in the real estate market. Why The Hideaways (HDWY) Could Be A Game Changer In 2023? The Hideaways (HDWY) stands out as a highly growing crypto investment, while Ripple (XRP) and Polygon (MATIC) have been struggling. At present, the new-generation investment is the safest project to grow your money as the venture places a high value on the security of the trader's assets with an audit from Solidproof. The Hideaways (HDWY) welcomes investors to purchase high-tier properties by minting fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFT).  For next year, crypto experts expected up to 40x ROI from The Hideaways, giving early investors the most significant returns possible. The Hideaways (HDWY) offers the best way to obtain passive income while holding your crypto gains. Now is the perfect time to invest in HDWY tokens when it's priced at only $0.072. Join today, and you'll receive a 30% bonus on your purchase!

The meme coin was able to see more than 2.5% gains at a time when the majority of the crypto market was struggling price-wise. Currently, DOGE is still standing at a good short-term level but $0.1 remains the level to beat for the digital asset. Dogecoin Gains Momentum The last 24 hours have seen Dogecoin establish some much-needed momentum in the market. It saw an increase in its price in the early hours of Tuesday, which pushed the digital asset right above the $0.099 price level. DOGE has now continued to trend along this line for the better part of the morning, although the increased momentum shows that it may be able to maintain it for much longer. During this time, the trading volume of Dogecoin had also risen to a peak above $600 million for the 24-hour period. This showed where the uptick in price had been generated from as well. It represented a 48% increase in trading volume, which was largely driven by whale transactions.                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  Related Reading: Cardano Community Expects ADA To Jump 50% By End Of Year, Is This Possible?

The Federal Funds rate has increased at varying rates over the years, and Jerome Powell has indicated a target benchmark rate increase of 0.5 points, which would make it a 15-year high of 4.25% and 4.5%. Federal Funds Rate Increases (Federal Reserve, WSJ) Because the Fed continues to tighten, many economists and investors believe it could spur a recession well into 2023, contributing to decreases in consumer spending and investments, layoffs, and curbed hiring. In a Wall Street Journal interview, Bank of America's Head of Global Economics Research, Ethan Harris, shared: âGetting inflation down to 3% or 4% should not be all that hardâ¦Getting close to 2% in the next couple years will be much harder and may not even be doableâ¦People donât understand this (2023) will be a very different recessionâ¦This is one where theyâre willing to deliberately create a recession, and theyâre not going to cut right away.â Fears of financial collapse and pain to portfolios have investors flocking to safe-haven investments like gold as âinflation insurance.â Gold, prone to this yearâs volatile price swings, is surging back and offers benefits that may make it an optimal investment. Is gold a good investment now? Supply pressures, the lingering effects of COVID, and inflationary costs are key drivers behind the rise in commodity prices, which include strong demand for raw materials. As economies slow toward contraction, investors tend to become defensive or go to cash. As a result of surging costs and higher-than-expected inflation, bonds have not performed as well as they usually do in a decelerating economy. As investors are unsure of what 2023 holds, investments like gold, silver, and copper â which have all experienced volatile price swings â are rising. And where the likes of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), aka âdigital gold,â has been compared and correlated to physical gold as showcased in the chart below, both offer safe-haven characteristics free from the decisions of central banks and government. Bitcoin vs Gold Correlation Chart (Bloomberg) When you factor in that three of the most significant investment houses, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachsâ are looking to a recession in 2023, gold is primed for a rally. Anticipating substantial volatility with a possible 25% decline in the S&amp;P 500, BofA stated: ""Our 2023 outlook is for a year of two halves: near-term downside risk amid a recession, earnings cuts, and QT / persistent inflation driving the S&amp;P 500 to as low as 3000, then a snap-back as uncertainty, rates volatility, and earnings revisions improve."" In discussing the S&amp;P 500âs 200-day moving average and target range of 4,000 to 4,150, Morgan Stanleyâs Mike Wilson stated last week: âFrom a very short-term perspective, we think 4150 is the absolute upside this rally can achieve, and we would not rule that out over the next week or so...Conversely, a break of last week's lows (3938), which coincides with the 150-day moving average, would provide some confirmation the bear market is ready to reassert the downtrend in earnest."" And as supply pressures exacerbated by Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine have pushed materials to the top of lists as a hedge against inflation, there are several reasons gold makes for a solid investment â pun intended.  Inflation Hedge â Costs are surging alongside rising inflation. As the Federal Reserve continues to hike rates, eating into the dollar, investors may want to consider investing in gold which often maintains its value and sometimes appreciates as the dollar depreciates. Gold has the potential to outvalue inflated paper currencies. Safe Haven â Weâve all seen the movies where physical gold is kept in a safe or safety deposit box. Physical gold is an asset that tends to maintain its value over time, serving as an insurance policy when interest rates impact other currencies. Gold is also relatively easy to buy and sell. Portfolio Diversification â To help reduce risk and undermine market volatility, a diversified portfolio that holds assets like gold tends to be negatively correlated with the stock market. Gold Prospecting â Locating gold is often associated with finding other commodities or minerals associated with gold deposits that can be very lucrative.  Although my three stock picks are down YTD, with the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) outperforming Harmony Gold and AngloGold Ashanti, getting ahead of a potential rally is better than being behind.  YTD Price Return of HMY, AEM, AU vs. SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD)    Year-to-Date Price Return of HMY, AEM, AU vs SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) (Seeking Alpha Premium) With strong fundamentals and tremendous momentum, the three stocks I have selected are all rated Buy according to my quant rankings, offering solid growth and EPS, excellent cash from operations, and stand to benefit from a contraction. 1. Harmony Gold Mining Company (NYSE:HMY)  Market Capitalization: $2.18B Quant Rating: Buy Quant Sector Ranking (as of 12/12): 33 out of 280 Quant Industry Ranking (as of 12/12): 2 out of 47  The largest gold producer in South Africa, possessing some of the worldâs premier and newest gold-copper regions, Harmony Gold Mining Company (HMY) engages in the exploration, extraction, and processing of materials and commodities like gold, uranium, silver, and molybdenum deposits. Headquartered in South Africa with additional operations in Papua New Guinea, Harmony recently announced the acquisition of a near-term project in Queensland, Australia, known as the Eva Copper Project. Despite the volatility in gold prices and increasing production costs, Harmony has been positioned well financially, allowing it to add a potential 10% to 15% more gold production in diversifying its revenue streams while increasing long-term value. Harmony Gold Valuation &amp; Momentum Momentum signals for HMY are strong and lean towards an upward trend. As we look at the three-month, six-month, and one-year performance, underlying figures support the overall A momentum grade.   HMY Momentum Grade (Seeking Alpha Premium) Not only is Harmony on an uptrend, but its valuation also comes at a relative discount, showcasing a forward P/E ratio of 8.21x compared to the sector median of 13.42x, forward EV/Sales of 0.86x, a difference to the sector of -40.42% and forward Price/Sales also a -26.05% difference to the sector. Despite a fall in EPS for Q4 2022 amid lower FQ1 gold production, revenue beat by more than 3%. HMY Growth &amp; Profitability Despite multiple mining operations and some of the largest gold deposits globally, Harmony Gold Mining has been grappling with lower FQ1 gold production after the closure of its Bambanani site and increasing costs but remains on track to meet 2022 production and its full-year guidance. By focusing on operational free cash, organic growth, and capital expenditure, HMY is on a mission to enhance margins. Harmony Gold Mining FY22 vs FY21 Production (Seeking Alpha Premium) HMYâs ore reserves and resources present vast mineral opportunities in gold and copper. With a recent investment in the Eva Copper Project, Harmony is expected to supply 65,000 tonnes daily to increase its free cash flow starting in 2023. According to Harmonyâs Form 6-K, Harmony posted solid results that included GAAP EPS of -$0.08 and revenue of $2.8B, which beat by $130M. After improving its operations for a 17% gain in operating free cash flow, Harmony Gold could be music to investorsâ ears, along with my next pick. 2. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM)  Market Capitalization: $23.17B Quant Rating: Buy Quant Sector Ranking (as of 12/12): 37 out of 280 Quant Industry Ranking (as of 12/12): 3 out of 47  Toronto, Canada-based Agnico Eagle Mines Limited is engaged in exploring, producing, and selling gold deposits in Canada, Mexico, and Finland. Offering quality precious metals a substantial production increase of nearly 816,800 ounces for Q3 2022, AEM is extremely profitable and offers a handsome dividend, sure to make investors happy. AEM Stock Valuation &amp; Momentum Grade Offering a C- Valuation grade, Agnico comes at a relative discount. Solid liquidity and an average 10- and 90-day trading volume near 3M indicates that investors are actively purchasing this stock, despite a forward P/E ratio of 32.80x and forward EV/Sales of 4.11x, which are a bit stretched. AEM Stock Momentum (Seeking Alpha Premium) Given its 1.38x forward price to book, a -28.86% difference to its sector peers, AEM is trading at a discount, but some prudence is required when investing at this price. Year-to-date, the stock is down just under 1%, but over the last year, the stock is up over 5% with a recent three-month rally, indicating the potential for a portfolio. AEM Growth &amp; Profitability Agnico Eagle showcased tremendous gold production for the third quarter, representing a 57% year-over-year growth. With an EPS of $0.52 beating by $0.09 and revenue of $1.45 beating by $15.82M, the company is on track to meet guidance of 3.2 to 3.4 ounces to close out the year, despite the headwinds posed by increasing costs amid the heights of inflation. Additional Q3 highlights include 817,000 ounces of production and a quarterly net income of $0.17. AEM Dividend Scorecard (Seeking Alpha Premium) AEM is a dividend aristocrat. Having paid shareholders a dividend since 1983, its forward yield of 3.14% offers a modest yet beneficial stab at inflation. In addition to debt repayments of $100M, Agnico offered $42.6M of share buybacks, including ~1M in Q3 and a quarterly dividend of $0.40. With continued development, a focus on remaining on budget, and new exploration projects, it should come as no surprise when Agnico Eagle President and CEO Ammar Al-Joundi said: âOn the operational side of it, we are targeting $130 million a year. I will tell you we have identified more than $130 million a year of opportunities, but not everything you identify happens. We remain confident on the $130 million a year. We said it'll take a couple of years to get there and we are going to exceed our expectations for 2022.â As Agnico CEOâs outlook remains confident in its company, I remain confident that my quant ratings have selected solid picks, including my final gold stock, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. 3. AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU)  Market Capitalization: $7.86B Quant Rating: Buy Quant Sector Ranking (as of 12/12): 40 out of 280 Quant Industry Ranking (as of 12/12): 4 out of 47  AngloGold Limited was founded in 1998 and became the first South African company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As one of the largest gold mining companies in the world, AU is an independent gold producer with shareholders that include some of the worldâs most significant financial institutions. Like the other two stock picks, AU has experienced volatility amid rate hikes and higher costs. Despite AngloGold trending higher as it trades above its 200-day moving average, some prudence is needed when buying the stock at its current price of $18.59 per share, given its âDâ valuation grade.   AU Stock Momentum Grade (Seeking Alpha Premium) Despite its current price, Angloâs quarterly price performance outperforms its sector median peers, and the company continues to reinvest in its global projects for growth. AngloGold Stock Growth &amp; Profitability Following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, Anglo has experienced some disruptions in supply chains and key supplies impacted by inflation pressures, including the oil and lubricants needed to operate and ammonia-related products like explosives and cyanide for mining. Despite these headwinds, AngloGold managed to increase Q3 production by 20% to 738,000 ounces from 613,000 oz for Q3 2021. With a solid balance sheet, nearly $2.5B in liquidity, and a free cash flow of $169M for Q3 versus the prior Q3 2021 of $17 million, CEO Alberto Calderon said, âWeâre focused on regaining competitiveness versus our peers, and we still have some way to go before we will be satisfied.â AngloGold Stock Q3 2022 vs Q3 2021 Total Costs (AngloGold Q3 2022 Investor Presentation) With strong cost controls in place to maintain its group guidance on total cash costs at $925/oz to $1,015/oz and for AISC at $1,295/oz to $1,425/oz, highlighted in its Interim 2022 Results Report: âManagement anticipates that most of these inflationary pressures are catered for in the current guidance range, we remain aware of the ongoing cost pressure experienced by the Company specifically and the industry in general. Total capital expenditure group guidance remains unchanged between $1,050m and $1,150m, with sustaining capital expenditure between $770m and $840m and non-sustaining capital expenditure between $280m and $310m. We continue to progress our reinvestment program aimed at pursuing key growth-driven brownfield projects across the portfolio.â As the company continues to progress and push for growth-driven projects, consider this stock with solid fundamentals for a portfolio and the other two gold picks, which may serve as an inflation hedge. Is your investment as good as gold? Many material stocks and commodities have been in global short supply. Investing in stocks that include precious metals is a unique way to try and capitalize on rising costs as an inflationary hedge and a way to diversify a portfolio.  Fear of recession is creating buy opportunities, and over the last six months, HMY, AEM, and AU have been on an uptrend. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, according to my quant ratings which take the fear out of investing, these stocks are rated buy, offering solid valuation frameworks and growth and profitability. Gold can be seen as a defensive asset, with gold stocks that could benefit in the current inflationary environment. Over the last month, as investors have been looking for safe-haven investments, consider Top Material Stocks.

Whether we know it or not, words carry a lot of power. So it's not a surprise that cryptocurrencies have always had an air of mystique associated with them. Adding to the secrecy is crypto's reputation for being the preferred mode of transaction for hackers. These associations, no matter how small one might think they are, lead to the ideas of secretive people in face masks studying dark screens replete with code and numbers in underground bunkers.The initial anti-establishment rhetoric of crypto doubtlessly made it a darling of Gen Z and younger millennials. But the industry is approaching an inflection point in terms of maturity. In order to survive and grow into its next phase, cryptocurrency needs to find its place in the common parlance of a much wider audience.The research group OpenSecrets recently reported that the cryptocurrency industry has increased its lobbying efforts and put $73 million into the 2022 elections. For industry watchers, it's clear that the crypto community is anticipating a regulatory crackdown, and the lobbying efforts are intended to moderate the impact. It's never been more urgent for the industry to be understood and adopted by a wider audience. But to achieve general acceptance, crypto is in dire need of a makeover from being a splashy high-risk, high-reward niche with tech-savvy 20-year-olds as gatekeepers.Doing away with the mystique — putting together the recipe for a crypto rebrandAs said previously, a name carries a lot of power, and a negative name can tarnish a brand or product irreparably. What happens when a company faces a scandal or completely changes direction? A rebrand. If any cryptocurrency wants to make it to the big leagues, it must find a way to rebrand crypto as a whole or distance itself far enough from the idea they are ""hidden"" or ""secret.""In fact, the idea that cryptocurrency is a secret way to transfer money is actually an oxymoron. The blockchain is made up of millions of public ledgers that are meticulously kept to ensure that every small transaction is visible to the people who have the right to see it. If anything within a block is changed, anyone looking at the block can see it happened. The blockchain is the opposite of cryptic, and everything associated with it — name included — should reflect the truth, so more people understand this.Lessons From Losing a Third of Crypto's Market CapitalizationThe recent crash in crypto valuation has given many investors pause. While a general market drawdown is hardly a novelty in the volatile valuation history of cryptocurrencies, the brutal correction from the all-time high in November 2021 to a 50%-70% correction in prices in 2022 (some coins corrected by 90% or more) goes beyond all rational risk-taking.There is no denying that larger macroeconomic factors were at play, including untamable inflation, the liquidity crunch and rising interest rates. Crypto also tends to follow the recent trends set by the stock market that continually trended downward throughout the year. But while other asset classes also suffered, few have experienced a drawdown beyond the point of no return, like Terra Luna.Crypto Must Appeal to a Broader AudienceNow that the industry is maturing, it is critical for cryptocurrencies to shed the air of mystique surrounding them. This means less volatility, more transparency and awareness. I think the best way to make cryptocurrencies more acceptable to the masses is to add stability by ensuring they will always represent value — for example, precious metals or the value of proportional fiat currencies.I understand that the core crypto audience has significant reservations about letting governments back currencies. One way to resolve this could be to back the currencies with a basket of the most-valued fiat currencies, including the Euro and Dollar. That way, the currency is not controlled by any individual government but, say, backed by the top five of the world's largest economies. The combined size and value of such a currency will be bigger than any exchange or cryptocurrency we currently have.In my opinion, lowering the volatility of cryptocurrencies by backing them with a basket of fiat currencies is the first step. The next step would be to make this currency exchangeable into cash at any time. This is critical in attracting a much larger, more risk-averse audience base beyond the high-risk appetites of 20- to 30-year-olds.The focus needs to shift from the cryptocurrency being able to break the sound barrier in reaching unimaginable heights of valuation to actually being stable and useful enough for the average Joe. We must make cryptocurrencies better than simply a tool for clandestine transactions far from the government's prying eyes. Cryptocurrencies need to become useful assets in the lives of common people.

The Bahamian authorities said the US is likely to formally request extradition. Bankman-Fried faces a litany of charges brought by three separate US government bodies—the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Bankman-Fried, or SBF as he is sometimes known, reportedly funneled customer deposits to his private hedge fund, Alameda Research, to place risky bets on faltering crypto companies. FTX halted customer withdrawals last month and sought bankruptcy protection.AdvertisementHere is a quick run-down of the charges and the possible penalties Bankman-Fried faces:The SEC brought two counts of securities fraud The SEC was the first to announce charges (pdf) against Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, Dec. 14. The SEC charged the former FTX chief with two counts of civil securities fraud. The government accused Bankman-Fried of violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. “We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chairman Gary Gensler wrote in a statement.If found liable, Bankman-Fried would likely be barred from serving as an officer of a publicly traded company and banned from issuing trading securities outside of personal use. Additionally, he could be liable for civil penalties.The CFTC brought two counts of fraudThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the country’s top derivates regulator, charged Bankman-Fried and FTX with two counts of violating the antifraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commission charged Bankman-Fried with one count of fraud and one count of “fraudulent misstatements” to customers. The CFTC has not yet released a statement on the charges.AdvertisementThe Justice department brought 8 criminal chargesUS Attorney Damian Williams, the lead prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, brought a litany of criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, including:Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customersWire fraud on customersConspiracy to commit wire fraud on lendersWire fraud on lendersConspiracy to commit commodities fraudConspiracy to commit securities fraudConspiracy to commit money launderingConspiracy to defraud the United States and violate the campaign finance lawIf convicted, Bankman-Fried faces the possibility of decades in prison.This article has been updated with the CFTC and Justice department charges.",2022-12-13

FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with defrauding investors.Binance, whose dominance of crypto was cemented by the fall of FTX, last week tweeted a so-called proof-of-reserves report by audit firm Mazars. The report showed its holdings of bitcoin exceeded customer deposits on a single day in November.The $1.9 billion ethereum-based withdrawals marks the largest daily outflow over a 24-hour period since June 13, the Nansen data showed, and accounted for the majority of the funds being pulled in the last seven days.""Binance's withdrawals are increasing due to the growing uncertainty about its reserves report,"" a Nansen spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Binance said ""People deposit and withdraw assets everyday for a variety of different reasons. User assets at Binance are all backed 1:1 and Binance's capital structure is debt free.""""We always have more than enough funds to fulfil withdrawal requests,"" the spokesperson added.Asked whether Binance had enough USDC to meet USDC withdrawal requests, the spokesperson said: ""From time to time we may need to top up hot wallets from our cold wallets, convert one stablecoin to another or carry out routine network maintenances upgrades, all of which can cause occasional short delays. This is business as usual.""Crypto news outlet CoinDesk reported earlier that Binance saw outflows of $902 million on Monday.The exchange is already under pressure from authorities. Splits between U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a long-running criminal investigation focused on Binance's compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, Reuters reported on Monday.The report sparked a drop of almost 4% in Binance's BNB token, traders told Reuters.""TOKEN SWAP""The Nansen data came as Binance halted withdrawals of USDC, citing a ""token swap"" - where digital token holders exchange their crypto coins, typically over different blockchains.""On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals,"" Binance's chief executive Changpeng Zhao tweeted at around 0820 GMT.Binance said in September it would automatically convert user balances and new deposits of USD Coin and two other stablecoins into its own stablecoin, Binance USD.Zhao said on Tuesday swapping USDC with two other tokens - Paxos Standard and Binance USD - requires using traditional dollars at a bank in New York.

I often get emails from proponents of crypto as an anti-monopoly tool, and a lot of smart people I respect believe that it is based on a groundbreaking technology that will sweep the world. I don’t see it that way. I think it’s a social movement based on a dangerous get-rich-quick scam. But there’s a tremendous amount of goodwill involved, and as with GameStop, the underlying driver of the energy in this movement is mass and legitimate disillusionment with liberal institutions who have failed to deliver.Matt Stoller is the author of the BIG newsletter, where a version of this article first appeared in 2021, and former policymaker who focuses on the politics of market power and antitrust. This article is part of ""Crypto 2023.""This weekend, I held a forum for paid subscribers on whether crypto is a useful anti-monopoly tool, and the debate got heated. I learned a lot, and after reading the comments I decided to write an essay, because it seems like there’s a lot of confusion about what crypto is and what it’s for. Dec. 8, for instance, there’s a hearing in the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on the crypto, with lots of talk about innovation along with warnings about risks and regulation. While useful, such traditional financial reform chatter obscures the far more interesting political debate that crypto has brought to the surface of our society about finance, monopoly and the state itself.To explain what is going on, I think it helps to start with a historical analogy, the state that always seems to be a critical ingredient of every financial crisis: Florida. In particular, Florida in the 1920s.In the early 1920s, just after a horrific war and decades of reform that ended in cynicism, a wave of speculation occurred around land in Florida. Thousands of disillusioned Americans in the Northeast sought to get rich quick, like the ""mushroom millionaires"" who had profited in the Great War that killed so many. These speculators used financial instruments and easy money, the equivalent of deregulation, to gamble massively across the economy. The mania became so insane that there was speculation over land lots in the city of Nettie, Florida, a city which later turned out not to exist. Eventually, the bubble popped. First, multiple hurricanes hit the state. The stock market did the rest by crashing in 1929. The result was tears, losses and decades of litigation.See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | OpinionAnd with that, let’s talk crypto. Cryptocurrencies are a social movement based on the belief that markings in a ledger on the internet have intrinsic value. The organizers of these ledgers call these markings bitcoin or dogecoin or offer other names based on the specific ledger. That’s really all a cryptocurrency is. There’s no magic. It’s not money, though it has money-like properties. It’s not anything except a set of markings. Sure, the technology behind the ledgers and how to create more of these markings is kind of neat.But crypto is a movement based on energetic storytellers who spin fables about the utopian future to come. In a lot of ways, cryptocurrencies are like Florida land that no one ever intends to use. It has value in the moment it is traded, but only because there’s a collective belief that it has some intrinsic worth. (There is a wide variety of ""tools"" in the crypto world, like [non-fungible tokens], smart contracts, and global computing systems, but they don’t work, and none of them have any use cases except speculation and money laundering, and even in their idealized form they have no use cases aside from doing stuff you can already do far more easily through existing technology, with a different permissioning model.)That said, the crypto narrative is one that anti-monopolists in general find deeply compelling, since both the anti-monopoly movement and the cryptocurrency movement emerged out of the financial crisis. Elizabeth Warren became a U.S. senator out of the crisis, and eventually pivoted to making the first call to break up big tech. Bitcoin was created on Jan. 3, 2009, a few weeks before Barack Obama was inaugurated as president. Inscribed in the code of Bitcoin is the following phrase, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Both crypto and the anti-monopoly movement are reactions to the destruction wrought by neoliberalism.Both financial crisis reformers and Bitcoin proponents believe that the existing financial order is a collusive arrangement between large banks who are supported by government power. Money laundering, tax evasion, criminal activity and fraud are fine as long as you are an insider in this system, and the Federal Reserve and various other government institutions will not only not stop corrupt insiders, but will subsidize and bail them out if necessary. Meanwhile, the rest of us have to live with foreclosures, high interest rates on credit cards and high fees for middlemen in every aspect of the economy.Indeed, it’s hard to see how our social contract is legitimate or fair. No one went to jail for the financial crisis, and the ongoing parade of scandals is nonstop. Just to take a random story that came out last week, several groups published a finding that the $11 trillion private investment industry is a haven for money laundering. We all know there will be no state reaction to fix this.So what is to be done? The traditional populist view is that we should reform our social order through politics, things like mass education, elections, and civic engagement. That’s how Elizabeth Warren sees the world. She wants to strengthen the state so it can restore the social order, one that will tolerate less cheating and will involve the rule of law applied to the powerful.The crypto response is different. The crypto response is to reject the social contract itself as irredeemably corrupt. Their goal is put pressure on the state itself by creating a money-like instrument outside of the public rule-setting capacity of the government. This is framed in the name of consumer choice, as in the state shouldn’t be able to boss you around and tell you what you can do with your money. After all, it’s yours. And anyone who doesn’t buy into this idea is inherently defending a set of collusive bailout-friendly institutions that we sometimes call liberal democracy.But core to having a state, even a democratic one, is the ability to ban things and use coercion to enforce such a ban. Societies and social contracts are built on cooperative mechanisms, but also barriers and enforceable rules. In this framework, the argument of crypto proponents makes no sense. It is basically, ""You can’t tell me not to have access to a money-like mechanism, even if the point of this instrument is to defraud people or engage in ransomware attacks, and even if we know that the ultimate endpoint is a giant collapse when people trapped in a liquidity crisis find out that there is no lender of last resort for Bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies. If you do, that’s tyranny.""In other words, skeptics of cryptocurrencies generally believe that cryptocurrencies are easily manipulated mechanisms to launder money, commit fraud, evade sanctions, empower dictators, engage in heavily leveraged speculation prone to collapse, and ultimately break the state itself. The response to this concern is easy – exactly how is this accusation any different than the existing order? Surely if insiders are allowed to cheat in our regulated banking system, then why should we treat it as legitimate? Why not build our own financial channels? Yeah, maybe it’s bad, but at least we’re not Goldman Sachs or AIG.That’s why I don’t think this movement can be dismissed as merely get-rich-quick mania. There’s goodwill and energy behind this movement, as well as a lot of wealthy cynics and scam artists. But the lack of legitimacy of liberal democracies is real. Increasingly, though, the arguments from cryptocurrency proponents are changing. They are saying they want to be regulated, they are not opposed to the state, they are just into technological innovation, and so forth. That’s why every witness in today’s hearing said they want regulation by the state. I don’t buy it.We’re in new stage, where some very scary people are taking over monetary politics. If crypto boosters sought aggressive reform of the existing financial order, democratizing the Fed, clamping down on big banks, and so forth, and said that until that happens, they will pursue alternative currencies, that would be one thing. But that’s not at all how the politics of crypto works. In Washington, D.C., those who opposed the bailouts and sought to break up the banks – the reformers – are the most skeptical of cryptocurrencies.See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | OpinionMeanwhile, the pro-crypto lobby includes men like Pat Toomey, the most pro-bailout and pro-Fed politician in D.C., and is financed by libertarian billionaire Marc Andreessen, a key force behind the rise of Facebook. Led by the leaders of Miami and New York City, a wave of mayors are actively trying to fuse cryptocurrencies to local governments, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez asserting that these are ""natural resources"" and telling voters they may never have to pay taxes.The amount of utopian [crap] and fake promises on a technology that doesn’t really work as anything but a speculative bubble and money laundering device should be a big red flag. Crypto is a movement based on the theory that the existing nation-state is a system rigged by billionaires, and the right response is to create a different and more corrupt order rigged by different billionaires, money launderers and dictators. It will, of course, all end in tears, ironically when the Fed ends its monetary stimulus, creating bubbles across the economy. That much we know. But how much ruin this movement engenders will depend on whether and how quickly we can restore the legitimacy of our existing governing systems.UPDATE (DEC. 14 – 17:30 UTC): Adds original publication date.",2022-12-13

The feds are expected to charge the 30-year-old cryptocurrency executive with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering on Tuesday. In his written remarks, Bankman-Fried also whined that his personal fortune, which he claimed to have hit $20 billion last year, had evaporated following FTX’s bankruptcy. “Last I saw, I believe my bank account had about $100K in it,” Bankman-Fried wrote. “I don’t know for sure, because I have been denied access to many of my own personal passwords, data, documents and accounts.”    Sam Bankman-Fried said his massive fortune is now gone.AFP via Getty Images FTX’s new CEO John Ray is still set to testify before the key house panel on Tuesday. Ray, a restructuring expert who steered disgraced energy firm Enron through its high-profile bankruptcy, described FTX’s internal governance as the worst he’s encountered in his career. Bankman-Fried fired back at Ray in his nixed written remarks and claimed to regret “giving into pressure” to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at FTX last month.        see also             Members of Congress question timing of Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest       “I have reached out to Mr. Ray and the Chapter 11 team numerous times. Sometimes I’ve been requesting access to my own data, but other times I’ve been attempting to alert them to potentially important information for their jobs and duties to creditors and customers of FTX,” the testimony said. Bankman-Fried also claimed to have received “a potential funding offer for billions of dollars” just moments after he signed the paperwork clearing the way for FTX’s bankruptcy. The beleaguered FTX founder said he tried to rescind Ray’s appointment as CEO, but it was too late. House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said she was “surprised” to hear of Bankman-Fried’s arrest in the Bahamas on the eve of his scheduled appearance. “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,” Waters said in a statement. “The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.” During a Twitter Spaces interview on Monday, Bankman-Fried said he planned to testify via Zoom because he was “quite overbooked.” He also expressed concerns about “paparazzi” if he traveled back to the US.  Earlier this week, members of the Senate Banking Committee said Bankman-Fried had refused their request to testify at a similar hearing this week. The panel previously warned the ex-billionaire could be subpoenaed if he did not voluntarily comply. With Post wires  ",2022-12-13

But it’s also an opportunity to shine a light on some of the crypto industry’s worst practices. What we know about Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire is startling, and the situation gets bleaker with every new disclosure.FTX is likely an outlier in terms of mismanagement and apparent fraud within the industry. But the exchange, ​​once a paragon of trust in this industry, is also emblematic of what can go wrong when crypto strays too far from its founding principles. Its downfall is thus an act of creative destruction – and a path forward is becoming clear.Shlomit Azgad-Tromer and renowned cryptographer Matthew D. Green are co-founders of Sealance, a blockchain-based trust platform for cryptocurrencies. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.Crypto’s untamed reputation has limited its ability to grow (perhaps seen by the fact that this year’s contagion event didn't affect the wider financial system). For better or worse, the collapse of some of crypto’s most august institutions make it all but inevitable that new consumer protection and financial stability legislation will soon be coming down the pipeline.Rather than waiting for regulators to write rules that may not be effective, the industry should harness existing cryptographic tools to enforce compliance and demonstrate good faith. These technologies can ensure that users and regulators can continuously audit the health of various financial entities to prevent trouble before it manifests.Were controls like these adopted earlier, as they were in many decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols, the recent plague of illiquidity among centralized cryptocurrency firms could have been avoided.Read more: Ethereum Scaling Platform zkSync v2 Goes Live Amid ControversyJust look at FTX. At the most basic level, the company collapsed because of a mismatch between its assets and liabilities. The assets it had were mostly the FTT tokens it created. Blockchain technology could be configured to impose limits on such self-dealing by enforcing and maintaining programmable policies that prevent the overreliance on any one token. Yet instead of using the tools already in their toolbox, industry participants were allowed to cut backroom deals, rehypothecate funds and hide worrying information from their balance sheets.Blockchains, being fully auditable, can offer a window into a company's or project’s economic health. But this alone is not enough. Perhaps attempting to allay investor concerns, several exchanges have published so-called ""proof-of-reserves."" This is a step in the right direction, but also a false sense of security. Unfortunately, asset transparency offers no information about liabilities, thus falling short of true financial stability enforcement. And that doesn’t even get into the security concerns revealing information like this may present.Blockchain-based technology could solve this, too, by mathematically ensuring that appropriate funds are locked up and that asset/debt ratios remain within acceptable limits. Zero-knowledge proofs, a tried-and-true method by which one individual can prove to a counterparty that a given statement is true without relaying unnecessary information, completes the picture. Privacy-preserving audits can enable outsiders to monitor exchange assets and their resilience in the face of adverse scenarios.There is urgency for the industry to get this right and do so quickly. After all, using blockchain technology for financial compliance would be more efficient and much less costly than comparable compliance costs in banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), for one, has reported in the past that one in six of its employees works on regulatory compliance.Read more: Ethereum’s Rollup Race: What is a ‘True’ zkEVM?Regulation isn't only costly and potentially harmful for innovation, but also limited in its effectiveness. For example, in 2017, we learned that over the course of 15 years, thousands of Wells Fargo (WFC) employees had falsified bank records, forged customer signatures and illegally transferred depositor funds. Yet during this period, Wells Fargo was subject to an increasingly intense regulatory regime.While what regulation looks like is ultimately up to policymakers, they could consider using blockchain technology to create a certification standard that meets these lawmakers’ criteria. Crypto firms in compliance with this tech-forward standard would be able to declare and prove it to their users and investors. Those entities that ignore this standard would also be known, and their users would be aware of their heightened risk.Crypto’s recent crises are disappointing, but they were also avoidable. We can use blockchain technology to prevent similar issues down the road, while at the same time enforcing compliance and inspiring market confidence. But without a course correction, the next domino to fall could be the one that cements perceptions and keeps crypto from fulfilling its promise of creating a more just, resilient and accountable economic system.",2022-12-13

Amid FTX’s failure and entrance into bankruptcy court, one of these subsidiaries appears to be relatively unscathed: FTX Japan. Assuming FTX Japan makes it through, here are some things that other nations can learn from Japan’s experience.J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.FTX Japan is a Japanese-based crypto exchange, formerly known as Liquid, that Bahamas-based FTX purchased in early 2022. Whereas the customers of most FTX entities are in limbo, FTX Japan says that it is close to paying out its customers in full:""We have put together a plan for the resumption of withdrawal service, which has been shared with and approved by the new FTX Trading management team. Development work for this plan has already started and our engineering teams are working to allow FTX Japan users to withdraw their funds.""Japanese customers' cash and crypto will not be bogged down in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings given ""how these assets are held and property interests under Japanese law,"" the exchange says. Meanwhile, the funds of customers of the flagship Bahamas-based exchange, FTX International; Chicago-based FTX US; and FTX Australia remain stuck in bankruptcy limbo.What is it about Japan that may end up allowing Japanese customers of FTX to get their money before anyone else?In brief, careful regulation of crypto exchanges.Spurred by the failure of Mt. Gox in 2014 and the 2017 hacking of Coincheck, both Tokyo-based exchanges, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) established a broad set of standards for crypto exchanges, or what it defines as Crypto Asset Exchange Service Providers (CAESP). The FSA is also responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchanges, and insurance sectors.Read more: JP Koning – Let's Stop Regulating Crypto Exchanges Like Western Union Here are six key elements of the FSA's framework for overseeing crypto exchanges:1. Japanese crypto exchanges must segregate customer fiat and crypto from the exchange's own crypto. That is, they can't deposit the exchange's own operating funds into the same account, or wallet, as their customers' funds.A separation of funds reduces the scope for fraud. For example, it would have been easier for FTX executives based in the Bahamas to raid customer funds held at their Japanese subsidiary if those funds were mingled together with FTX's corporate money.2. Going beyond segregation, Japanese exchanges must entrust customers' fiat money balances to a third-party Japanese institution – a trust company or bank trust – where they are managed by a trustee with customers designated as the beneficiaries.By interposing a third-party trustee between FTX Japan and its customers, regulators would have reduced the latitude for FTX insiders to tamper with Japanese customers' cash.Another advantage of a trust requirement is that it adds a layer of protection in the event of bankruptcy. Storing customers' funds with a third-party trustee prevents them from being diverted into a general pot where they can be claimed by an exchange's other competing creditors.Other countries are less stringent. Take the U.S., for instance. U.S. exchanges, including FTX US, operate under state money transmitter law. While some states do require money transmitters to keep customer funds in a trust but many don't, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Georgia. This lack of a trust company layer may be one reason why FTX US customers haven’t heard a peep about getting their money back.FTX Japan claims to be holding 6.03 billion yen worth of customer fiat in trust, or US$44 million.3. A more explicit bankruptcy protection stipulates that customers of Japanese exchanges are entitled to receive payment in priority to general creditors in the case of bankruptcy.Customers are creditors of an exchange. They own an exchange-issued IOU. But a crypto exchange may have other creditors including bond holders, bank lenders, suppliers or other subsidiaries holding inter-company debts. When an exchange goes under, all of these IOU owners are desperate to get some of the remaining crumbs. Putting customers at the very front of the line of creditors is a way to protect them.Compare the luxury of being a Japanese customer of FTX to the plight of Australian customers of FTX. To their horror, they recently found themselves competing with the parent company, FTX Trading, for part of the Australian bankruptcy estate.4. The FSA requires Japanese exchanges to keep at least 95% of customers' crypto in cold wallets. Because cold wallets are not connected to the internet, they are more secure against hacking and internal fraudsters.FTX Japan claims it currently holds 3,194 bitcoin (BTC) in cold wallets, as well as 16,418 in ether (ETH), 64.1 million XRP and a handful of other assets.Many exchanges in unregulated jurisdictions already use cold wallets (although probably not for 95% of their customers' funds). However, smaller exchanges may use other exchanges such as FTX to store customer funds rather than their own cold wallets.Australian exchange Digital Surge, with around 30,000 customers, recently entered into voluntary administration because it kept a significant amount of money on FTX. Huobi lost $13.2 million worth of customer funds that it had stored on FTX, while Crypto.com had $10 million in exposure.Japan’s 95% cold wallet rule helps protect against such losses, as does the following 5% rule:5. For the 5% of customer's crypto that can be kept in a less-secure hot [internet connected] wallet, Japanese exchanges must ""back"" each unit of hot-walleted crypto with exchange-owned crypto held in a segregated cold wallet. So, for example, if an exchange holds 5 BTC of customer funds in a hot wallet, it must hold another 5 BTC of its own personal coins in reserve, for a total of 10 BTC.The FSA refers to these reserves as an exchange's performance-guarantee assets. If there are any inappropriate leakages from hot wallets, the exchange's reserve must be used to make customers whole.6. Lastly, all of these rigid requirements must be verified by an external watchdog.Each Japanese exchange must undergo a yearly ""audit of separate management"" whereby a public accountant examines that each of the above requirements for holding assets are abided by. That is, the auditor verifies that all customer fiat money is being held in trust, that customer funds are segregated from exchange funds, that at least 95% of all crypto is held in a cold wallet and that the exchange is holding an appropriate amount of performance guarantee assets.FTX Japan customers haven't received their funds back yet. So we don't know for sure if they’ll be made whole. But initial indications suggest they will be. If so, credit goes to the six preceding protections afforded to customers of Japanese exchanges.In response to FTX's failure, many jurisdictions are already scrambling to fashion their own regulations for crypto exchanges. They should be watching Japan closely.",2022-12-13

The fund currently has about $10.7 billion of assets under management, a figure that’s down 65% over the past 12 months thanks largely to this year’s steep decline in crypto prices.The fund is trading at a discount partly because investors, while free to sell GBTC shares in the market, have no way to redeem their holdings in exchange for the bitcoin in the trust. And in the meantime they’re being charged a 2% fee.Negative sentiment surrounding the trust has swelled over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), might file for bankruptcy.Grayscale says it’s operating as business as usual, but analysts and Twitter posters have suggested that any financial ramifications for DCG might somehow, at some point, affect GBTC. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of DCG.)Pablo Jodar, a crypto analyst at GenTwo, a financial service provider, said that some “investors do not trust the information that Grayscale discloses about the quantity of bitcoin that they’re holding, which contributes to selling pressure.”He also said that a recent spate of deposit withdrawals from the big crypto exchange Binance may have dampened market sentiment. “The market is not trusting intermediaries anymore, and that is why you see investors moving money out of exchanges and financial instruments like GBTC,” he added.Grayscale is currently being sued by hedge fund Fir Tree to obtain details about GBTC in order to investigate potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest.

In total Bankman-Fried was charged with eight counts, ranging from wire fraud to money laundering to conspiracy to commit fraud on the United States, AP reports. He was also charged with violating campaign finance laws, a notable charge as Bankman-Fried was one of the largest political donors this year to the benefit of the Democratic party, as Breitbart News reported.

The investigation started back in 2018 and has amassed evidence that, according to some federal prosecutors, is sufficient to charge the company. Reuters reports that around half a dozen federal prosecutors believe the evidence collected against the exchange will be sufficient to back up filing criminal charges against individual Binance executives, including CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, other prosecutors have protested, saying that more crucial evidence is required to move legally against the crypto exchange. Other Departments Involved Besides the Justice Department, three other government agencies are involved in the investigation. According to the DOJ, money laundering charges against a financial company need to be approved by the head of the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS). Furthermore, the heads of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle and the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) must also approve before the DOJ can take any action against the crypto company.  Money Laundering And Other Charges Even though the company has recently revealed that its BTC reserves are over-collateralized, the Reuters investigation has revealed that the crypto firm has been financially non-compliant with AML laws. Not only did Binance fail to enforce strict anti-money laundering controls, but it also processed over $10 billion in payments for sanctioned individuals and groups and conspired to evade U.S. regulators. The company could be facing charges of unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations. The Justice Department will have the final say in whether to indict Binance and its executives, negotiate a plea deal, or drop the case entirely.  Criminal Charges Could Shake Market  Moving ahead with the criminal proceedings would be another nail in the crypto coffin. The industry has already been struggling in the wake of the growing inflation, the LUNA debacle, the FTX crash, and the many exploits by cybercriminals. Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have been maintaining one of the industry's few remaining pillars of support. Criminal charges at this point could prove lethal for the industry, which might not recover.  Reuters has unearthed that Binance has tried to keep the matter quiet. Indeed there has not been any news or reports of prosecutors deliberating about charging the company. The crypto company has argued that a criminal prosecution could wreak havoc on an already delicate market and has led to speculations that a conspiracy is brewing to destabilize Binance and the entire crypto market. Binance’s legal team has been meeting with officials from the Justice Department to work out a solution, including potential plea deals.  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a new interview w… [+2364 chars]",The Daily Hodl,"Prominent crypto capitalist Arthur Hayes is unveiling a massively bullish catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) that would allow the king crypto to outperform the equities markets in 2023. In a new interview with crypto strategist Scott Melker, the billionaire says he expects the Federal Reserve to finally loosen its monetary policies next year due to a gloomy macroeconomic backdrop.         “Next year sometime, I believe that the Fed is going to have to pivot. That’s mainly due to the fact that I believe that the treasury market and probably the investment-grade corporate bond market are going to become dysfunctional. What do I mean by that?  You have a bunch of supply with no buyers. The Fed is not buying, the Treasury is not buying – they’re actually issuing paper. All large foreign, non-US governments are mostly net sellers of treasuries so that would be Japan and China. If you see accelerating more deals of Middle Eastern countries selling their oil not in dollars but also, at least, the lowest recycling of dollars, less purchases of treasuries and yet at the same time, you have all-time high issuances of debt because the baby boomers in the US are aging. They have entitlements – social security, Medicare.  You have increased spending on defense. Who knows what this Russian-Ukraine conflict is going to lead to… Then, you possibly have a recession. The three-month, 10-year spread that a lot of the economists believe is the true recession indicator has turned negative, which basically means that the treasury market is telling us that there’s going to be a recession next year.  So what does the government do in a recessionary environment? They need to issue more money to provide that social safety net… I think sometime next year, the politics of the treasury market and the corporate bond market are going to dictate that the Fed, at a minimum pauses, and, at a maximum, starts adding dollars back into the market.”  According to Hayes, Bitcoin will likely rally ahead of his expected pivot. “That’s going to obviously be positive for all risk assets, especially Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the last free market in the world and so, therefore, it should pre-trade that happening. You’ll see Bitcoin rise before the S&P [500] does.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands for $17,147, up over 1% on the day.

In a statement released Tuesday, 13 December, cryptocurrency exchange Binance said that it is pausing USD Coin (USDC) withdrawals due to token swap operations. “USDT & BUSD withdrawals are available and unaffected. USDC withdrawals will reopen once the token swap is completed,” the exchange wrote on Twitter. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao acknowledged that the exchange saw increased withdrawals of USDC. CZ claims that there’s no risk to user funds. Rather, Binance elected to pause withdrawals because the token swaps involved going through a traditional bank in NYC. ""The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open,"" he said. CZ further insisted that there would be no leverage or margin trading involved in these swaps. “These are 1:1 conversions, no margin or leverage involved. We will also try to establish more fluid swap channels in the future. In the meantime, feel free to withdraw any other stablecoin, BUSD, USDT, etc,” CZ said. The swap operations seem connected with Binance’s earlier decision to cease support for USDC. Instead, Binance would convert USDC into its BUSD. At the same time, Binance allows users to withdraw USDC and any other stablecoins. The USD Coin is managed jointly by the crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Circle. CZ said Binance has a “commercial relationship” with Circle to convert USDC to BUSD at a one-to-one peg. Net $2 Billion Outflow of ReservesBinance initially saw outflows rise after reports emerged of a potential criminal investigation into the exchange. Over the last 24 hours, Binance has seen a net outflow of $1.6 billion. In the last week, that figure was almost $2 billion. The figures account only for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, and total withdrawals could be larger. According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Binance has $62 billion worth of crypto in its publicly provided wallet addresses. It’s important to note that almost 40% of its reserves are in its own tokens, BUSD and BNB. Despite providing its public wallet addresses, many investors are not convinced that Binance provides enough transparency. In particular, the wallet balance doesn’t reveal anything about the exchange’s liabilities. To quell some concerns, Binance requested a “proof of reserve” report from an auditing firm. The report showed that the company had a reserve backing of 101%, enough to pay all depositors. However, critics remained unconvinced. For one, the report only looked at a snapshot of Binance’s reserves on Nov. 22, 2022. Mazers, the auditing firm that wrote the report, noted that they “did not express an opinion or an assurance conclusion” about Binance’s reserves. On the FlipsideIt is unlikely that halting USDC withdrawals indicates Binance’s lack of solvency. However, questions arise as to why Binance and Circle need traditional banks to do token swaps. This could reflect how much crypto still depends on the traditional banking system. Why You Should CareDue to events earlier this year, investors have grown wary of crypto firms halting withdrawal operations for any stated reason, with many having fallen to the wayside in the days that followed. With the collapse of FTX and its subsidiaries, Binance is by far the largest exchange in the world, and the implications of any potential fallout would have a huge influence on the crypto markets. Wintermute and Justin Sun Deposit 253M USDC in BinanceHours ahead of Binance pausing withdrawals, big crypto players deposited USDC in Binance. The deposits likely gave momentarily respite to Binance but were apparently insufficient. On Tuesday, Wintermute Trading withdrew 153 million USDC from Coinbase and transferred about 150 million USDC to Binance. Traders noticed the transfer because of Wintermute’s track record. The trading firm was one of the largest market-makers in FTX. Last month, they made headlines for making the right call about the FTX collapse.  Wintermute took out their funds from FTX days before the exchange halted withdrawals and declared bankruptcy.  Later on Tuesday, TRON founder Justin Sun also deposited $100 million USDC in Binance. Binance’s CEO addressed the move, saying he wasn’t directly involved with the transaction. “This is part of deploying BUSD on TRON, I think,” CZ said. The deposit comes after Sun withdrew 33,9 million Binance USD (BUSD) and 15 million Tether (USDT) from Binance. At the time, Sun tweeted that the transfers represented “normal business cooperation” and did not represent any “judgment or speculation about the market.” ""In the future, we will cooperate more with exchanges to jointly promote the progress and development of the industry,"" Sun stated. However, not all those transactions follow this pattern, as trading firm and market maker Jump Trading withdrew over $140 million from Binance over the last week.

The suspects had been laundering gains from fraud and gambling across China.  During the arrest, police retrieved more than $41.9 million, 100 computers, and mobile phones. In September last year, Chinese authorities banned virtual assets for payments, crypto trading, and mining. As China intensifies its opposition to cryptocurrency crime, the authorities in Hunan Province have arrested 63 people for allegedly laundering about $1.7 billion through cryptocurrency.  The Hengyang County Police Department, through its official WeChat handle, revealed that the suspects, under the leadership of an individual identified as Hong, have been using crypto to convert their loot to U.S. dollars since 2018. Hong, alongside the suspects, had been laundering gains from fraud and gambling across China.  Further, during the arrest, the police retrieved more than $41.9 million, 100 mobile phones, and computers from the suspects. The recent development confirms the fear of critics concerned about using cryptocurrency for illicit activities. This is not the first time China has taken serious measures against cryptocurrency perpetrators. In June 2021, China arrested over 1,100 people suspected of money laundering using telephones and the internet. Further, also in Hunan, authorities arrested 93 people for allegedly laundering $5.6 billion through cryptocurrencies last September. Chinese Ban on CryptocurrencyCryptocurrency is struggling to strive in the Chinese government’s domain. In September 2021, the Chinese authorities banned cryptocurrency outright, forbidding the use of virtual assets for payments, as well as crypto trading and mining.  Initially, the government aimed to curb capital outflows and money laundering using cryptocurrency. The Chinese government has since promoted its Central Bank Digital Currency, facilitating around 100 billion yuan since August 31. The project is still in the pilot phase in 23 cities on China’s mainland, with plans to expand to more provinces in the coming months.  Notably, the ban has pushed virtual assets transactions to fall rapidly. Between July 2021 and June 2022, virtual assets transactions in China slumped by 31%. On the FlipsideDespite the ban, Chinese citizens still use virtual assets. As of October, China remains the largest cryptocurrency market in East Asia. This indicates that the government’s ban on cryptocurrency is ineffective. Why You Should CareThe steady movement of the cryptocurrency market in China is driven by individuals who engage in P2P trading. Nevertheless, the recent arrest of the suspects might usher in a strong wave of crackdowns by security agencies on cryptocurrency users in the country.

Bankman-Fried and other accomplices also purposely submitted inaccurate documents to lenders who sent funds to Alameda, according to the indictment. ""It's fair to say that, by anyone's license, this is one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a press conference in Manhattan on Tuesday. What to know about the charges facing FTX's Sam Bankman-FriedThe unsealed indictment also accuses Bankman-Fried of violating political contribution laws by donating to candidates and committees in New York under another person's name. Bankman-Fried made ""tens of millions of dollars"" in contributions to both Democrats and Republicans in order to sway public policy, Williams said.         ""These contributions were disguised to look like they were coming from wealthy co-conspirators when, in fact, the contributions were funded by Alameda Research with stolen customer money,"" he said.A lawyer for Bankman-Fried, Mark S. Cohen, said Tuesday that Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering his options.   The maximum potential prison sentence from these charges is 115 years, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for U.S. prosecutors.       Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried arrested, facing charges of defrauding investors 06:58  The charges come on top of fraud charges the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed against Bankman-Fried on Tuesday. The SEC has accused Bankman-Fried of commingling FTX customers' funds at  Alameda to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate  purchases and large political donations. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced similar fraud charges against Bankman-Fried and FTX  on Tuesday, alleging in a lawsuit that the company caused customers to lose $8 billion in deposits. ""Bankman-Fried's claims about FTX's sophiscated risk controls and other customer protections were simply bogus,"" Gurbir Grewal, the SEC's enforcement division director said during the press conference.   Prosecutors are trying to recover as much money for customers are possible, Michael Driscoll, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office, said during the press conference. ""This case is about fraud,"" he said. ""Fraud is fraud. It does not matter the complexity of the investment scheme. It does not matter the amount involved.""U.S. to seek extraditionAuthorities in the Bahamas arrested Bankman-Fried late Monday on behalf of the U.S. government for activities he allegedly engaged in while CEO of the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. He was scheduled to testify about FTX's collapse on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, but his name was removed from the witness list.The U.S. is expected to ask authorities in the Bahamas to extradite Bankman-Fried, which experts said is likely within the scope of a treaty between the two countries that dates back to 1931.Because of that existing legal framework, ""This would be a moment where one could strike while the iron is hot,"" Michael Parker, head of anti-money laundering and sanctions practice at law firm Ferrari & Associates, told CBS News. ""If Mr. Bankman-Fried, for instance, went to another jurisdiction, it could be more difficult, and so the Bahamas may have been seen as a friendlier jurisdiction from which jurisdiction could take place.""In pursuing the case against Bankman-Fried, Parker said prosecutors will have to show that he knowingly committed the alleged crimes outlined in their indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.       Sam Bankman-Fried facing likely extradition to the U.S. after arrest in the Bahamas 05:06  Renato Mariotti, a legal analyst and partner at law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, told CBS MoneyWatch he expects extradition proceedings to go smoothly, although Bankman-Fried might not appear stateside until early next year.   Prior to his arrest, Bankman-Fried had been vocal about FTX's failure. At a New York Times Dealbook event last month, Bankman-Fried said he was unaware of the extent of FTX's problems and denied that he deliberately deceived customers and other parties the company did business with. In court, defendants often deny any intent to commit fraud, Mariotti said, noting that such defenses are sometimes effective. But the FTX case might be different, he added.""The fraud here is so extensive that it will be difficult to portray this as a small detail that he overlooked,"" Mariotti said.""House of cards""FTX was one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges before it suddenly failed last month. Users withdrew roughly $5 billion of crypto assets in a single day as concerns mounted over the exchange's solvency.John Ray III, who stepped in as FTX CEO after Bankman-Fried's resignation on Nov. 11 after a long career that included overseeing the Enron bankruptcy, said in a House hearing on Tuesday that about $7 billion was lost in the collapse. Ray alleged that Bankman-Fried and others at FTX misused customer funds, contributing to the losses.Ray also said FTC ""failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people's money or assets.""""Bankman-Fried's entire house of cards started to crumble as crypto asset prices plummeted in May of 2022 and as Alameda's lenders demanded repayment on billions of dollars in loans,"" Grewal said.    The Associated Press contributed to this report.    Cryptocurrency                More                      Dogecoin surges after Twitter changed its logo from a bird to a doge        FTX founder pleads not guilty to bribery and other new charges        SEC files crypto fraud charges against Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, others        29 arrested after thousands swept up in cryptocurrency investment scam        NBA star Paul Pierce settles with SEC over crypto fraud charges                  More               Khristopher J.

He also stands accused of securities fraud, money laundering, commodities fraud, and violating U.S. campaign finance laws, as well as conspiracy charges. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday at the behest of U.S. prosecutors. The entire indictment is embedded below.The charges hinge on the idea that FTX was acting as a sort of slush fund for Alameda Research, and people were enticed to send money to the scheme by ""false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises"" over various communication media. FTX was well-known for its celebrity-driven advertising, including a Super Bowl ad starring Larry David, and splashy stunts like buying the naming rights to FTX Arena in Miami. U.S. prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried and others knowingly laundered the proceeds of their alleged crimes on FTX. In addition, prosecutors allege that they ""did knowingly and willfully make contributions to candidates for federal office, joint fundraising committees, and independent expenditure committees in the names of other persons"" in excess of $25,000. Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives are known to have discussed wire fraud—the charge he is now facing—in joking terms. Top executives reportedly had a Signal chat called ""wire fraud,"" and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison stated in a now-deleted Tumblr post, ""How do I signal my genuinely sweet and feminine nature on my dating profile? Should it go before or after the section on wire fraud.""In a prescient post, Ellison wrote, of U.S. regulations in emerging areas such as crypto, ""they are studying X closely and in another year they will emerge with a case against a bunch of people doing X because obviously X falls under some definition of wire fraud or something.""Prosecutors are ordering Bankman-Fried to forfeit any property or cash that can be traced to his alleged crimes, and if it cannot be recovered, they vow to come after anything else he has that can match the amount.This article was updated with additional information.  ",2022-12-13

In an indictment unsealed this morning, SBF was charged with mail and wire fraud, money laundering, and other crimes related to a scheme measured in the billions of dollars. If convicted on all charges, he faces a sentence along the same lines as the 150 years imposed on the notorious Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff.For weeks, the Justice Department did not have SBF arrested in the Bahamas, despite the widespread public clamor for him to be immediately jailed. There are three reasons why the DOJ waited.  1. DOJ Allowed SBF To Keep Talking And Implicate Himself The first rule of being under investigation by law enforcement is “shut up.” From the moment that FTX melted down, SBF violated Rule Number One daily. He went on the record in tweets. He was interviewed by The New York Times. His statements drove the bankruptcy attorneys representing FTX to publicly state that he was harming the company’s chances to emerge from bankruptcy.  When he spoke, SBF did enormous harm to himself and especially to his credibility. Questioned by Vox about prior statements regarding his philanthropy, SBF responded, “Man, all the dumb shit I said, It’s not true, not really.” When asked about “sketchy stuff” that he had done, he responded, “Each individual decision seemed fine and I didn’t realize how big it was until the end.” When asked about prior statements that he wanted “good regulations,” he admitted that those statements were “just PR.” Even worse, he went on, “Fuck regulators. They make everything worse. They don’t protect customers at all.” If SBF goes to trial, prosecutors will be able to admit each of those statements against him, even if he does not take the stand.2. DOJ Likely Had an Arrest Warrant, Should SBF Have Returned to the U.S.Although the DOJ was content to allow SBF to do damage to himself while he was holed up in the Bahamas, they almost certainly were prepared to arrest him—based upon a sealed (secret) complaint or indictment—if he had been so foolish as to return to the United States.SBF would have been taken into custody had he landed at any U.S. airport, or arrived at any U.S. port. If SBF had been arrested on U.S. soil, the DOJ would know that they would have the latitude to arrest immediately and follow up with a superseding indictment later. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried attends a press conference at the FTX Arena in downtown Miami on Friday, June 4, 2021.Matias J. Ocner / Getty  3. Preparing an Indictment That Satisfies the Extradition Treaty With the Bahamas Required Great CareHaving SBF arrested in the Bahamas required more care than an arrest on U.S. soil. The United States has an extradition treaty with the Bahamas. Under that treaty, an individual can be arrested in the Bahamas and returned to the United States for “an offense…if it is punishable under the laws in both Contracting States by deprivation of liberty for a period of more than one year or by a more severe penalty.” That meant that the DOJ had to be certain that any offense that SBF faced was a crime under the laws of the Bahamas, as well as the laws of the United States.In addition, the indictment used to get SBF extradited from the Bahamas limits the crimes for which he can eventually be tried. “A person extradited under this Treaty may only be detained, tried, or punished in the Requesting State for the offense for which extradition was granted…” So, the DOJ will not have the ability to supersede and charge SBF with different crimes, if additional investigation finds SBF committed those crimes.For all of these reasons, the DOJ was content to use the weeks since FTX failed to develop its case before seeking extradition.  So, Why Arrest SBF Now, When He Was Just About to Testify Under Oath Before Congress?Although I cannot be certain, pattern recognition based on 25+ years in criminal justice (including my time as a federal prosecutor) tells me that the DOJ does not like to be embarrassed. SBF was scheduled to testify, remotely, before Congress tomorrow. Having SBF testify under oath as a free man in the Bahamas—apparently beyond the reach of the U.S. government—threatened to humiliate the DOJ.My strong suspicion is that when the DOJ learned that SBF would testify on December 13, it set a December 12 deadline to deliver an indictment to the Bahamas’ attorney general, so as to avoid the optical embarrassment of SBF testifying to Congress from a mansion in a tropical paradise.As for SBF, he’s got nothing but bad options laid out before him. “SBF was scheduled to testify, remotely, before Congress tomorrow. Having SBF testify under oath as a free man in the Bahamas—apparently beyond the reach of the U.S. government—threatened to humiliate the DOJ.” 1. If SBF Fights Extradition, He Will Be Jailed In an Awful Bahamian Prison Until He Is Sent to the U.S.Under the U.S.-Bahamas treaty, SBF can fight extradition in the Bahamas courts. This process can take months or years. For example, Julian Assange (of Wikileaks fame/infamy) has been fighting extradition from the U.K. to the U.S. for more than five years. But, if he fights extradition, SBF will be incarcerated in the Bahamas prison the entire time.When people think of the Bahamas, they think of a tropical paradise, with white sand beaches, soft breezes, and pina coladas. Bahamas jail, however, is far from idyllic. According to the most recent report by the U.S. Department of State:“Conditions at the government’s only prison, the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDCS) facility commonly known as Fox Hill Prison, were harsh due to overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care. Conditions at the Carmichael Road Detention Centre for migrants were adequate for short-term detention only.”2. If SBF Insists on a Trial, He Will Spend More Than a Year in Hellish Confinement in a New York City Detention CenterSBF has been indicted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which sits in Manhattan. If SBF elects to go to trial, he will be held in pre-trial detention in one of two awful jails: either the Metropolitan Correction Center (Manhattan) or the Metropolitan Detention Center (Brooklyn).I previously detailed the hellish nature of MDC Brooklyn when Ghislaine Maxwell was held there. In my decades in criminal justice (as a prosecutor and defense counsel), I have found my clients would rather spend time in New York’s notorious Attica prison than serve in MCC Manhattan. Sam Bankman-Fried donned a suit and tie this week, abandoning his preferred hoodie and dark T-shirt for a hearing before the U.S. Senate. The lawmakers had summoned the 29-year-old multi-billionaire on Wednesday to discuss the regulation of digital assets in his capacity as co-founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX. OLIVIER DOULIERY / Getty 3. If SBF Pleads Guilty, He Will Be Sentenced to Considerable Time (But Might Get a Break Under the First Step Act)The Federal Sentencing Guidelines—which set a recommended (but not mandatory) sentence—for the fraud and money laundering offenses that SBF faces are driven primarily by the amount of the loss. Any loss over $550 million places a defendant at the top of the chart, and SBF stands accused of defrauding investors of billions of dollars. When combined with likely adjustments for “more than minimal planning,” “more than 25 victims,” acting as an “organizer or leader” of the criminal enterprise, the use of “sophisticated means” and conducting a criminal enterprise from overseas, the guidelines offense level for SBF will likely be far above 43 points.But, 43 is the maximum on the scale. At this level, the only Guidelines sentence is “life.”Because none of the crimes that SBF is accused of committing carry a maximum sentence of life, but rather terms of up to 30 years, he will be sentenced to a specific number of years. That was small comfort to Bernie Madoff, who was sentenced to 150 years for his fraud. If SBF pled guilty, he would run the risk of a similar sentence.  On the other hand, many federal judges have been loath to impose the harsh sentences called for by the Sentencing Guidelines on white-collar criminals. For example, the disgraced ex-Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes faced a Guidelines range of 80 years, but the Court imposed a sentence of only 12 years. SBF might meet with similar leniency, particularly if he pleads guilty and shows “acceptance of responsibility.”SBF will also benefit from the First Step Act, the sentencing reform enacted under former President Donald Trump. Under the First Step Act, non-violent offenders are entitled to good time credits that cut their sentences in half, so long as they remain out of trouble in prison. So, even if SBF were sentenced to 40 years, he would likely emerge from prison in 20 years, before he turned 50.Regardless, December 11, 2022 is likely to be the last night of freedom for SBF for a very long time.

For instance, it remains questionable whether or not crypto hotspots will continue to flourish or if there will be a decline in innovation. While it may be too soon to fully understand the impact of the FTX collapse, industry leaders within crypto-friendly geographies believe that the FTX failure will not hamper innovation. For example, Dubai — which has been dubbed as one of the most innovative regions for crypto and blockchain development — continues to see ecosystem activity. Most recently, The Algorand Foundation, the organization driving the growth of the Alogrand blockchain, hosted its second annual Decipher conference in Dubai. The event took place Nov. 29–30, just weeks after FTX former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down and announced bankruptcy. While a number of discussions circulated around the collapse of FTX, Decipher still attracted more than 1,500 attendees from around the world. Staci Warden, CEO of Algorand Foundation, told Cointelegraph that the United Arab Emirates continues to be a burgeoning blockchain capital. “This is fueled by a strong talent base in the region, a deep culture of innovation, and a diverse, engaged community,” she said. The main stage at Decipher in Dubai. Source: Algorand Even with Decipher’s impressive turnout, it’s been noted that the Crown Prince of Dubai has plans to invest $4 billion to help grow the region’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. This is expected to add 40,000 jobs to the UAE’s economy over the next five years, which is impressive given that the country is already home to more than 1,000 companies operating in the metaverse and blockchain sectors. Nilesh Khaitan, Founder of AcmeDAO — a Dubai-based platform that helps decentralized applications transact on-chain — further told Cointelegraph that rumors that the FTX collapse is impacting crypto hotspots globally may not necessarily apply to Dubai. He said:“It’s possible that Dubai’s crypto community has been unaffected in particular, or has even seen growth, due to increased regulatory uncertainty in other regions. Dubai may continue to see growth in its crypto community moving forward, particularly if the city offers a more attractive regulatory environment compared to other regions.”While Khaitan remains optimistic about Dubai’s potential, he pointed out that the region still needs to focus on regulatory clarity between the UAE’s central bank and UAE Free Zone regions issuing crypto-specific licenses. “This includes the establishment of a regulatory sandbox for crypto startups and entrepreneurs from the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). These challenges could be overcome through unified, strategic efforts by the government to promote Dubai as a favorable destination for crypto businesses and innovation,” he said. Other crypto hotspots within the Middle East have reported recent positive sentiment. For example, Tel Aviv, which is a known hub for startups, continues to focus heavily on developing the blockchain ecosystem as a whole. Recent: Decentralized solutions for climate change are key as COP disappointsOr Dadosh, co-founder and CEO at Ironblocks — a Web3 threat detection and prevention platform — told Cointelegraph that in Israel, there tends to be more interest in blockchain technology itself and building products on top of these networks. “The community here is less driven by crypto trading and speculations around token performance when it comes to Web3 and blockchain,” he said. This seems to be the case, as a number of cyber security companies were present at the Israel Crypto Conference (ICC), which took place in Tel Aviv on Dec. 7. Ariel Shapira, organizer of ICC, told Cointelegraph that while the event was not as big as last year, it still attracted hundreds of attendees. “While events like the FTX crash do have a temporary effect on crypto prices and projects’ abilities to raise funds, they never erase the optimism within the industry about blockchain as a technology. Crypto folks understand this technology is going to be transformative. They understand the bear market is temporary,” he said. Attendees at the Israel Crypto Conference 2022. Source: Israel Crypto Conference Given this, Eylon Aviv, principle at Collider Ventures — a Tel Aviv-based venture capital firm focused on Web3 companies — told Cointelegraph that he believes the Tel Aviv crypto community will actually see an acceleration in growth. “Perhaps the phrase ‘no such thing as bad publicity’ is true, as founders are now specifically targeting problems that have arisen from the FTX fallout.” In addition to Dubai and Tel Aviv, crypto hotspots within the United States seem to be pushing forward. For example, Austin, Texas, continues to attract a number of Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies. This was apparent during the second annual Texas Blockchain Summit that took place in Austin on Nov. 17–18. Main stage at the Texas Blockchain Summit 2022. Source: Texas Blockchain SummitWhile turnout for the Texas Blockchain Summit was not as large as last year, optimism for the future of the crypto industry was evident. This may have been fueled by United States Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s friendly stance toward Bitcoin. During the summit, Cruz announced that he likes Bitcoin “because the government can’t control it,” further sharing that he makes weekly purchases of Bitcoin. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council and summit organizer, told Cointelegraph that Austin is home to several companies that promote self-custody for their customers. As such, Bratcher believes that the proportion of crypto holders with their assets on a hardware wallet or hot wallet is likely higher in Austin. “The number of people that are building great Bitcoin and digital asset companies in Austin insulates it a bit from the chaos in the centralized exchange ecosystem,” he remarked. Miami — one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs in the world — is also making strides. Specifically speaking, Miami remains the main attraction for NFT artists throughout the world. For example, Art Basel recently took place in Miami, showcasing a number of NFT artworks. While notable, spending behavior in Miami does appear to be impacted by the FTX collapse. Jumana Al Darwish, serial entrepreneur and Web3 investor, told Cointelegraph that while Art Basel Miami this year was a mixture of blue chip artists and emerging talent, galleries were playing it safe with the pieces that they had on display. She said:“With post-pandemic economic recovery in place and crypto winter being in full swing coupled with the latest FTX scandal, one could sense that visitors were more conservative versus the impulse buying behavior that had taken place in previous years.”This shouldn’t come as a surprise, though, as a recent report from the Financial Times has also suggested that Miami nightclubs have taken financial hits following the failure of FTX.It’s also interesting to point out that once-popular crypto cities like San Francisco have been gaining traction. Tegan Kline, co-founder and head of business at Edge and Node — a Web3 software development company — told Cointelegraph that Edge and Node recently opened a Web3 house in San Francisco to provide a coworking space for startups and entrepreneurs:“Some U.S. hubs like Austin and Miami have taken away from San Francisco, but the startup ethos of San Francisco will never die. It is one of the few places in the world where you can talk about your crazy startup idea at dinner and they don’t kick you out, but rather offer to help — be it by financing, looking for talent, etc.”In addition, regions like Singapore are reporting growth within the Web3 sector. Oliver Xie, founder and CEO of decentralized insurance platform InsurAce, told Cointelegraph that although Singapore’s crypto ecosystem has been affected by the FTX collapse, there is now a stronger focus on Web3. “Within the government, there are signs of a pivot away from crypto, the Deputy Prime Minister in a recent parliament hearing also said Singapore no longer seeks to become a global crypto trading hub, but rather will be focusing on real innovations with new Web3 technologies,” he said.Crypto hotspots face ongoing challengesWhile it’s notable that crypto-friendly cities continue to thrive despite recent events, there are still a number of challenges that may result in slow growth. For example, regulatory clarity is still very much needed in order for these ecosystems to advance. Yoav Tzucker, chief marketing officer at Collider Ventures, told Cointelegraph that regulation continues to be a pain point for the Israeli ecosystem. Although Israel’s chief economist recently developed a list of recommendations as to how policymakers should tackle digital asset laws, Tzucker still believes that regulation is lacking. “I think that this is the main barrier for Israeli founders in the Web3 ecosystem.”Even in regions such as Dubai — which has established laws on virtual asset regulation and has created authorities like the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) — regulatory clarity still needs to advance. Linda Adami, founder and CEO of Dubai-based Web3 platform, told Cointelegraph that while companies such as Binance and Kraken have received licenses in Dubai, more local companies need to be developed from the ground up. “Similarly to how Emirates Airlines established Dubai as a tourism and service hub, what will be the future Dubai-grown Web3 native success stories,” she said. Recent: Gensler’s approach toward crypto appears skewed as criticisms mountWhile crypto regulations remain a hot topic of debate within the U.S, Bratcher shared that emerging crypto cities like Austin still lack the capital flow seen in cities like New York and San Francisco: “Austin needs a continuation of the inflow of venture capitalists and capital from Silicon Valley in order to further establish itself as the epicenter for the Web3 digital asset ecosystem.”Although this may be the case, Klein noted that the growing amount of crime and homelessness in San Francisco may be driving talent elsewhere. Yet, she believes that Edge and Node’s Web3 house may serve as a solution to this problem, stating, “We have many events and initiatives happening at the Edge and Node House of Web3 regarding how we can use Web3 tools to work toward solutions to help heal San Francisco.”  ",2022-12-13

The 30-year-old Bankman-Fried arrived at a heavily guarded Bahamas court on Tuesday for his first in-person public appearance since the crypto currency exchange's collapse. He could be extradited to the United States. “Mr Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” his lawyer, Mark S Cohen, said in a statement. In the indictment, prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX's customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for expenses and debts and to make investments on behalf of his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC. He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing them with false and misleading information about the hedge fund's condition, and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said. Both the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged Bankman-Fried committed fraud in lawsuits filed on Tuesday. ""While he spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments, Bankman-Fried's house of cards began to crumble,"" the SEC filing said. The CFTC sued Bankman-Fried, Alameda, and FTX on Tuesday, alleging fraud involving digital commodity assets. Since at least May 2019, FTX raised more than US$1.8 billion from equity investors in a years-long ""brazen, multi-year scheme"" in which Bankman-Fried concealed that FTX was diverting customer funds to its affiliated crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC, the SEC alleged. While the public believed Bankman-Fried's ""lies"" and sent billions of dollars to FTX, he improperly diverted customer funds to his hedge fund, the SEC said in a court filing. He continued to divert FTX customer funds even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, the SEC said. Bankman-Fried has apologized to customers and acknowledged oversight failings at FTX, but said he doesn't personally think he has any criminal liability. Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 and rode a cryptocurrency boom to build it into one of the world's largest exchanges of the digital tokens. Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at US$26.5 billion, and he became a substantial donor to US political campaigns, media outlets and other causes. A crypto exchange is a platform on which investors can trade digital tokens such as bitcoin. Brad Simon, a criminal defence lawyer in New York, said he doubted Bankman-Fried would fight extradition, given his interviews about the case. Simon said he could be in the United States in a few weeks. Simon also said US authorities likely moved to prevent Bankman-Fried from testifying in Congress, which could be used by his defence attorneys to claim certain immunities and it often ""throws a monkey wrench in prosecutions"". CRYPTO INVESTORS LOST BILLIONS FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov 11, leaving an estimated 1 million customers and other investors facing losses in the billions of dollars. The collapse reverberated across the crypto world and sent bitcoin and other digital assets plummeting. A spokesperson for FTX Debtors declined to comment. Known in financial circles by his initials, SBF, Bankman-Fried was a prominent and unconventional figure. He sported wild hair, t-shirts and shorts on panel appearances with statesmen like former US President Bill Clinton and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Bankman-Fried became one of the largest Democratic donors in the United States, contributing US$5.2 million to President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. Police in the Bahamas, where FTX was based, said he was arrested on Monday evening at his luxury gated community called the Albany in the capital, Nassau. Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement on Monday evening the arrest came at the request of the US government. The Bahamas' attorney general's office said it expected him to be extradited to the United States. Bahamas Police said he was arrested due to ""various Financial Offences against laws of the United States, which are also offences"" in the Bahamas. It was not immediately clear what would take place at the hearing or whether Bankman-Fried would decide to fight extradition, potentially setting up a high-stakes battle. FTX's liquidity crunch came after Bankman-Fried secretly used US$10 billion in customer funds to support his proprietary trading firm, Alameda Research, Reuters has reported. At least US$1 billion in customer funds had vanished, the people said. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX's chief executive officer the same day as the bankruptcy filing. Unlike other customers, Alameda was allowed to hold a negative account on FTX's platform, the SEC said. Bankman-Fried directed code to be written that allowed this, the agency said.                    ",2022-12-13

They've been quantitatively tightening and that has had a really dramatic impact on crypto markets. While I think there's some really firm, fundamental underpinnings to the market, there had just been so much froth because that big macro driver had really captivated people's imaginations. We've seen the same are kind of similar dynamics in the tech stocks, but I don't I don't think technology is over. I don't think crypto is over as well."" FTX - Sam Bankman-Fried ""We never did any business with FTX. I think our approach to crypto has been pretty conservative. We took very large risks earlier on. We actually made very substantial profits from our early investments. We more or less tripled our money and exited almost all that risk and returned that capital to our investors. That was pretty exciting. That happened through 2021 but we took the opportunity to build out a range of institutional asset management products in this space."" ""When the FTX news hit, I told our team that I think this marks the beginning of the end of this bear market. I didn't mean that it would end on the day, but it's when big things like this big frauds happen. They happen. They don't happen at the highs they happen more or less in the range of the lows. Thankfully we didn't have any exposure. Our investors didn't have any exposure.""Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out. ""It's just not an area that's interesting to us when people make money faster than average or way faster than average. That's something to kind of steer clear of and so in the calls that I had, he seemed like a very nice, lovely person. But as I said we didn't do business with them. There are a lot of lovely, nice people in the world. And yeah, we just we didn't touch that."" ""We go through a very thorough due diligence process with all of our counterparties and FTX. wasn't a firm that passed our due diligence and so we didn't we didn't end up working with them."" Blockchain ""I think one of the things that's happened in this last cycle with Bitcoin and digital asset prices is that it was sufficiently large enough that it attracted a lot of attention. This resulted in a lot of people getting involved in too much leverage, and that's been painful on the unwind, but the silver lining is that it got big enough and real enough that it finally pushed institutions to start really investing in blockchain technology, which ultimately, we have a very high degree of confidence will provide a new infrastructure foundation for finance."" ""Over the 10-15 years, just about all trading will be done on blockchain. You'll have you'll have digital custodians, obviously, have got some terrific ones right now, Coinbase, being the leader. You'll have traditional finance enter that space through time. Stocks will be traded as tokens just as Bitcoin is. Bonds will be traded as tokens, commodities will likely be traded as tokens, funds, ETFs as well. Bitcoin will be one of the multitude of tokens that will trade. I think Bitcoin will retain its position as digital gold at a minimum, it could become something bigger than that. I see in that future world the price of Bitcoin and a number of these other assets will go up along way."" Inflation ""It is true that the Fed is trying to reduce inflation. It's highly unlikely that it gets anywhere down near to 2% sustainably. We're probably moving to an environment where inflation is between 3, 4 or 5%. Sometimes it goes a bit higher, sometimes it goes a little bit lower, but when you look at previous periods of higher inflation, they also have a lot of inflation volatility. So that's what we need to live through right now."" ""There are drivers in place that are going to keep inflation higher for longer and more volatile for longer. And I don't think whether Fed Funds go an extra 25 basis points up or down is not going to change that paradigm in the least."" ""We're going to see in the early part of the year inflation heading in the direction of the consensus, and that's going to make people feel pretty good about it. But we don't think that it will sustain those levels. We think we're going to end up with a materially higher inflation rate.""  Policy Choices ""We spent the last 30 years of my career in this world of ever deeper global integration. That process is at a minimum shifting. It may be that there's still plenty of globalization, but we're shifting from China more toward India and other trading partners or regional partners like Mexico and Canada, which already our biggest trading partners. But it's likely that there's going to be a lot of consolidation and in our key partners, it's likely that we're moving toward a more bipolar world as opposed to a unipolar world."" ""We think you're going to end up with is a world where there is a lot more reshoring. Economies throughout the world look to secure natural resources, they look for more redundant supplies of all the things that are critical to them. That's going to create really lower productivity, higher wages, and a different inflationary dynamic. We think that those things have only just begun, incidentally. I think part of that is just the policy choices that we're making, and that policy choice will narrow inequality. Hopefully, we're kind of lifting the lower income segment up.""

She said now is the time for lawmakers to ask questions to get to the bottom of what happened at FTX, especially what happened to the customer funds that were lost in the shuffle.Politicians could also think twice about taking donations from primarily crypto-based platforms, according to Smith.Read more: FTX US 'Was Not Independent' of Parent Company, New FTX CEO Will Say in House TestimonyWhether former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s political donations, which amounted to upwards of $73 million, can be clawed back to repay FTX creditors, is unlikely, according to Smith.“Once that money is donated, it’s usually fairly quickly spent,” Smith said, pointing out that in the weeks preceding the election, candidates spend a fairly large quantity of the money they’ve received on sending out mailers and buying airtime.“If it turns out the source of these funds were indeed customer deposits, that’s obviously a massive misuse,” said Smith. “It could be that the genie's out of the bottle and they won’t be able to get it back in.”",2022-12-13

However, amid the $40 billion Terra Luna implosion in May, Jun said that “old money has all but fled” after the incident.We chose to start @ABCDECapital at the most difficult time of the market.

One thought the feud between FTX and Binance would encourage healthy industry development, but it turned out FTX was so weak that it just straight-up surrendered, bringing a wave of catastrophe. Today Binance has over 75% market share, and whether he likes it or not, CZ’s [Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao] attitude towards regulation represents that of the entire industry, and it’s a huge challenge for CZ.”With regard to decentralized finance, or DeFi, Jun attributed that summer’s boom to quantitative easing (QE) measures of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Tying it to regulation, Jun said that DeFi growth took place largely due to companies such as Coinbase, Circle, Grayscale and Paxos “actively embraced regulation” and allowed large institutional investors to enter the space against the backdrop of QE:FTX’s implosion made traditional old money and government agencies afraid, or even disgusted, by the chaotic and orderless realm of crypto. For a long time thereafter, governments would not support relaxed policies that support development and innovation in crypto, nor would sovereign wealth funds invest in the market.”Jun also revealed that since ABCDE Capital began investing in August, the firm has since amassed seven companies in its portfolio in the security, data, social, zero knowledge, and nonfungible tokens sectors. “ABCDE only invests in 15-20 firms per year; a good firm is not afraid of the bear market, referrals are welcome, let's continue!” wrote the co-founder.

Bankman-Fried, who had been living in an expansive penthouse in the Bahamas, was arrested there on Monday evening.The US indictment detailing the charges follows weeks of speculation over the the 30-year-old’s fate after his company — once one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world — plunged into bankruptcy last month.He’ll be arraigned in the Bahamas on Tuesday and faces extradition to the US. “Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” Mark Cohen, his attorney said in a statement.The US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday alleged that FTX raised more than $1.8 billion, including $1.1 billion from about 90 US-based investors, in an “orchestrated scheme to defraud equity investors,” who bought in based on the belief that FTX had appropriate controls.Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged that Bankman-Fried took hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from Alameda Research, which he also founded, which were then used to buy real estate and make donations to politicians.Read more: The Charges Against Bankman-Fried Filed by SEC, DOJ, CFTCAccording to the SEC, Bankman-Fried misled investors, telling them that FTX had sophisticated risk controls and that their assets were secure. Instead, the regulator alleged in its complaint, he was using their money as a “virtually unlimited line of credit” for trading firm Alameda while concealed risks and obscuring FTX’s relationship with the trading firm.Story continuesMore than 100 FTX-related entities, including Alameda, filed for US bankruptcy protections on Nov. 11.Follow Live: FTX CEO John J Ray III Says Securing Assets to Take Weeks or Months: TOPLiveMedia InterviewsIn media interviews since FTX’s collapse, Bankman-Fried has admitted major managerial missteps, but has also claimed that he never tried to commit fraud or break the law.In draft remarks prepared for the US House hearing and obtained by Bloomberg News prior to his arrest, he offered a blunt assessment of his plight.“I would like to start by formally stating under oath: I f—-ked up,” Bankman-Fried wrote in the draft.He added that the company’s new managers, led by restructuring expert John J. Ray III, have repeatedly rebuffed his offers to help sift through the wreckage of the collapsed crypto empire. Ray hasn’t responded to five of his emails, he said. Ray is still scheduled to testify at the hearing on Tuesday.In remarks prepared for the House hearing, Ray blamed FTX’s collapse on the failures of its previous leaders.“The FTX Group’s collapse appears to stem from the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals,” Ray said in the written testimony released Monday in advance of the hearing. The prior management “failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people’s money or assets.”Crypto ExchangesPrior to the arrest and long before his empire collapsed into bankruptcy, federal prosecutors in Manhattan had already been looking into FTX as part of broader sweep of exchanges and potential anti-money laundering violations under the Bank Secrecy Act.The investigation, led by the Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit, took a different trajectory after FTX’s catastrophic implosion.Prosecutors were closely examining whether hundreds of millions of dollars were improperly transferred to the Bahamas around the time of FTX’s Nov. 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware, according to a person familiar with the matter.They were also digging into whether FTX broke the law by transferring funds to Alameda Research, the bankrupt investment firm also founded by Bankman-Fried, Bloomberg reported previously.Last week, prosecutors, the FBI, Department of Justice officials and FTX’s new CEO and restructuring expert Ray met at SDNY’s headquarters in downtown Manhattan.

The U.S. government's request for his arrest, based on a sealed indictment filed by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, came a day before Bankman-Fried was due to appear before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to answer questions about the collapse of the major cryptocurrency exchange he formerly ran as CEO.      Key Takeaways  Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday by local police in the Bahamas after a request to do so from the U.S. government.Bankman-Fried is being charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering.Bankman-Fried is expected to be extradited soon to the U.S. to face criminal charges in what will be a closely examined case.      Bankman-Fried Charged With Fraud, Money Laundering, and Conspiracy    The Royal Bahamas Police Force arrested Bankman-Fried, according to a statement released on Monday. The former FTX CEO will be extradited from the Bahamas after U.S. officials make the request. What happens next in his case could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry.    The New York Times reported the specific charges against Bankman-Fried to be wire fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has authorized separate charges against the former FTX CEO. All are criminal charges that carry heavy penalties, and Bankman-Fried’s case will receive intense scrutiny.    The attorney general of the Bahamas, Ryan Pinder, also released a statement on the arrest, saying that a U.S. extradition request would be answered promptly. Meanwhile, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said that his country would continue its own investigation of FTX, which was incorporated in the Bahamas. Bankman-Fried will appear in a Bahamian court on Tuesday.    Authorities in the Bahamas are not without their own share of controversy. U.S. lawyers made the claim that officials there had asked Bankman-Fried to gain access to systems and help the country mint a new cryptocurrency.      Bankman-Fried Arrest's Fallout for Industry    Bankman-Fried’s arrest comes at a dramatic moment, as he also was set to appear before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee this week. Only hours before his hearing, the Senate committee said that Bankman-Fried refused to appear and would not accept the service of a subpoena. The committee called this “an unprecedented abdication of accountability.”    The arrest could mark a major turn of events for the crypto market and certainly for Bankman-Fried, once the poster boy of the industry. Former federal prosecutors have stated that there could be significant jail time in store for Bankman-Fried, totaling many years. Bankman-Fried faces several civil charges as well from angry customers who have lost money in the $8 billion case.    The SEC also has commented on the matter, and has authorized separate charges of securities law violations.      Crypto Community Celebrates Arrest    Several members of the crypto community, and some outside it, commented on Twitter Tuesday about the high-profile arrest of Bankman-Fried. Eight founder and CEO Michaël van de Poppe perhaps facetiously suggested that the market would skyrocket, while the crypto community in general joked about the arrest.    Peter Schiff, a prominent crypto skeptic, also offered his opinion on the arrest. He said he wasn’t sure why the government authorized the arrest before Bankman-Fried appeared before Congress. Bitinning founder Kashif Raza said the same, wondering why the arrest was made before the hearings. Others pointed out that the arrest comes at an odd time, after Bankman-Fried allegedly made donations to Democratic politicians.      The Bottom Line    Bankman-Fried’s arrest may be the most dramatic event yet in the FTX case. It may portend the beginning of the end in the FTX exchange saga, but the collapse continues to have effects on the crypto market. For example, Bitcoin is hovering around $17,000 and may face some rough months ahead as the FTX prosecution unfolds.  ",2022-12-13

With peer in the space FTX (FTT-USD) seeing its main token crash eventually resulting in FTX filing for bankruptcy, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other coins saw their prices drop considerably. While one might expect that bears might have taken a victory lap and cashed in their profits when it came to Coinbase, recent data shows that the naysayers are still looking for more downside. I covered the initial surge for short interest in Coinbase back in late June, as in just a month and half the number of shares short had surged from 9.5 million to over 31.4 million. 2022 started at just over 3.5 million shares short, but one might have expected to see some rise in short interest as the share price started to fall. Well, as we get ready to finish out the year, a new wave of bears joined the party, as the chart below shows the end of November update. Coinbase Shares Short (NASDAQ)At the end of last month, a little under 37.5 million shares were short, which itself is a new high, and is up about 969% for the year. Even though the stock's float has risen in the low double digits percentage wise since late June, the percentage of float short has ticked up a couple of percentage points to over 25.3%. According to finviz data, of the 832 stocks with a market cap of at least $9 billion at the end of last week, Coinbase was in the top 10 names in terms of percentage of float short. The interesting part here is that the dollar value of shares short hasn't changed that much in the last month. At the end of October, that figure was $1.745 billion, but it was only down to $1.714 billion at the end of November. That's despite a more than $20 decline in the stock, which if short interest had remained constant, would have meant a large drop in the dollar value of short bets. As a point of reference, there's about $80 million more being bet against the stock now than at my June update on short interest, which tells you that investors are still looking for more downside despite the name being close to new lows at the end of last month. The drama at FTX certainly added a new chapter to the cryptocurrency story. Earlier this year, Coinbase revenue estimates were coming down as many coins dropped in price. This was because investors were trading less and were holding less assets on the platform. At that point, there was still a lot of faith in the crypto story overall, but recent events have shaken that confidence quite a bit. It will be interesting to see how Coinbase's asset base finishes the year, and to see how much trading volumes fell after the FTX fiasco. In the table below, I've detailed how Coinbase revenue estimates have dropped since late June.   Coinbase Revenue Estimates (Seeking Alpha)As we were set to finish Q2 this year, analysts thought that Q4 would be the last quarter to see revenues lower than they were in the prior year period. Now, analysts think we'll see revenue declines through the first half of 2023. These Street averages may still have room to go down, as some of the high estimates seem pretty optimistic currently. That might just be a case of a certain analyst not yet updating their numbers, especially when it comes to the back half of next year. In my previous article, I thought that new lows for Coinbase shares were possible, and we have definitely gotten to that point. Shares fell below $40 for the first time on Monday before rebounding a little. Still, I've kept talking about the street remaining quite positive, as the average price target is still over $72 a share. Of course, that average is down about $20 since the company's Q3 report, and well off its spring 2021 all-time high of more than $500. This is certainly one of the names this year where analysts have been quite late, only cutting their targets after the stock takes another leg down. With revenues dropping a bit in recent quarters, Coinbase has started to rack up some large net losses. This has resulted in quite a bit of cash burn, which has weakened the balance sheet. At the end of last year, the company had over $7.1 billion of cash, or more than $3.7 billion when excluding debt. When the September quarter came to a close, the cash balance was down to just $5 billion, or about $1.6 billion net of debt. A few more bad quarters like this could easily result in a capital raise to bring in some fresh funds to solidify the financial situation here.  In the end, Coinbase shares have fallen to lows, and short sellers as a whole are not exactly rushing to take large profits just yet. At the end of November, the number of shares short was at a new high for the stock, with the dollar value of these negative bets being close to its peak as well. With the FTX collapse hurting the entire crypto space, Coinbase revenue estimates are dropping considerably, and a capital raise might be needed if large losses and cash burn continue.",2022-12-13

FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following a liquidity crisis caused by Bankman-Fried's mismanagement of about $10 billion in customer funds. ""The FTX group's collapse appears to stem from absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company entrusted with other people's money or assets,"" Ray said.   His opening statements stuck fairly close to his written testimony, which was provided to the committee beforehand.  FTX LIVE UPDATES: FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED INDICTED IN NEW YORK, ARRESTED IN BAHAMAS     John Ray, chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during a House Financial Services Committee hearing investigating the collapse of FTX in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2022. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)Ray – who took over following Bankman-Fried's resignation and has handled several major corporate collapses, including Enron – said in his written testimony that nearly all the cases he has handled alleging criminal activity ""share common characteristics,"" but ""never in my career have I seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever.""The new FTX CEO said his investigation is still ongoing but has found several ""unacceptable management practices"" so far that exposed customers to significant losses. The seasoned restructuring officer revealed that senior FTX management had access to customer assets they were able to redirect, held hundreds of millions of dollars of crypto access absent of security controls or encryption, and that Alameda was able to borrow funds from FTX for its own trading and investments ""without any effective limits whatsoever."" ""The fundamental challenge we face is we're, in many respects, starting from near zero in terms of the corporate infrastructure and record-keeping that one would expect in a multibillion-dollar corporation,"" Ray told lawmakers. EX-CRYPTO BOSS SAM BANKMAN-FRIED SLAMMED FOR COMMITTING ‘PURE AND SIMPLE, GOOD OLD-FASHIONED FRAUD’      Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder and chief executive officer of FTX, in Hong Kong, China, on May 11, 2021. (Lam Yik/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)Still, the investigation into what happened remains in a ""very preliminary stage,"" Ray said, and it could be a significant period of time until the full extent of what happened is known. What is known, according to Ray's testimony, is that FTX was gambling with customer assets by commingling them with Alameda's and engaging in margin trading.Further, Ray revealed, the FTX group went on what he called ""a spending binge"" in late 2021 through this year shelling out roughly $5 billion on an array of businesses and investments that ""may be worth only a fraction of what was paid for them."" He also wrote that ""loans and other payments were made to insiders in excess of $1 billion.""He also informed lawmakers that his ability to answer their questions would be limited by FTX's poor record-keeping and ongoing law enforcement investigations.FEDERAL PROSECUTORS CHARGE FTX FOUNDER BANKMAN-FRIED WITH 8 COUNTS OF CONSPIRACY, FRAUDWATCH: FTX CEO blames 'grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals' for collapse close      video FTX CEO blames 'grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals' for collapse FTX CEO John Ray testified Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, blaming ""grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals"" like founder Sam Bankman-Fried.Legislators fumed at the revelations from Ray's testimony. Committee Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., slammed FTX's ""total disregard"" for customers, saying she was ""deeply troubled to learn how common it was for Bankman-Fried and FTX employees to steal from the cookie jar of customer funds to finance their lavish lifestyles."" Ranking member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., praised Ray as a ""reliable witness,"" in contrast to Bankman-Fried, whose media interviews and tweets since FTX's collapse he said ""are no substitute for the facts."" ""Bankman-Fried is nothing new,"" McHenry said, naming him among America's greatest financial fraudsters. ""It appears to be the same old school fraud, just using new technology."" SENATORS SLAM BANKMAN-FRIED FOR REFUSING TO TESTIFY BEFORE BANKING PANEL ON FTX COLLAPSE     Rep.

He faces charges from federal prosecutors in New York and another fraud complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The SEC complaint, filed Tuesday, accuses Bankman-Fried of carrying out ""a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX Trading Ltd,"" his cryptocurrency trading platform. The court filing describes the alleged operation as ""a massive, years-long fraud.""Bankman-Fried has also been indicted by New York prosecutors on eight counts of conspiracy and fraud.Waters said she hoped Bankman-Fried's arrest ""means he will be held accountable for the fraud he has committed and the harm he has caused."" FOX Business' Breck Dumas and Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report. ",2022-12-13

From a tech business point of view, we’ve seen huge mergers, some of which aren’t yet complete, like Microsoft buying games developer Activision ($108 billion) and chipmaker Broadcom dropping a cool $95.5b on virtualisation company VMware. Vast amounts of money, like Elon Musk buying Twitter for almost $70b, only to turn it into a far right hellscape that’s driving users and advertisers to quit.With interest rates spiking and both consumers and businesses curtailing spending, it would be amazing if there are more such exuberant billion-dollar deals next year. Fire sales seem more likely, possibly even for well-known tech brands.If the market works as imagined, the upside of the above should be that everything gets cheaper. Oh, wait. Subscription prices are going up steeply as rising inflation means Big Tech has to raise prices to keep shareholders happy.That said, hardware should become less expensive as Covid-induced chip and component shortages that plagued just about every industry sector this year ease while demand tapers off.Next year would in theory be a great time to grab some bargain tech deals, except any spare cash users might have will go towards rising mortgages and inflated grocery prices instead.Most of that tech is still made in China, but for how long? See, China has shot itself in the foot with overly aggressive assertive politics, while others have accused the country of human rights abuses.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.So much so that the United States now provides massive subsidies to bring manufacturing back to its shores.This includes giant chip-making factories. The US knows it can ill afford to lose its pole position in tech, and started wincing when rumours popped up that China would invade Taiwan to gain control over TSMC, the world’s largest chip maker.Furthermore, existing electronics manufacturing in China has become strife-torn. Workers at Foxconn - which makes pricey iPhone Pros for Apple - have been rioting because of working conditions and Covid restrictions. Such unrest could spread.Apple is looking at supply chain diversification as a result. Watch this space. That trend will accelerate next year.It won’t speed to New Zealand however. Everything’s too expensive here, and we don’t have basic transport infrastructure like developed train networks.While we could tempt Big Tech with renewable energy, which is very important to have on corporate balance sheets, and political stability, there aren’t enough skilled engineers and workers here. Manufacturing in NZ was put to sleep decades ago unfortunately.We will have data centres galore though, mainly in Auckland. US names like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and local outfits like Datacom, CCL and Datagrid are just a few companies setting up in New Zealand. You’ll need to learn to use HyperScalers instead of data centre operators in 2023.Will our renewable electricity generation be sufficient to power a slew of giant data centres? We’re about to find out. Let’s hope the power supply will be robust enough so that the armada of smoky and noisy diesel back-up generators for the data centres won’t have to fire up very often.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Building new dams for the big additional water supplies required by data centres probably isn’t a silly idea for next year either.At the user infrastructure end of things, the UltraFast Broadband network rollout is coming to an end with the final bit going live in Opononi. We shouldn’t stop there though and continue to get UFB-equivalent broadband to as many of the approximately 835,000 people and 600,000 rural businesses that are underserved currently.We did it with electricity supply and the copper phone network. Leaving the broadband supply to overseas low earth orbit satellite companies incorporated in tax havens instead of with local providers is just wrong on multiple levels.At the rate cryptocurrency exchanges are failing, with billions and billions of real and virtual money vanishing, 2023 could be the year when blockchain, Bitcoin and whatever become unfashionable. Especially so with commentators who think a slow, inefficient and poorly scalable database is the magic solution to every software issue on the planet.Speaking of software, artificial intelligence (AI), the algorithmically jazzed-up regular expressions with statistical analysis, will be on everyone’s lips next year, with an increasing number of data centres providing the enormous amount of computing power to sift through an endless amount of information collated from the internet.AI couldn’t have happened without the runaway social experiment that is the internet, in other words. Asking OpenAI’s ChatGPT where it’ll all end didn’t work, however, as the site has become so popular and overloaded that it is now unusable.Will next year see a solution to the collision between stronger security for everyone and the demands from politicians, police and signals intelligence spooks to be able to eavesdrop on communications?Probably not. You have to feel for even Big Tech in that respect. On the one hand, they’ll be prosecuted if they don’t provide safety with strong end-to-end encryption for users, as data breaches and privacy law violation penalties become the norm. If they beef up security, governments will go after them because of interception laws and national security requirements. In either case, being a somewhat tech-savvy lawyer is a hot career tip for 2023.It’s an exciting year ahead, and no correspondence will be entered into over the entirely accurate predictions above.SaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail",2022-12-13

The year has been marked by several highly volatile events like the Terra USD (UST) collapse, the 3AC bankruptcy and the subsequent domino effect on other lenders, and the latest FTX debacle that has also brought fresh contagion with it. In this final month of December, however, the short-term volatility seems to have taken a plunge to cycle lows as the asset’s price has mostly been trading sideways. Now, the 1-week annualized realized volatility is just 22%, while the 2-week version is down to only 28%. The last time Bitcoin observed such low values in these metrics was back in October 2020, before this cycle’s bull run began.                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc575326 = window.plc575326 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc575326:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_575326_' + plc575326;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 575326,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_575326_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc575326++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  Related Reading:  XRP Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $33 Million From Binance  Looks like the value of the crypto has seen a sharp surge during the past 24 hours | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $17.4k, up 2% in the last week.

The US lawmaker, who has also been referred to as Washington’s “Crypto Queen,” previously disclosed that she held between $100,000 to $350,000 worth of crypto tokens.  Senator Lummis defends Bitcoins in retirement funds In an interview with Semafor on 12 December, Senator Lummis came out swinging in favor of US citizens who wished to hold Bitcoin [BTC] in their 401k retirement plans. While talking about the largest cryptocurrency, she said, “I’m very comfortable with making sure that people can include Bitcoin in their retirement funds because it’s just different than other cryptocurrencies.”  Cynthia Lummis was featured in an interview by CNBC, along with fellow Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. The lawmakers indicated that American investors should feel comfortable, including Bitcoin [BTC] in their retirement funds.  The trouble with Bitcoin in 401ks Earlier this year in April, investment giant Fidelity announced its plans to let investors add Bitcoins to their 401k retirement accounts. A 401k is a retirement savings plan offered by many American employers which holds annual contributions. This was a major move, given that Fidelity catered to 23,000 companies as their retirement plan provider.       Lawmakers in the US were divided over this decision. The country’s Department of Labor expressed concerns given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. This was followed by a letter penned by Senators Richard Durbin, Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith, to Fidelity Investments. This letter urged Fidelity to reconsider their decision to expose US citizens’ retirement savings to Bitcoin, given the downturn of the crypto market.  Senator Lummis not worried about Bitcoin However, Cynthia Lummis admitted that she was confident in Bitcoin’s value, given that only 21 million tokens will ever exist. As for the crypto winter, the Senator told Semafor that her support for BTC remained undeterred. Furthermore, at the time of writing, she had a bipartisan bill in the pipeline, which would reportedly treat cryptos as commodities. The bill would reportedly be introduced in January 2023.         Share                                     Share     Tweet                                ",2022-12-13

On Saturday, Russia took out energy facilities in Odesa, and Ukrainian officials said the strikes left over 1.5 million people without electricity.      The US has been trying to rally its allies to give Ukraine more aid to help repair its energy infrastructure but has raised nothing near what Shmyhal is asking for. Even if Ukraine did acquire the $1 billion, it would likely still take months to repair the power grid, and Russian strikes will likely persist as Ukraine is increasing attacks inside Russian territory. Russia didn’t start launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure until after the truck bombing of the Crimean bridge in October. Last week, drone attacks hit several air bases inside Russian territory, including targets hundreds of miles away from the Ukrainian border. The Russian strikes have left Ukrainian civilians in a dire situation, as many are without power and heat amid freezing temperatures, and there’s no relief in sight as there’s little hope for peace talks. Ukrainian officials maintain their conditions for talks are for Russia to withdraw from the territory it has captured, which is a non-starter for Moscow. The US and NATO continue to pledge support for Ukraine for “as long as it takes,” and the Pentagon reportedly now supports Ukrainian attacks inside Russia, which will lead to further escalation.

""The FTX group's collapse appears to stem from absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced, non-sophisticated individuals,"" said John Ray, who was named CEO of FTX after Bankman-Fried stepped down and the company filed for bankruptcy on Nov 11. Ray also said there was virtually no distinction between the operations of FTX and Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's crypto trading firm, which maintained close ties with his exchange. ""I've just never seen an utter lack of record keeping - absolutely no internal controls whatsoever,"" Ray told the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. A representative for Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ray's testimony. He said he was shocked to learn FTX was using Quickbooks - software geared toward small and mid-size businesses - for accounting and approving invoices via Slack messages. Asked why he had testified that he did not believe the audited financial statements were reliable, Ray said: ""We've lost 8 billion dollars of customer money. So by definition, I don't trust a single piece of paper in this organisation."" It will take weeks, perhaps months, to secure all the group's assets, Ray said, warning it would be a lengthy process. ""At the end of the day, we're not going to be able to recover all the losses here,"" he said. ""OLD-FASHIONED EMBEZZLEMENT"" Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday evening in the Bahamas and appeared before a magistrate Tuesday. US federal prosecutors on Tuesday alleged he committed fraud and violated campaign finance laws. The former CEO of the exchange also faces additional charges by US regulators. The Bahamas attorney general's office said it expects Bankman-Fried will be extradited to the United States. During Tuesday's hearing, Bankman-Fried indicated to a magistrate judge in the Bahamas that he would fight extradition, according to a Reuters witness. Ray said FTX would cooperate in turning over information to authorities and that he had already shared some findings of his internal investigation into the collapse of the company with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors. Since he took over as CEO, Ray said he has established that customer assets at FTX were commingled with those of Alameda Research. Client funds were used to engage in margin trading, which exposed customers to massive losses, he said, calling the practice ""old-fashioned embezzlement."" Ray said in his testimony that he had hired a new chief financial officer, a head of human resources and administration, and a head of information technology. He has also appointed a board of directors, which is chaired by former judge Joseph Farnan. He also told lawmakers on Tuesday that FTX will look to sell its crypto derivatives exchange LedgerX, which is regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and was not included in the bankruptcy proceedings. Bankman-Fried had also been scheduled to appear before the committee on Tuesday, and his testimony had been highly anticipated. ""Unfortunately, the timing of his arrest denies the public the opportunity to get the answers they deserve,"" said the panel's chair, Democratic US Representative Maxine Waters. ""Rest assured that this committee will not stop until we uncover the full truth behind the collapse of FTX just a few months ago."" Representative Patrick McHenry, ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, described ""old-school fraud"" behind the fancy trappings of cryptocurrency trading at FTX. ""Fraud and fraudsters have been around just as long as that phrase has been around,"" he said. ""It appears to be the same old-school fraud - just using new technology.""

Binance token flow and balance chart. Source: Nansen. The net outflows impacted Ethereum (ETH) and other ERC20 tokens on the platform. Notably, net outflows refer to the difference between the value of cryptocurrencies arriving and leaving the exchange. Concerns over Binance reserves  Indeed, the high value of withdrawals comes at a period investors are still concerned with the state of their holdings on cryptocurrency exchanges, just a few weeks after the FTX collapse. Indeed, the situation pushed the exchanges to publish their proof of reserves to win investor confidence.

However, the document has come under scrutiny, with analysts pointing out that the reserves are of a narrow scope. The uncertainty accelerated after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced the exchange was temporarily halting the withdrawals of USD Coin (USDC), citing a token swap issue.  “On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals. However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD. The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open,” Zhao said.   Crypto investors have been on edge following the FTX collapse and the subsequent arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Fears have been rife that the fallout from FTX might spread to the rest of the market partly contributing to the withdrawals.  Binance criminal investigations  Besides concerns about Binance’s reserves, the withdrawals have coincided with reports of a possible criminal prosecution of Binance by United States regulators. As reported by Finbold, the Department of Justice is split on whether to charge Binance for unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations. If the charges are to be formalized, Binance executives, including Zhao, are likely to face legal action in the U.S.  The development saw Binance native token BNB momentarily slump.

One of the indicators of XRP’s future price is the activity of its whales, who took advantage of the token’s recent price retracement to increase their holdings, suggesting that they could be expecting the price to increase in the near future, per a report by the crypto analytics platform Santiment published on December 13. In addition, the report included a chart demonstrating the growth in whale activity as compared with the XRP price action. According to the chart, the supply held by whale holders (holding between 100,000 and 10 million XRP) grew from 16.7% to 18.29% in five weeks as of December 11. XRP price versus transactions between 100,000 and 10 million. Source: Santiment Indeed, observing that a significant price surge of the Ripple-issued decentralized finance (DeFi) asset against the rest of the markets in late September and early October was followed by a retracement, the report stated that:             Stocks    Here’s how much Bud Light stock is down in the last month                  Cryptocurrency    How much will Solana be worth in 2025?

It wouldn’t be terribly surprising for XRP to have another run in it, considering the increase in these whale addresses’ supply held went from 16.7% to 18.3% in 5 weeks.”  XRP price analysis Meanwhile, XRP is currently recording price gains on its daily, weekly, and monthly charts, as it is trading at the price of $0.3911, increasing 4.09% on the day, 0.55% compared to the week before, and 11.40% across the previous 30 days.

Presumably, the price of XRP could also be affected by the results of the court case that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is fighting against the XRP issuer Ripple, which is rumored to be ready by December 15.

As a result, users will now be able to send funds from the UK and Europe to select African countries. The application, Send Globally, will use the Bitcoin Lightning Network to send funds in fiat currencies. Under the application, users can send funds in British Pounds (GBP) or Euros (EUR) to the countries of Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana, where they will be converted into the local currencies of Nigerian Naira (NGN), Kenyan Shilling (KES), and Ghanaian Cedi (GHS). The Lightning Network will automatically convert the funds from GBP or EUR to BTC. They are then converted to the local currency of the African country and directly deposited into the recipient's bank account or online wallet.  This development bodes well for the crypto industry, struggling in 2022, with crypto prices taking a plunge amidst several firms going bankrupt. Before this initiative, users wishing to send funds across continents only had the option of a third-party, centralized facilitator like Western Union. The issues associated with centralized money exchanges include longer transaction times and higher transaction fees. Considering that the high remittances sent from European countries to sub-Saharan Africa are $40 billion, the transaction fees alone would amount to millions of dollars.  CoinCorner CEO Danny Scott acknowledged the scope of the remittance market and the role BTC can play in it.  He pointed out,   “The remittance market is a huge opportunity for Bitcoin. By partnering with Bitnob to provide a seamless cross-border experience using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, we hope to remove some of the friction and cost that customers experience when using traditional FX and money remittance companies.”  Sub-Saharan Remittance Corridor There has been a spur of crypto adoption in the MENA (Middle East and Africa) region, despite the efforts of the IMF to discourage the industry. With the introduction of the Lightning Network, Africans working in the UK and Europe can send funds home without worrying about extended processing times or high percentage cuts.  Bitnob CEO Bernad Parah believes the initiative will significantly reduce the costs of sending funds to the sub-Saharan region.  He stated,   “For us at Bitnob, this is another leap forward in economic empowerment for Africans. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most expensive region to send money to, where sending $200 costs an average of 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 according to the World Bank. Bitcoin is powering the future of money and this partnership highlights a strong use case of what the future will look like.”  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

That spike, according to CoinDesk, comes amid possible red flags revealed in its recent proof-of-reserve report.          But Binance announced on Twitter early this morning that the exchange is simply conducting a token swap with the USDC stablecoin, hence the decision to pause user withdrawals. A token swap, per ByBit, “involves the exchange of token types between two parties, from one blockchain to another.” The USDC is called a stablecoin since it’s value is 1 to 1 with the U.S. dollar.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao elaborated in a tweet that as Binance saw heightened user withdrawals of USDC on Sunday and in the early hours of Monday morning, the exchange made the decision to pause withdrawals as the banks that could honour them were closed. Reuters, citing data firm Nansen, reported that these withdrawals of USDC totaled $US1.9 ($3) billion. Zhao also encouraged users to withdraw other stable coins, like BUSD.   On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals. However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD. The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open. 1/2 — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 2022  “These are 1:1 conversions, no margin or leverage involved. We will also try to establish more fluid swap channels in the future. In the meantime, feel free to withdraw any other stable coin, BUSD, USDT, etc,” Zhao added in a follow-up. While an exchange pausing withdrawals is not inherently a bad thing, exchanges that have made that decision in the past have not fared well. Crypto exchange Celsius paused withdrawals for its 1.7 million users this past June, before filing for bankruptcy the following month. Binance, on the other hand, paused withdrawals around the same time as Celsius, but only temporarily as the value of Bitcoin fell while claiming in a tweet that the pause was “due to a stuck transaction causing a backlog.”  Binance’s current withdrawal pause comes as investors are already skittish as fellow cryptocurrency exchange FTX faces ongoing fallout.

The Bahamas government said in a statement that “S.B.F.’s arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against S.B.F. and is likely to request his extradition.”  Bahamian Police said Bankman-Fried was arrested shortly after 6 p.m. at his apartment complex in the Albany resort. The arrest was based on a sealed indictment filed by the Southern District of New York (SDNY). Bankman-Fried, who refused to appear before the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, has been charged with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering.

Argo is Close to Restructuring but has no Assurance of Avoiding BankruptcyGlobal leading crypto miner Argo Blockchain has announced it is close to restructuring as it enters advanced negotiations, but there is no reassurance it will avoid bankruptcy. According to Argo, the company is now preparing to sell some of its assets and carry out an equipment financing transaction to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its liquidity. Argo said it is at risk of having insufficient cash to support ongoing business operations within the next month. The funds from its sale will serve as respite for the troubled crypto miner. Argo hopes it can complete the restructuring without filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The crypto miner, which had its stocks suspended in the U.S. and U.K after news of bankruptcy broke last week, is requesting a relisting. Flipsider:Argo has been trying to raise between $25 million and $35 million since late August, but a $27 million deal fell through in October.

There was a reported increase in withdrawals, which could indicate that this prompted some users to panic.  Because of this, the value of its native cryptocurrency, BNB, may have dropped. Do Binance and BNB have more to their narrative than meets the eye, or is this just Fear Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)?  Read Binance Coin’s [BNB] price prediction 2023-2024  On 12 December, Reuters released a report that set off the chain of events. Key Binance executives were allegedly on the edge of US prosecution, according to the news agency’s report.       The report claimed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had been targeting Binance, the largest centralized bitcoin exchange, for years. Differing opinions among DOJ investigators were, however, holding up a full-scale arrest and prosecution.  A key point of contention, according to the report, was the weight of the accumulated evidence. Panic withdrawal or normal activity? Users of Binance apparently got into a state of fear once the information was released, as a massive withdrawal was observed once the report was released. Data from Nansen showed that over the course of 24 hours, Binance saw a negative net flow of billions of dollars.  Even if this change wasn’t directly related to the news, the timing of the huge outflow contributed to the FUD that prompted the withdrawals. The continual criticism the exchange received due to the audit and Proof-of-Reserve also didn’t help this narrative. Source: Nansen Andrew Thurman, an analyst, tweeted that couple of market makers had made substantial withdrawals during the previous days. Blockchain records revealed that significant amounts have been transferred away from Binance by a number of users over the past week, including major cryptocurrency market makers such as Jump Trading and Wintermute.  In terms of withdrawals from Binance, Jump Trading seems to stand out as a clear frontrunner. Constant activity off-exchange may indicate a dearth of liquidity.  Jump has net outflows from Binance in excess of $146 million on the week, and no inflows If Binance books look like they're completely drained of all liquidity, the exit of possibly the largest MM is probably a good reason why Source: https://t.co/aasol67vsX https://t.co/GbeXfXqwce pic.twitter.com/yLYXgBEsSW — Andrew T (@Blockanalia) December 12, 2022  BNB Drops in Daily Timeframe The native token of the exchange, BNB took notice of the happenings and reacted in a similar fashion. The asset’s price movement was horizontal up until 11 December, as could be seen in the daily timeframe chart, when it started to decline.  It had lost more than 4% of its value, and during the trading time that was being observed when this was being written, it had lost another 3%. Source: TradingView It is possible for a further downturn to occur because of the Relative Strength Index’s (RSI) stance, which was below the neutral line. Furthermore, the volume indicator’s indication showed that sellers were in control. Being an exchange token, holders may be recalling the demise of FTT when FTX went bankrupt. FUD or More? Coming Days will Tell… Twitter account lookonchain reported that Wintermute had deposited nearly $150 million and that Justin Sun had put $100 million into Binance within the past 24 hours. This action could quell the lingering FUD or be interpreted more broadly by critics.  Binance also posted a rebuttal to the Reuters news report in an attempt to clarify its position.         Share                                     Share     Tweet                                ",2022-12-13

With long-standing support from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and a high November trading price of $37 just before the crisis, SOL found itself the focus of intense selling pressure. However, since the crash, the DeFi asset has managed to maintain a floor price above $12, and it is still the fifteenth largest cryptocurrency by market value. Additionally, it continues to rival Ethereum in NFT transactions since investors are still interested in SOL. Interestingly, despite Solana’s 5% price gain as of December 13, the machine learning-based algorithms at PricePredictions, which factor in indicators like moving average (MA), relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BB), and others, suggest that SOL’s value will decrease by the end of the month.

So far, the company has recovered over $1 billion in assets and plans to sell LedgerX and other FTX companies. The entire process has been “unprecedented.” Related Reading: How Bankman-Fried Wanted To Attack Binance And Others In Today’s Hearing The current FTX CEO clarified that his priority is to recover assets and mitigate losses for FTX customers.

Scrutiny of how crypto exchanges such as Binance and its now-bankrupt former rival FTX handle customer deposits is under close scrutiny from users and regulators. FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with defrauding investors. Binance, whose dominance of crypto was cemented by the fall of FTX, last week tweeted a so-called proof-of-reserves report by audit firm Mazars. The report showed its holdings of bitcoin exceeded customer deposits on a single day in November. The $1.9 billion of token withdrawals based on the ethereum blockchain mark the largest daily outflow over a 24-hour period since June 13, the Nansen data showed, and accounted for the majority of the funds being pulled in the last seven days. “Binance’s withdrawals are increasing due to the growing uncertainty about its reserves report,” a Nansen spokesperson said.    Sam Bankman-Fried’s downfall and FTX’s implosion has left Binance as the world’s biggest crypto exchange.TNS The withdrawals were “business as usual,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted Tuesday. “We saw some withdrawals today (net $1.14b ish). We have seen this before. Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits.”        see also             Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao ripped Sam Bankman-Fried in texts as FTX fell       A Binance spokesperson earlier said it always had “more than enough funds” to meet withdrawal requests.  “User assets at Binance are all backed 1:1 and Binance’s capital structure is debt free,” the person said. Asked whether Binance had enough USDC to meet USDC withdrawal requests, the person added it may need to move funds to online “hot” digital wallets from offline wallets, convert stablecoins from one another or carry out network upgrades, sometimes causing delays. Binance said in a tweet around Tuesday afternoon that USDC withdrawals had resumed. Crypto news outlet CoinDesk reported earlier that Binance saw outflows of $902 million on Monday. Binance is already under pressure from authorities. Splits between U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a long-running criminal investigation focused on Binance’s compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, Reuters reported on Monday. The report sparked a drop of almost 4% in Binance’s BNB token, traders told Reuters. ‘TOKEN SWAP’ The Nansen data came as Binance halted withdrawals of USDC, citing a “token swap” — where digital token holders exchange their crypto coins, typically over different blockchains.    Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao downplayed the withdrawal of $1.9 billion in crypto currency in just 24 hours as “business as usual.” REUTERS “On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals,” Zhao tweeted early Tuesday. Binance said in September it would automatically convert user balances and new deposits of USD Coin and two other stablecoins into its own stablecoin, Binance USD.  Zhao said on Tuesday swapping USDC with two other tokens — Paxos Standard and Binance USD — requires using traditional dollars at a bank in New York.  USDC, issued by U.S.-based firm Circle, is the world’s second-biggest stablecoin. Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer and head of global policy, said that there will be “challenges” relating to liquidity and redemptions when assets are swapped in the way Binance has done with USDC. “The feature of liquid dollar digital currencies should be that they are redeemable on demand, and at par at all times, even during conditions of stress,” Disparte added.

These funds reportedly contained a number of large undisclosed financial ties, including ""venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations."" The filing went on to say that SBF ""used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses.""He allegedly continued misusing funds even as the company sankFTX began to see the writing on the wall in May, when the crypto market began to collapse and the exchange was unable to pay back practically anybody.

That is the main point why I would not recommend buying it as a long-term investment. Although it is an interesting speculative instrument, I believe its real value is zero and it is therefore not worth buying for conservative investors. It can go up tenfold but then fall down to Earth. If you are considering buying BTC at a discount thanks to a massive correction, I would not personally recommend it. But let me explain my thesis in some more detail. Bitcoin as an investment - difference from other asset classes You might argue, indeed, that Bitcoin is not different from other asset classes. After all, everyone is buying BTC, even conservative pension funds do. The worse it is for them since they risk their clients' money. But after all, there is a risk to every investment and it is sometimes impossible to accurately predict what return a particular investment will generate. Let me consider other asset classes. Take the housing market. You are about to buy an apartment and you do not know exactly where the housing market will go next year. You take a loan to finance at least a part of your apartment buy. But you can use that apartment to live in or you can buy it to let. In the first case, it will serve yourself or your family. In the second case, you will end up getting a fixed income. An apartment is also tangible. In other words, you see what you buy, which is not the case with Bitcoin. Moreover, the housing market may collapse, and occasionally there are bubbles. Just think of the 2008-2009 collapse. However, unless there is a war or a natural disaster, your apartment's value won't fall to zero, regardless of how bad the crisis is. The value of Bitcoin, in contrast, can fall to zero. Last month, for example, the second-largest crypto exchange FTX (FTT-USD) filed for bankruptcy last month. Many cryptocurrencies fall to zero. For example, Luna's (LUNC-USD) value fell to zero and was therefore delisted from Binance (BNB-USD). You might argue that it won't happen to Bitcoin since it is a highly liquid cryptocurrency. It may not happen, of course. But there are enough risks BTC may fail the way some of its fellow cryptocurrencies did. An investment should also have intrinsic value. There is a market value to any asset, in other words, the price the buyer is willing to pay and the seller is willing to sell their asset for. However, besides that, an asset also has a true value it is really worth. Let us also take a construction company. It generates net cash flows and has some net assets (asset - liabilities) on its balance sheet. You can determine the company's intrinsic value by estimating its NPV (Net Present Value of its future net cash flows) or simply taking its net asset or book value. The company also does business, and has a reputation and a future. True, there is a possibility its financial reports may turn out to be inaccurate. Remember the Enron case. Something also can go wrong, for example, a recession might happen. But normally you know what you pay for. Bitcoin in turn has no financials at all. It does not own any assets. When you buy it, you buy unaudited and unverifiable electronic entries. Not to mention that, unlike bonds and stocks, cryptocurrencies don't generate any passive income whatsoever. You might also like to compare Bitcoin to gold, at least many media persons do. But, in my opinion, this is incorrect. I agree with the thesis that fiat money keeps losing value at a fast enough pace. Most of this actually happened due to central banks' attempts to support their economies during the COVID-19 lockdowns. But gold has been existing for thousands of years as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Crypto technologies in turn are very new. Gold can also be used as a commodity. It is still used in producing appliances but most importantly jewelry. Central banks also hold physical gold bars as their strategic reserves. Holding Bitcoins instead would have been easier and less costly but they don't do this. Instead, they have recently been buying more gold. So, gold and cryptocurrencies are different stories. Now let us consider the future of Bitcoin as money. BTC and functions of money Many analysts say that Bitcoin can effectively be used as money. But here are the functions of money:   It is a medium of exchange - in other words, it has to be accepted in exchange for goods and services.  It is a store of value - we save it to use later.  Unit of account - we use it to measure value in economic transactions.  Very well. But which one of these functions does Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency perform? To start with, we cannot use Bitcoin as a proper store of value. Why is that? Because its price is highly volatile. Let us have a look at the diagram below. It shows BTC's three-year price history. Data by YCharts In the spring of this year, Bitcoin's price was lingering around the $45,000 mark. Now it is somewhat more than $15,000. It took just about 6 months for this cryptocurrency to lose two-thirds of its value. So, it is very unreliable to keep your savings in BTC to later buy, a car or a house, for example. For this very reason I believe BTC cannot be used as a unit of account. It is very hard to put a price tag of 3 BTC on your car, for instance. It is possible, of course, but in that case your car would be worth $45,000 ($15,000 per BTC) today but $15,000 or, say, $150,000 tomorrow since Bitcoin is quite volatile unlike fiat money. It could, in fact, be used as a medium of exchange but not everyone would accept BTC as a payment for goods or services due to Bitcoin's very high volatility. Also, in some countries there are rigid rules and regulations aimed at controlling cryptocurrencies. That is because cryptocurrencies are sometimes used in shadowy transactions. Bank transfers are very easy to monitor unlike crypto payments. But I will touch this subject later on. Risks You might be thinking that I am absolutely sure the BTC would collapse in value in 2023. I do in fact accept the possibility it may not happen. One of the possible reasons for Bitcoin's COVID-19 price surge was the Fed's and many other central banks' endless money printing. Many financial institutions and private individuals were therefore left with plenty of idle cash they wanted to invest. Some of them decided to buy cryptocurrencies in order to ""hedge"" money from inflation. So, if the Fed eases its monetary policies, BTC might surge again. There is a feature of BTC that is somewhat in favor of it: namely its limited supply. Technically, only 21 million Bitcoins can be mined. However, in my view, this on its own does not make BTC a valuable investment with high intrinsic value. Another factor that can make the BTC appreciate is its legalization. For example, earlier on there were rumors a new cryptocurrency would be created in Ecuador and backed by gold to facilitate transactions across the country. The idea was not realized, however. But there is a possibility some countries might issue more lenient laws regulating Bitcoin. Some developing countries, especially the ones struggling with hyperinflation, might even legalize BTC as an alternative currency. If that happens, Bitcoin will be here to gain. However, this is highly uncertain and even unlikely. After all, many governments worry about the anonymity characteristic of BTC transactions. So, in fact it is likely many new stricter regulations will be passed in the field. Valuation As I have mentioned before, I believe Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. So, it is hard to estimate its real value the way we can do it for stocks and even ETFs. However, we can have a closer look at this cryptocurrency's price history. Data by YCharts Here is Bitcoin's 10-year price history graph above. It is, indeed, very volatile. It surged tremendously in 2020 but now it is trading down substantially. Data by YCharts As the diagram above suggests, Bitcoin is down 75% from its all-time highs. Data by YCharts Concurrently, if one had invested $10,000 10 years ago, one would have ended up with almost $294,000 now. I know how attractive this sounds. But it could well be that the bubble is bursting right now. In 2020 I wrote an article about investing in Bitcoin when the price of that cryptocurrency was surging and said it was not a good idea. But we can actually compare the ""cryptomania"" to other historical asset bubbles. I am sure everyone heard of the tulipmania happening in the Netherlands in the 17th century, the South Sea bubble and of course the Dot.com bubble in the 2000s. There are many more examples of this. But they all show that a ""trendy"" asset class is only worth as much as the market is willing to pay for it. Trendy assets are not normally worth much at all but due to many investors' enthusiasm, their prices kept surging. Asset bubbles end quite bad. A similar situation seems to be happening now. Conclusion Don't get me wrong. I appreciate crypto technologies have a future. But I do not like the idea of buying any cryptocurrency, Bitcoin included. There is a possibility it would soar to all-time highs. But eventually, in my view, it should reach its intrinsic value, zero. There is too much volatility and too much uncertainty. But it is an interesting speculative asset, by all means. If you hold Bitcoins and they have lost some of their value, you might be lucky next year if they surge. This could happen if the Fed gets more dovish. But I do not recommend buying BTC to conservative investors just because it is off its highs.

The criminal charges against Bankman-Fried filed by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York include eight different counts, covering allegations of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. The former CEO also faces a complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission which is investigating him for securities law violations and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also piled on. “SBF’s arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against SBF and is likely to request his extradition,” said Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder about the matter. Pinder added that authorities would hold Bankman-Fried in accordance with the nation’s extradition agreement with the U.S. Bankman-Fried’s arrest came a day before his expected virtual testimony in front of the House Financial Services Committee today about the catastrophic implosion of his crypto empire. In the month after the collapse of FTX, he has been making the rounds pleading his case in the media, and to his former colleagues, trying to paint himself as apologetic about the failure as if it were largely incompetence and out of his control. The saga began with documents leaked by CoinDesk revealing that FTX was using its native FTT cryptocurrency tokens as collateral for billions of crypto loans, between itself and its sister company Alameda Research. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO of Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume, then announced it was going to withdraw its take in FTT, which caused FTX to have a liquidity crisis and revealed that FTX was insolvent. Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO during the Nov. 11 bankruptcy of FTX and was replaced by John Ray III, who, after reviewing the corporate structure of the company, said in a court filing that he has never in his entire career “seen such a complete failure of corporate controls.” SEC and CTFC pile on complaints The Securities and Exchange Commission also officially charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors. The commission also stated that it is continuing investigations into other securities law violations as well. The SEC’s complaint alleges that FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from investors and represented itself as “a safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform” but in reality, he was committing what the commission called “years-long fraud” concealing the diversion of customer funds to Alameda Research and undisclosed risk. The complaint also alleges that Bankman-Fried mismanaged customer funds at Alameda to make venture investments, real estate purchases and political donations. “We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.” The SEC also seeks to block Bankman-Fried from participating in future activities involving securities such as the issuance, purchase, offer or sale, except for his own personal use. In a “parallel action” the Commodities Futures Trading Commission also today announced charges against Bankman-Fried alleging that Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives used hundreds of millions of dollars of loans, reported Bloomberg. Allegations in the complaint included charges that FTX comingled customer funds and that Bankman-Fried violated the Commodities Exchange Act. “At Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives created features in the underlying code for FTX that allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX,” the CFTC said in the complaint. In the filing, the CFTC alleged that Alameda Research was able to access as much as “$8 billion in customer funds” from an account that was earmarked for FTX but was controlled by Alameda. Further stating that the use of customer funds by Alameda was not authorized by FTX customers, nor were customers made aware, thus this was in violation of the contractual terms of service of the exchange.

Today, we introduce a new weekly video feature, allowing our audience to catch up with the hottest news from the crypto sector in a new format.   This week, we will cover Orthogonal Trading’s loan default, Ren Protocol’s warning to users, Nomad’s bridge relaunch, Binance’s Proof of Reserves, and the FTX hearings.   Orthogonal Trading Defaults On Loans The week saw Orthogonal Trading default on eight loans worth $36 million. The loans were taken on DeFi lending platform Maple Finance. The default occurred because Orthogonal’s funds were tied up with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and impacted 30% of all active loans on the protocol. As a result of the default, Maple Finance severed all ties with Orthogonal Trading. Ren Protocol Warns Users Of Potential Loss Of Funds Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol has warned its users that they risk losing their funds as it prepares to shutter its current Ren Version 1.0. According to the Ren team, once the current version is retired, users will not be able to recover their funds. The team encouraged users to redeem their tokens before the current version shuts down and their assets lose their value. Nomad To Relaunch Bridge Cross-chain bridge Nomad has announced that it will be relaunching its bridge after suffering a crippling hack in August. The Nomad team also stated that it would be offering impacted users partial refunds. Nomad suffered a serious exploit in August when malicious actors discovered a loophole in Nomad’s smart contracts, resulting in the protocol losing $190 million. Binance Reveals Proof of Reserves The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, announced that it completed an independent audit of its reserves. The audit confirmed that the exchange’s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized. The audit was carried out by the global audit and advisory company Mazars. The audit set several minds at ease, as it revealed that customer assets are safe and sound. FTX Hearings To Take Place This Week The Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee have confirmed that they will be holding hearings this week to look into the astonishing collapse of the FTX exchange and its sister concern, Alameda Research. The Committees also asked FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to appear before them and stated that subpoenas could be an option if Bankman-Fried refused to appear before the committees.

One of the most prominent of these was the inclusion of bitcoin into retirement plans such as 401Ks. As the price of BTC has suffered in the past year, the plans holding BTC have also seen a massive decline, prompting calls to remove the asset from these important plans. However, not everyone has lost their faith in the digital asset, and one of those is Senator Cynthia Lummis. Bitcoin Still In The Running Speaking with Semafor on Monday, Senator Cynthia Lummis once again showed support for bitcoin. The US lawmaker has been vocal about her bullishness when it comes to the digital asset and believes that having the option to have BTC in retirement plans is still a good move.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609691 = window.pid609691 || rnd;                 var plc609691 = window.plc609691 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609691;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609691 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609691++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc367529 = window.plc367529 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc367529:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_367529_' + plc367529;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 367529,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_367529_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc367529++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  Related Reading: Paxful CEO Warns Investors To Not Leave Their Bitcoin On Exchanges For Lummis, bitcoin presented a unique opportunity given that it is different from other cryptocurrencies. “I’m very comfortable with making sure that people can include Bitcoin in their retirement funds because it’s just different than other cryptocurrencies,” the senator said.

The rally has seen Bitcoin hit a new four-week high, with investors monitoring the asset’s price movement for a bottom that would likely usher in a new price breakout. Based on the flagship cryptocurrency’s latest price movement, Kitco News analyst Jim Wycoff on December 13 pointed out that Bitcoin has potentially begun a ‘bullish upside breakout.’  According to Wycoff, Bitcoin bulls have built a near-term technical advantage after a tussle of almost equal strengths.   “Today’s price action has produced what looks to be the beginning of a bullish upside “breakout” from the choppy and sideways trading range on the daily bar chart to suggest a price uptrend will develop. Bulls have gained the near-term technical advantage,” Wycoff said.   Bitcoin candle chart.

The latest data showed that November inflation came in at 7.1% on a year-on-year basis compared to the 7.3% forecast, while monthly CPI was 0.1% less versus the 0.3% expected. In this line, the crypto market has been monitoring the inflation data since it will determine the Fed’s next policy on interest rates. Overall, Bitcoin has been weighed by the high inflation with the tighter monetary policy putting pressure on risky assets. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $17,791, recording daily gains of almost 5% while weekly gains stand at 4.5%.  Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold.  Bitcoin is looking forward to reclaiming the $18,000 zone that acted as a critical support level for the asset in recent weeks. However, with inflation cooling down, the ability of Bitcoin to sustain the gains will mostly depend on the bull’s potential to overpower bears.  In recent weeks, Bitcoin has consolidated around the $17,000 level. Notably, if Bitcoin fails to hold the $17,000 position, the asset will be in line for a possible further correction.  Bitcoin technical analysis Elsewhere, Bitcoin’s latest gains have been reflected in the asset’s technical analysis.

Less attention is paid to the demand side, even though traditional monetary economics itself gives equal weight to both. There are lessons from recent history. For example, central banks were forced to abandon money-supply targeting as the intermediate goal of monetary policy because demand for money became unstable after the 1980s, as household and firms got a greater choice of financial instruments to hold. They shifted to interest rate targets. More recently, the value of Bitcoin swung wildly not because of instability of supply, but sudden changes in demand from users. Bitcoin was supposed to guarantee monetary stability by managing money supply through an algorithm rather than human agency; the demand side was given inadequate attention.

Industrial policy eyes forex pile for finance  Cooling hiring frenzy is good news for IT firms  Cartels may get to settle cases without admitting offence              RBI has chosen two very different designs for the two variants of the new digital rupee. The wholesale variant operates through the accounts that commercial banks have with the Indian central bank. The retail variant is based on a two-tier system—individuals and firms can hold it only through the banking system. It is thus based on the idea of tokens. RBI will issue the digital rupee but banks will distribute it to the private sector.              What this means is that the first experiments with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in India do not try to alter the current monetary system, in which only banks have accounts with RBI while the rest of the economy operates through the commercial banking system. Economist James Tobin proposed in 1985 that households should be allowed to have direct accounts with the US central bank. The radical innovation of allowing citizens to have direct accounts with the Indian central bank has been put off for now, and rightly so.              The digital rupee does not pay any interest to its holder. It is thus a substitute for cash rather than a substitute for bank deposits. Why? Cash is also a liability of the central bank that is issued at zero interest rate. An interest-paying CBDC held directly with RBI would give bank deposits a run for their money, creating financial stability risks. It will also complicate the conduct of monetary policy, especially when households move money between their accounts with commercial banks and the central bank, leading to fluctuations in the monetary base. However, there is no doubt that the truly radical possibilities of a CBDC will be tested when citizens bank directly with the central bank.              Now comes the question of demand, especially for the retail version of the digital rupee. In the quarter ended March 2022, Indian households held  ₹28.83 trillion of cash as compared to  ₹115.71 trillion of bank deposits. A recent research paper by economists at the International Monetary Fund shows that the use of cash as a mode of payment has actually grown in India between 2005 and 2020 (though the past three years have seen a decline in this share) . The use of instant payment options such as NEFT and IMPS has shot up. The use of cheques and demand drafts has dropped sharply (see chart for international comparisons). The Indian government is keen to reduce the use of cash in the economy. Will the digital rupee help?              The current design of the Indian CBDC is focused on money as a medium of exchange rather than a store of value. India already has a world-class digital payments system, or the United Payments Interface (UPI). It has become ubiquitous in most parts of the country. The current version of the retail CBDC—admittedly an initial experiment to feel the waters—has to compete with the UPI ecosystem. It will be worth seeing how that works out in the coming months.              In the early years of the 20th century, a group of monetary theorists known as chartalists argued that modern money has no intrinsic value but is widely accepted in a territory because the government requires that you pay taxes in that money. Even earlier, during another era of monetary innovation, a wise man said: “A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money"". That was Adam Smith in his classic book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776.              Does that idea deserve a fresh airing in this new age of CBDCs?

Companies are clearly nervous about the incoming recession and are starting to batten down the hatches as the storm brews. On the face of it, the jobless rate has registered a small, expected uptick rising to 3.7% from 3.6% last month, but there is added weakness is showing up in the decline in the number of job vacancies. They fell by 65 thousand, the fifth consecutive monthly decline as firms fearful of the bumpy road ahead have become more cautious about taking on too many staff. More people are leaving the inactive masses, clearly keen to earn extra money as the cost-of-living crisis intensifies but the overall rate remains stubbornly high. With the fight for talent easing a little though, it’s welcome news on the inflation front as this may start to dampen down wage demand spiral, which the Bank of England fears could become embedded in the economy. But with the UK still in the grip of strikes, and the clamour for higher pay still so being heard so loud, this will take time to filter through. It’s still forecast that Bank of England policymakers will vote for a rate rise of 0.5% when they meet on Thursday. Expectations that inflation is on the way down in the United States, the world’s largest economy has helped stocks lift in Asia after a relief rally on Wall Street. US Consumer inflation expectations for the next year have fallen back and that has helped a more positive sentiment to spread amid hopes it will mean the Federal Reserve won’t have to be so tough in terms of steep interest rate rises, with a crunch decision due tomorrow. The official CPI inflation print is due out as trading gets underway on US indices, so there is likely to be an element of caution as indices open in Europe.Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now?

His rise to power and riches and dramatic fall from grace, epitomises the dangerous rollercoaster ride of the crypto wild west, where so many schemes have crashed and burned. His company spent huge sums, advertising its ‘credibility’ and up to a million people put cash into the exchange. Now many fear they will not get their life savings back, and its 50 largest creditors are thought to be owed almost $3.1 billion. The implosion of FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto world – and Bankman Fried’s arrest sent Bitcoin back on another volatile ride. The scandal has reinvigorated lawmakers and regulators determination to regulate crypto, not just in the US but around the world. They will be walking a tricky tightrope. It’s clear that much better safeguards need to be in place to ensure consumers are more protected from another FTX style implosion, but at the same time regulators also don’t want to quash innovation in the digital coin and blockchain space. The challenge will be incubating, without giving too much legitimacy to an industry where fraud is rife and the intrinsic value of coins and tokens is sorely lacking. With the European Central Bank warning that Bitcoin is in its last gasp, there is a danger that other jurisdictions could be seen as a safe haven for illegal money if their arms open too wide to welcome the crypto industry.’’ Article by Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown      (Free Video) The 2 Secrets To Finding Small-Cap, Hidden Gem Stock Opportunities To Dramatically Grow Your Portfolio in Q4  .

This year’s report, which includes insights generated from the 21 million Americans who filed their taxes with the company in 2022, reveals that the ways people are earning a living and financing their lifestyles continues to shift significantly. This shift includes the rise of side hustles, post-retirement gig jobs and solopreneurs. “We’re excited to again unveil insights and identify trends that tell a story of the many ways people are creating income, year-over-year,” said Karen Orosco, H&R Block’s President, Global Consumer Tax and Service Delivery. “It’s clear the American landscape is shifting, and we are proud to meet those evolving needs as a company, whether through our financial product offerings, do-it-yourself and assisted tax platforms, or support for small business customers.” Gathering insights from actual tax return data nationwide, the ‘Outlook on American Life’ report provides a unique and clear perspective on how everyday Americans are adjusting to changing economic dynamics. Everything from people’s new sources of income, changes in working and retirement ages, how they’re investing for their future, and more, all point to a continuing shift in mindsets and approaches to how we live our financial lives. Do The ‘Side’ Hustle Despite economic uncertainty, small business growth continued to rise significantly this past year – a stark contrast to what we saw during the pandemic nationwide.   Demonstrating how the pandemic was a catalyst fueling many Americans to rethink their employment and be their own boss – in tax year 2022, H&R Block saw 168,000 new Schedule C tax filers (demonstrating sole proprietorship), a 26% increase from the prior tax year. While this evolution is happening nationwide, some of our warmer climate states like Florida and Texas are really proving to be havens for new business with more small businesses opened compared to before the pandemic. While some may still think of small business owners in the brick-and-mortar mindset, the reality is that gig work is fueling a lot of new solopreneurs – or individuals who start and run a business independently without the support of a co-founder or W-2 employees. In the past year, more Americans have turned to gig work as their primary source of income with ride-sharing services and home rentals as the top categories for new business filings. App-based drivers increased by nearly 48%, and individuals who rented out their cars or homes rose by 152%. Booming Out of Retirement Back to Work The report also gives a peek into how retirement is changing across the nation. Insights from the report reveal an increase in the number of retirees taking on side hustles to maintain income and to avoid tapping their retirement accounts. As costs of living rose nationwide, and opportunities for income-generation continue to diversify with gig work, we saw that four percent of retirees “unretired,” or left retirement and rejoined the workforce in tax season 2022. Additionally, the report showed that the number of H&R Block clients who took pension distributions, qualified retirement payments, or social security in tax season 2022 dropped for the first time by 2%. ‘“What we’re seeing is likely surprising to this generation who greatly anticipated their retirement, not their un-retirement,” said Orosco. “With continued financial challenges and inflation concerns, many retirement age Americans are actively seeking ways to augment their income. We see our clients demonstrating incredible resilience and finding new ways to apply the skills they built before they retired.” The Crypto Craze Continued Despite continued volatility in the crypto markets, data shows Americans’ interest in the cryptocurrency industry did not slowdown last year. In fact, the number of crypto owners in the US nearly doubled in tax season 2022 with 44% of respondents saying they first bought crypto in the past year.* Correspondingly, we saw an 85% rise in the number of clients who reported crypto transactions, or buying or selling of those currencies. Crypto has shown it's not immune to the ups and downs of the financial markets so it will continue to be an area to watch in the year ahead. Whether you “buy and hold” like 85% of crypto owners do, or actively trade like 38% of owners do, it’s a constantly evolving marketplace that requires attention and help in navigating for taxes year-round.  For more information and insights from H&R Block please visit www.OutlookonAmericanLife.com. *Gemini 2022 Global State of Crypto About H&R BlockH&R Block, Inc.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 13, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) … [+5441 chars]",Marketscreener.com,"Drawing insights from its 21 million customers, the second annual report finds side hustles, post-retirement gigs and solopreneurs to be on the riseKANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec.  13, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Americans of all ages are finding different means of earning money, according to the latest ‘Outlook on American Life’ report from H&R Block (NYSE: HRB). This year’s report, which includes insights generated from the 21 million Americans who filed their taxes with the company in 2022, reveals that the ways people are earning a living and financing their lifestyles continues to shift significantly. This shift includes the rise of side hustles, post-retirement gig jobs and solopreneurs.    “We’re excited to again unveil insights and identify trends that tell a story of the many ways people are creating income, year-over-year,” said Karen Orosco, H&R Block’s President, Global Consumer Tax and Service Delivery. “It’s clear the American landscape is shifting, and we are proud to meet those evolving needs as a company, whether through our financial product offerings, do-it-yourself and assisted tax platforms, or support for small business customers.”    Gathering insights from actual tax return data nationwide, the ‘Outlook on American Life’ report provides a unique and clear perspective on how everyday Americans are adjusting to changing economic dynamics. Everything from people’s new sources of income, changes in working and retirement ages, how they’re investing for their future, and more, all point to a continuing shift in mindsets and approaches to how we live our financial lives.Do The ‘Side’ Hustle    Despite economic uncertainty, small business growth continued to rise significantly this past year – a stark contrast to what we saw during the pandemic nationwide.   Demonstrating how the pandemic was a catalyst fueling many Americans to rethink their employment and be their own boss – in tax year 2022, H&R Block saw 168,000 new Schedule C tax filers (demonstrating sole proprietorship), a 26% increase from the prior tax year. While this evolution is happening nationwide, some of our warmer climate states like Florida and Texas are really proving to be havens for new business with more small businesses opened compared to before the pandemic.    While some may still think of small business owners in the brick-and-mortar mindset, the reality is that gig work is fueling a lot of new solopreneurs – or individuals who start and run a business independently without the support of a co-founder or W-2 employees. In the past year, more Americans have turned to gig work as their primary source of income with ride-sharing services and home rentals as the top categories for new business filings. App-based drivers increased by nearly 48%, and individuals who rented out their cars or homes rose by 152%.Booming Out of Retirement Back to Work    The report also gives a peek into how retirement is changing across the nation. Insights from the report reveal an increase in the number of retirees taking on side hustles to maintain income and to avoid tapping their retirement accounts. As costs of living rose nationwide, and opportunities for income-generation continue to diversify with gig work, we saw that four percent of retirees “unretired,” or left retirement and rejoined the workforce in tax season 2022.    Additionally, the report showed that the number of H&R Block clients who took pension distributions, qualified retirement payments, or social security in tax season 2022 dropped for the first time by 2%.    ‘“What we’re seeing is likely surprising to this generation who greatly anticipated their retirement, not their un-retirement,” said Orosco. “With continued financial challenges and inflation concerns, many retirement age Americans are actively seeking ways to augment their income. We see our clients demonstrating incredible resilience and finding new ways to apply the skills they built before they retired.”The Crypto Craze Continued    Despite continued volatility in the crypto markets, data shows Americans’ interest in the cryptocurrency industry did not slowdown last year. In fact, the number of crypto owners in the US nearly doubled in tax season 2022 with 44% of respondents saying they first bought crypto in the past year.* Correspondingly, we saw an 85% rise in the number of clients who reported crypto transactions, or buying or selling of those currencies.    Crypto has shown it's not immune to the ups and downs of the financial markets so it will continue to be an area to watch in the year ahead. Whether you “buy and hold” like 85% of crypto owners do, or actively trade like 38% of owners do, it’s a constantly evolving marketplace that requires attention and help in navigating for taxes year-round.     For more information and insights from H&R Block please visit www.OutlookonAmericanLife.com.    *Gemini 2022 Global State of CryptoAbout H&R BlockH&R Block, Inc.

The fact is, crypto is a garden of snakes,” said Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee.            Sherman — who also likened crypto to an “electronic pet rock” — is a known critic of cryptocurrencies, and his comments came at a hearing at which Bankman-Fried was due to appear. The FTX founder is alleged to have stolen from FTX customers and lied to investors about using deposits to bankroll risky bets by his Alameda hedge fund, as MarketWatch has reported.

Patrick McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who will lead the Financial Services Committee in the next Congress, promised Tuesday to call Gensler for testimony “early and often” next year, even as he said he believes in the promise of digital assets.

Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's disgraced former CEO, had supported the bill. FTX lobbied for it more than any other legislation in 2022, according to OpenSecrets. The shocking collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has increased the urgency in Congress to understand what went wrong and pass legislation to try to prevent another debacle that would affect hundreds of thousands of investors.One bill, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, introduced in August, gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more authority to regulate digital commodities like FTX.The bill arrived before FTX's collapse ignited fresh debate over how to protect consumers in the relatively young and untamed crypto industry. It is among a handful of solutions lawmakers will consider as they begin to probe the implosion of FTX with high-stakes hearings this week — and try to implement safeguards across the industry.New FTX CEO John J. Ray is scheduled to testify before the House on Tuesday. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also set to testify at the House hearing — and had refused to testify in a Senate hearing set for Wednesday — before his arrest in the Bahamas Monday night.  Bankman-Fried was charged in a U.S. indictment with eight criminal counts: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November after revelations that Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried, had secretly borrowed and traded billions of dollars from FTX customers.""Stakeholders from all sides, providers, customers, and lawmakers, should be closely watching this space, because it is evident that Congress will not be able to ignore an increasingly dissatisfied public's call to action, and there is a lot of potential to get this wrong,"" Jenny Lee, a partner at law firm Reed Smith and a former bank regulator, told CNBC.Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., the DCCPA's sponsor and chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, which oversees commodities, said the bill will close the gap in federal regulation of spot crypto assets that are not considered securities. This applies to some digital currencies. Securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.""The DCCPA does not take authority away from other financial regulators. Nor does it make the CFTC the 'primary' crypto regulator,"" Stabenow said during an agriculture committee hearing Dec. 1. ""Because crypto assets can be used in many different ways, no single financial regulator has the expertise or the authority to regulate the entire industry.""Joe Silvia, an attorney who advises financial institutions on corporate and regulatory matters, told CNBC that had the bill already been law, it may have helped to avoid the FTX debacle.""I think the reality is if there was actual transparency that the legislation would be getting at ... there wouldn't be folks, I would hope, knowingly depositing their money with an exchange knowing that the exchange was taking that money and using it for proprietary trading with a sister company,"" Silvia said. But Lee said consumer advocates, crypto enthusiasts and lawmakers are ""going to have plenty of reasons to take offense at the legislation."" The bill would require entities seeking to become digital commodities platforms to register with the CFTC as a commodities broker, a custodian, a dealer or trading facility. Brokers would be required to establish fair, objective prices, set up risk management systems and conform to business product standards, while trading facilities must provide a competitive, open market for transactions and protect customers from abuse.The bill would also establish core principles that platforms must abide by, including providing records of transactions to the CFTC when requested.The commission would become the rulemaking authority on margined, leveraged or financed digital commodity trades. Under the bill, digital commodity platforms would become financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, beholden to help the U.S. government detect and prevent money laundering.Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a co-sponsor of the bill and a member of the agriculture committee, said the bill would have ""solved many problems we've had recently"" — if FTX had been registered in the United States. The company is headquartered in the Bahamas.""Many of the actions that have been allegedly perpetrated actually have been crimes in this country for over a century,"" Booker said during the Dec. 1 hearing. ""And so the legislation is not going to solve everything. But I think it's important that we move forward with providing a regulatory framework that can protect consumers."" Despite the allegations later made against him and his company, Bankman-Fried supported the DCCPA. FTX lobbied for the bill more than any other legislation in 2022, according to watchdog OpenSecrets.Brandon Neal, chief operating officer of decentralized finance protocol Euler Finance, told CNBC that Bankman-Fried ""attempted to shape this piece of legislation in a way that would have been detrimental to decentralized finance."" An earlier draft of the DCCPA was said to effectively ban decentralized finance providers, or DeFi, which are services on public blockchains that allow users to borrow, lend and trade crypto assets without paperwork or a third party. DeFi supporters have argued the bill favors exchanges such as FTX, according to The Block, a digital assets news website.Neal said the bill Bankman-Fried lobbied for ""would have built a moat around his now-defunct exchange, FTX."" CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam told the agriculture committee at the Dec. 1 hearing that he couldn't speak to FTX's motivations for supporting the bill.""The remarkable thing is to think about it in the context of what we've learned about the FTX entities and just thinking about the bill that [Sens. Stabenow and Boozman] introduced. [FTX] would have been so far out of compliance, that it just wouldn't have been possible,"" he said.Officials at FTX, who were prolific donors during the midterm elections this year, also donated to members of the agriculture committee.Stabenow and committee ranking member Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., both received $23,200 in campaign contributions from individuals at FTX, according to OpenSecrets. Booker received $5,700 from individuals at FTX, according to The Washington Post.Days after FTX's implosion, Lisa Braganca, a former enforcement branch chief at the SEC, said Bankman-Fried's close association with those on Capitol Hill made her doubtful that Congress would act on the DCCPA.""Look at how much work [Bankman-Fried] was doing to get someone to step up and get regulation done, and now it's all fallen through,"" Braganca said in a Nov. 16 interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover."" Opponents of the legislation have criticized the power it grants to the CFTC relative to other financial regulators.Lee, the former bank regulator, said the bill could put disproportionate power in the hands of the CFTC.""In urging the public to embrace the DCCPA, the call to action makes a plea for a 'whole of government' approach, but ironically, the DCCPA gives the CFTC disproportionately more power than any other agency that has an interest, including the SEC, the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau], the prudential banking regulators, and Treasury or [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network],"" Lee told CNBC.""The legislation even authorizes the CFTC to decide what is and is not covered within its own ambit of jurisdiction, and in so doing, may allow the CFTC to put its thumb on the scale in a way that edges other regulators out,"" she added.SEC Chair Gary Gensler said Wednesday that his agency already has the tools needed to regulate crypto firms and other securities.A Treasury Department official declined to comment on the DCCPA but said its Financial Stability Oversight Council has called for spot market regulation consistent with the bill.The DCCPA is good, thoughtful legislation, Silvia said. But he cautioned against passing a bill too quickly without considering the size and nature of the FTX collapse.""I think that there's more information, there are more facts that need to be found,"" he said. ""And I think until that gets figured out, I don't think it's helpful to rush through legislation. I think there's more to learn here that can really educate the legislators, as they're doing.""",2022-12-13

According to Ray, Alameda Research had been dependent on funds from FTX Trading — the international arm of the FTX Group — with “no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever” between the two firms.The FTX CEO testified that the owners of both Alameda and FTX — referring to Bankman-Fried — could “run free rein” across most of the firms in the FTX Group, with any separation more of a distinction made to the public rather than the reality. Addressing questions from Missouri Representative Ann Wagner, Ray added that FTX’s financial difficulties differed from high-profile failures like those at energy giant ENRON in that there was “no record keeping whatsoever” with many invoices and expense receipts going through Slack.“[FTX] used Quickbooks — a multi-billion-dollar company using Quickbooks,” said Ray. “Nothing against Quickbooks — very nice tool — just not for a multi-billion-dollar company.”FTX CEO John Ray addressing the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Dec. 13Many House members addressing the FTX CEO questioned whether Bankman-Fried’s actions may have been willful or due to gross incompetence. Wagner brought up SBF’s “apology tour” in the media following FTX’s bankruptcy, in which he claimed to have made “a lot of mistakes” in transferring FTX users to Alameda.“I don’t find any such statements to be credible,” said Ray.Texas Representative Al Green quoted Martin Luther King Jr. in a seeming attempt to understand Bankman-Fried’s actions — “nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity” — and whether there was “malfeasance” at FTX. “Mr. Bankman-Fried has pretty much indicated that he just made a big mistake, that he was doing the best that he could to be a servant of great service to humankind,” said Green. “I find it difficult to believe we’re dealing with conscientious stupidity.” Oklahoma Representative Frank Lucas added:“Bankman-Fried clearly tried to exhibit himself as the brightest of the bright, but being bright neither makes you honest nor a fool, does it?”Though Bankman-Fried was not on hand to testify before the committee, lawmakers confirmed the contents of written testimony leaked following his arrest. Missouri Representative Emanuel Cleaver called SBF’s immediate use of profanity in his opening statement “disrespectful” and “absolutely insulting” to Congress. The lawmaker added he would be considering introducing a resolution to rename cryptocurrency “creepy dough currency” in light of recent events.Related: FTX was an 'utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization', says new CEOThe House committee hearing was the second exploring the collapse of FTX following a Dec. 1 hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee, in which Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Rostin Behnam was the sole witness.

The Senate Banking Committee has also scheduled a hearing for Dec. 14, with Hollywood star Ben McKenzie, investor Kevin O'Leary, law professor Hilary Allen and Jennifer Schulp, the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, appearing as witnesses. It’s unclear whether lawmakers will call on Bankman-Fried to testify amid his current legal issues.Ranking member Patrick McHenry said the committee planned to hold a second hearing on the collapse of FTX sometime in 2023.

Joh… [+5377 chars]",New York Post,"FTX’s new CEO blasted Sam Bankman-Fried and his top business associates during scorched-earth testimony before a key House panel on Tuesday — just hours after the disgraced ex-billionaire’s arrest. John Ray III — a restructuring expert who steered Enron through its bankruptcy — told lawmakers that Bankman-Fried ran the doomed cryptocurrency platform into the ground with a complete lack of recordkeeping and with shady business practices — including funneling billions in client funds to the cryptocurrency hedge fund Alameda Research.   “FTX Group’s collapse appears to stem from the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people’s money or assets,” Ray said in his opening statement. At one point, the new FTX boss shocked lawmakers by revealing that Bankman-Fried and his associates used QuickBooks, Intuit’s bookkeeping software for small businesses, to manage its sprawling cryptocurrency empire. “There’s no recordkeeping whatsoever, there’s an absence of recordkeeping,” Ray said. “They used QuickBooks, a multibillion-dollar company using QuickBooks. Nothing against QuickBooks, it’s a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.”   3  FTX CEO John Ray testified before a key House panel.REUTERS Shares of Intuit were trading 6% higher on Tuesday after the unexpected shoutout. The testimony shed new light on the chaos that defined FTX’s operations as $8 billion in client funds went missing.

Bankman-Fried was originally slated to testify at the same hearing as Ray, but he was arrested in the Bahamas before that could occur. Ray noted that he and other FTX caretakers are in the midst of a “truly enormous” investigation into the circumstances that led to the platform’s meltdown. “While many things are unknown at this stage, and many questions remain, we know the following: First, customer assets from FTX.com were commingled with assets from the Alameda trading platform — that much is clear,” Ray added. “Second, Alameda used client funds to engage in margin trading, which exposed customer funds to massive losses.” Ray made several eye-opening assertions in his remarks to Congress — noting that Bankman-Fried had received “numerous loans, some of which were documented,” during his time running the company. In one case, the 30-year-old signed as both the issuer and the recipient of a loan. The purpose of those loans is under investigation.   3  John Ray took over as FTX’s CEO after Bankman-Fried’s resignation.REUTERS Ray also indicated the company was still “investigating” the extent to which Bankman-Fried’s parents, Stanford law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, were involved in FTX’s operations.        see also             Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents staying in Bahamas, fear his legal fees will ‘wipe them out’       Ray confirmed that Bankman had advised FTX and that the family had “received payments” from the company. The feds hit Bankman-Fried with an array of charges, including conspiracy to defraud the US, wire fraud, securities fraud and campaign finance violations, according to an indictment that was unsealed earlier in the day. Separately, the SEC accused Bankman-Fried of bilking FTX investors out of $1.8 billion. House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) criticized federal authorities for opting to arrest Bankman-Fried on the eve of his planned appearance. “The timing of his arrest denies the public the opportunity to get the answers they deserve,” Waters added. “Rest assured that this committee will not stop until we uncover the full truth behind the collapse of FTX.” Ranking member Patrick McHenry (R-NC) called Bankman-Fried’s arrest “welcome news” but noted the committee still needed to conduct a full examination of what transpired at FTX. “We’ve heard everything but the truth. Tweets, DMs and interviews are no substitute for the facts,” McHenry said. “Bankman-Fried’s play is nothing new — we’ve seen it before.”   3  Sam Bankman-Fried was slated to testify prior to his arrest.AFP via Getty Images A draft of Bankman-Fried’s prepared remarks reportedly revealed that he had planned to lash out at Ray on Capitol Hill. The FTX founder wrote that he regretted filing for bankruptcy and accused the Ray-led FTX leadership team of ignoring his attempts to make contact.

Bankman-Fried, Ray and FTX’s bankruptcy attorneys have exchanged several public barbs in recent days. Last week, Bankman-Fried alleged during a podcast interview that Ray had made “false” statements about FTX’s operations in the company’s court filings. “There have been a lot of statements that have been made, that have been put on legal record, that I know to be false,” Bankman-Fried claimed.   “I don’t know if they were intentionally lying or that it was just an honest mistake because of people not consulting with anyone who knew where these records were.”   ",2022-12-13

The exchange had an inflow of around $935 million during this period.Meanwhile, Binance has processed $6.6 billion in withdrawals on the seven days metrics. It saw $4.6 billion in inflows and has a negative netflow of $1.9 billion. Nansen noted that this was still less than the negative $2.3 billion weekly netflow Binance processed following the FTX collapse.Market makers withdraw fundsAndrew Thurman reported that two market makers, Jump Trading and Wintermute, were among the accounts that withdrew funds in the last 24 hours. Thurman said Jump withdrew over $146 million in the past week and redeemed $245 million BUSD over the past month.On the other hand, Wintermute withdrew nearly $10 million. Lookonchain reported that the market maker later sent $149.85M USDC to Binance –the last time it transferred to the exchange was 20 days ago.Meanwhile, despite these withdrawals Conor Ryder, citing Kaiko data, said there was no change in Bitcoin liquidity on Binance.Binance’s Nansen dashboard showed that its assets are worth $62.6 billion, with the majority in BUSD, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Tether.

Sterling is up by almost a fifth from the record low hit against the dollar following the mini-Budget but it is still on course for a 9pc loss this year.The move was driven by data showing that prices in the world’s largest economy climbed by 7.1pc in November compared to a year earlier.Falling costs for used cars and weaker year-on-year increases to energy prices drove the decline in the inflation rate from 7.7pc in October. Core inflation - which strips out volatile energy and food prices - edged down from 6.3pc to 6pc.Investors dumped the dollar as a faster cooling in prices increased the odds of less aggressive interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve.The Fed is expected to slow the pace of rate rises on Wednesday after backing four back-to-back 0.75 percentage point increases. Markets are betting on the Fed’s rate-setters voting for a 0.5 percentage point rise but investors are also boosting wagers on a pause in tightening early next year.James Knightley, economist at ING, said the figures will “reinforce the view that the interest rate peak is in sight” with a recession opening the door cuts in the second half of 2023.Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics, said that “mounting disinflation will soon persuade the Fed to move to the sideline after one additional 25 basis point hike in early February”.“The Fed could dismiss the better-than-expected October report as just one month’s data, but the further slowdown in November makes this new disinflationary trend much harder to ignore.”On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index leapt 2pc at the opening bell before giving up most of the gains, while global bond yields eased.Story continues06:50 PMThat's all for todayHere are the top stories so far today:1) Mick Lynch attacked the BBC because he ‘is worried that strikes won't hold’, claims Network Rail General secretary of the RMT accused Today presenter of “parroting” right-wing press2) Ofgem weighs price cap on ‘excessive’ power station profits Households feel the hit as the cost of balacing the Grid leapt to £1.5bn last winter3) Coal rail deliveries surge 77pc as Britain turns to fossil fuels Increase comes after the National Grid put the country’s coal power stations on standby4) Natural gas-only boilers face ban by 2026 Switch to hydrogen-ready models could be speeded up according to Government consultation5) FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried accused of ‘massive, years long’ conspiracy to defraud investors SEC says Bankman-Fried knowingly misrepresented stability of FTX05:54 PM'This was plain old embezzlement. Old school.'John Ray has told Congress the collapse of FTX was ""old school"" embezzlement.The new chief executive of FTX, who is handling its restructuring, told US politicians: ""This is really old fashioned embezzlement. This is taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose. Sophisticated perhaps in the way they were able to hide it from people in front of their eyes.""Plain old embezzlement. Old school.""Mr Ray, who handled the collapse of corrupt energy giant Enron, said the type of fraud was less complicated or sophisticated at FTX, although handling the collapse was more difficult due to a complete lack of record keeping.He said: ""I don't trust a single piece of paper in this organisation.""He added: ""Enron used highly orchestrated financial mechanisms by highly sophisticated people to keep transitions off balance sheets.""Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, has claimed its failure was due to mistakes rather than wrongdoing. He has been arrested in the Bahamas and charged with money-laundering, wire fraud and conspiracy in the US.John Ray, testifies before the House financial services committee - AFP05:22 PMBerenberg cuts dozens of jobs in LondonBerenberg has cut dozens of jobs in London in its second round of redundancies this year as deal activity slumps.The German investment bank laid off about 55 people on Tuesday across the investment bank, a spokesperson confirmed. Financial News first reported the cuts.“Whilst we expect to be more active in 2023, we are realistic about the speed of this recovery,” managing partner Dave Mortlock said. “As such, we have moved early to ensure our investment bank is right-sized whilst continuing to deliver top-tier service to our institutional and corporate clients.”The cuts come days after Berenberg axed around 10 roles in New York. Combined with previous rounds of redundancies, the investment bank has now halved its headcount in the US in just 12 months.It marks a rapid reversal in fortunes for the company, which reported its best ever profit in 2021.Berenberg started the year with plans to expand. Instead, the company cut 50 jobs in the US over summer and then eliminated a further 30 investment banking roles in London, or roughly 5pc of its total staff in the British capital, first revealed by The Telegraph. Staff have also been told that bonuses will be limited and targeted this year because of the much weaker activity in the IPO market.04:58 PMCompany insolvencies expected to top 2008 crisisCompany insolvencies are expected to peak at a higher level than during the last financial crisis as high inflation and energy costs hammer businesses, according to restructuring experts.FRP Advisory and Begbies Traynor said company failures started to rise after the Government withdrew pandemic support schemes and they expect further distress for British companies in the coming months.Ric Traynor, executive chairman of Begbies Traynor, said the number of company failures could trump the last peak in 2009. He said rising interest rates will make it more difficult for companies to survive a recession compared with the one triggered by the financial crisis.Begbies Traynor reported a 12pc rise in revenues for its half-year, while pre-tax profits climbed from £2.7m to £5m.Meanwhile revenues at FRP jumped 10pc to £49m during the same period, though pre-tax profits fell slightly from £5.7m to £5.4m.04:18 PMDo not believe claims that FTX failure was a 'mistake', says new chief executiveJohn J. Ray, the new chief executive of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has warned people not to believe the claims being made by its founder Sam Bankman-Fried over the company's failure.Mr Ray, who previously handled the bankruptcy of fraudulent energy giant Enron, told members of the US Congress that the implosion of FTX was like no other business failure he had ever seen.This one is unusual. Literally there is no record keeping whatsoever. There was no independent board. You had one person controlling this. That is highly unusual.FTX filed for bankruptcy amid allegations that customer funds were used to prop up risky bets at a sister hedge fund. Mr Bankman-Fried has denied wrongdoing in the collapse, but admitted he made mistakes and oversights.Ann Wagner, a member of the US Congress, asked Mr Ray: ""Is there a way to know if the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda was done by mistake"".Mr Ray replied: ""I don't find any such statements to be credible.""04:07 PMHanding overThat's all from me for today. Matthew Field will take you through the next few hours.04:07 PMElon Musk dismisses Twitter safety councilElon Musk has dismissed Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council, a group of charities and human rights organisations set up to advise the social network on removing hate speech and illegal posts.The council, which included groups such as the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the UK Safer Internet Centre, was told by email that its services were no longer required.The decision to disband the group comes as Mr Musk enacts sweeping changes at the social media company he acquired for $44bn (£35.5bn) in a self-declared mission to protect free speech.Twitter said it was “reevaluating how best to bring external insights into our product and policy development work.“As part of this process, we have decided that the Trust and Safety Council is not the best structure to do this.”03:59 PMNuclear fusion breakthrough ‘could bring limitless clean energy’US scientists announced an historic breakthrough in nuclear fusion on Tuesday that could pave the way for limitless clean energy and help the fight against climate change.Science editor Sarah Knapton has more:The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California said an experiment it conducted this month ""produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it"".The US Department of Energy described the achievement as a ""major scientific breakthrough"" that will lead to ""advancements in national defense and the future of clean power"".Dr. Kim Budil, the director of the LLNL, described it as ""one of the most significant scientific challenges ever tackled by humanity"".Read why supporters say nuclear fusion is a clean, abundant and safe source of energy.03:43 PMMick Lynch attacked the BBC because he ‘is worried that strikes won't hold’, claims Network RailAndrew Haines told the Telegraph that Mr Lynch “knows he's got to find a way to do a deal” - Heathcliff O'MalleyThe head of Network Rail has claimed Mick Lynch is lashing out because he worried that his strikes will collapse as RMT members suffer a heavy blow to their incomes over Christmas.Chief business correspondent Oliver Gill has the latest:Andrew Haines told The Telegraph that Mr Lynch, the high-profile general secretary of the RMT, ""is worried that strikes won't hold for 10 days"" and ""knows he's got to find a way to do a deal"".Mr Haines spoke after Mr Lynch attacked the BBC in a Radio 4 interview, accusing Today presenter Mishal Husain of ""parroting"" the right-wing press.Mr Haines said that the ""heightened level of aggression"" from Mr Lynch was a result of ""feeling exposed” following a vote which revealed eroding support for the strikes.Just over half of the RMT’s 18,540 eligible members rejected the offer of a 9pc pay rise from Network Rail. Previously more than 90pc backed a walkout.Read the interview with Mr Haines.03:15 PMCoal rail deliveries surge 77pc as Britain turns to fossil fuelsThe Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station is being paid by the National Grid to provide backup electricity generation this winter - Neil Hall/ShutterstockThe amount of coal transported on Britain's railways has increased by more than three quarters as the country turns to fossil fuels to keep the lights on this winter.Special correspondent Matt Oliver has the latest:Some 120m net tonne kilometres of coal were moved by rail in the three months to the end of September, an increase of 77.5pc compared to a year earlier, according to official figures.The steep rise was due to a need for extra fuel at power stations in West Burton, Lincs, and Ratcliffe, Notts, which are being paid by the National Grid to provide backup electricity generation this winter.This has led to more coal being transported on freight trains from ports including Grimsby and Immingham, Lincs, the Office for Rail and Road (ORR) said on Tuesday.It comes after the National Grid briefly put the country’s coal power stations on standby to fortify the electricity grid in the face of a cold snap.Read how the Grid was forced to rely more heavily on gas-fired plants as wind power has waned.02:51 PMUtilita customers to receive compensationMore than 25,000 customers of Utilita Energy are to receive compensation after regulator Ofgem found failings in the firm's support of vulnerable customers on pre-payment meters.The energy watchdog said Utilita had agreed to pay out £830,000, including £508,260 in compensation for affected customers and £321,740 to the Energy Redress Fund, which helps support energy consumers in vulnerable situations.Ofgem said it believed Utilita failed to take into consideration individual circumstances when deciding whether or not to provide additional support credits needed for customers topping up pre-payment meters.Affected customers, including those with medical issues and those classed as vulnerable, are set to receive £20 each in redress, which will be paid in most cases as a direct credit on their meter.02:33 PMWall Street surges as inflation easesWall Street jumped much higher at the opening bell amid optimism that the Federal Reserve will be able to ease up its tightening later this week.Inflation data for November that showed prices slowed more than expected, meaning the Fed may slow its aggressive interest rate rises.The US consumer price index increased 0.1pc from the prior month and was up 7.1pc from a year earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened the day 1.9pc higher at 34,641.86, while the broad-based S&P 500 was up 2.6pc to 4,093.31.The tech-focused Nasdaq surged 3.3pc to 11,515.29.02:06 PM'Merry Christmas Jay Powell'Like central bankers across the globe, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has been fighting to control runaway inflation in the world's largest economy.Are things finally turning around?Merry Christmas, Jay Powell pic.twitter.com/Vq5lWB3R8I— David Wessel (@davidmwessel) December 13, 202202:02 PMBreakdown of US inflation dataYou have to appreciate this emoji-laden tweet from Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, breaking down the latest US inflation statistics:🇺🇸Inflation coming down!#CPI +0.1% in November (<expected) 🟢Core CPI +0.2% 🍲Food +0.5% ⛽️Energy -1.6% (gas -2%)⤵️Goods -0.3%🚗New 0%🚘Used -2.9%👕Apparel +0.2%⬆️Services +0.3% (cooling)🏠Shelter +0.6% ⚠️Rent +0.8% ⚠️OER +0.7%🏨Hotel -0.7% 🏥Med -0.5%🛫Air -3% pic.twitter.com/7FbtjRkaEz— Gregory Daco (@GregDaco) December 13, 202201:51 PMPound jumps as inflation fell faster than expected in USUS shares and the pound jumped after inflation fell faster than expected in November, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of interest rate hikes.Economics editor Szu Ping Chan has the latest:Prices rose 7.1pc in November compared with a year earlier. This is lower than the 7.3pc expected by analysts and a drop from 7.7pc in October.US central bankers meet this week to decide whether to raise the cost of borrowing. Policymakers have already increased rates six times this year to 4pc in an effort to push down stubbornly high inflation.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy price movements, also eased back more than expected to 6pc, from a previous increase of 6.3pc.Jerome Powell, the Fed's chairman, said this month “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting."" However, he added that the central bank had a long way to go in its fight against inflation.The S&P 500 rose 3pc in pre market trading, while the pound soared past $1.24 as the dollar weakened against several currencies.01:48 PMAndrew Bailey hits back at Rishi Sunak's plans to liberate the CityThe Bank of England Governor has hit out at Rishi Sunak's plans to liberate the City by ripping up rules intended to prevent another financial crisis.Tom Rees has the latest:Andrew Bailey warned against weakening oversight of senior bankers and complacency in the wake of the financial crisis after the Treasury outlined proposals for a financial services ""Big Bang 2.0"".Last week the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt outlined a series of reforms to boost the City, including watering down ring-fencing rules for banks and reviewing the senior managers’ regime, which made bankers personally responsible for rule breaking on their watch.Speaking following the publication of the Financial Stability Report, Mr Bailey said: ""I would, however, caution that the notion we're past the financial crisis, and we therefore don't need the regulations that we had post the financial crisis, I would not go along with that view.""Because I think we have to understand clearly why the banking system is much more robust today than it was then.""Mr Bailey highlighted the senior managers' regime as a useful regulatory tool following the financial crisis. Bankers were threatened with fines or even imprisonment for infringements.He said: ""The senior managers’ regime moved us from a world where the judgement was one of culpability to a world where the judgement was one of responsibility and I think that has created an altogether helpful dynamic in that sense.""Andrew Bailey hit out at the Government's City reforms - Leon Neal/Pool Photo via AP01:28 PMBitcoin surges after Bankman-Fried chargedThe price of Bitcoin has surged 1.7pc following the arrest and subsequent fraud charges against Sam Bankman-Fried.The world's largest cryptocurrency is back about £14,200, heading towards its highest level since the collapse of the FTX exchange that rocked the digital asset world.12:56 PMFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried accused of ‘massive, years long’ conspiracy to defraud investorsSam Bankman-Fried is accused of using the FTX cryptocurrency exchange to perpetrate a $1.8bn fraud on investors and depositors.Senior technology reporter Gareth Corfield has this insight on the charges:The FTX exchange accepted real currency, known to cryptocurrency enthusiasts as ""fiat"" money, and swapped it for one of the digital tokens it traded.Prosecutors say Mr Bankman-Fried deliberately mixed FTX's funds with those of his personal hedge fund, Alameda Research.Using depositors' monies paid to FTX, he is alleged to have loaned hundreds of millions of pounds to Alameda. At his direction, Alameda then used FTX depositors' money to speculate on the cryptocurrency markets, the indictment says.In public appearances over the last month Mr Bankman-Fried has denied committing fraud, saying the only thing he did wrong was failing to install proper corporate controls at his companies.Prosecutors want him banned from running any cryptocurrency exchange in future, as well as repaying all the monies he allegedly deceived investors into giving him.Read on for details.12:45 PMLandlords facing £4,000 surge in mortgage costs next year, warns Bank of EnglandThe Bank of England has warned that landlords face a near £4,000 jump in mortgage costs next year as it pushes up interest rates to stamp out inflation.Senior economics reporter Tom Rees has the details:The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee said that by the end of 2023, monthly repayments for buy-to-let landlords will rise by £175 and by more than £300 for a fifth.It warned tenants that landlords are likely to pass on the higher costs, with rents forecast to increase by around 20pc. The report said: ""This would increase the cost of housing for renters, which may affect their resilience.""The Bank also warned households will have to pay £250 extra a month in mortgage costs next year as more than 4m face higher rates.It said that half of mortgages held by owner occupiers will be exposed to surging interest rates over the next year but banks are expected to provide extra help to struggling families.Read how average monthly mortgage cost will jump.12:06 PMCity still needs some regulation, insists BaileyAndrew Bailey harked back to the ""very painful"" period after the 2008 global crisis as he answered questions about the Chancellor's biggest loosening of financial rules in a generation.The Governor of the Bank of England indicated that he believes the UK banking sector still needs some post-financial crisis regulations after a raft of reforms were announced by Jeremy Hunt last week.The Chancellor laid out more than 30 regulatory changes - which he dubbed the ""Edinburgh reforms"" - which he claimed will ""turbocharge"" growth in towns and cities across the UK. Andrew Bailey said:Always regulation has to be kept up to date, and if you didn't that would be a road to problems.I would say, it is important to recognise that the regulatory initiatives after the financial crisis were done for an important reason. It was very painful.Accepting there are reasons why we review thing, the notion that we are past the financial crisis and don't need the regulations we had past the financial crisis, is a view I would not go along with.We have to understand why the banking system is much more robust today that it was then.Andrew Bailey holds a press conference on Britain's financial stability - Leon Neal/PA Wire11:45 AMFTX 'operated behind a veneer of legitimacy'FTX, launched in 2019 and based in the Bahamas, filed for bankruptcy Nov 11 after it struggled to raise money to stave off collapse as traders rushed to withdraw $6bn (£4.8bn) from the platform in three days.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged Sam Bankman-Fried was responsible for ""fraudulently raising billions"".Gurbir S Grewal, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said:FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr Bankman-Fried created by, among other things, touting its best-in-class controls, including a proprietary 'risk engine,' and FTX's adherence to specific investor protection principles and detailed terms of service.But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.FTX’s collapse highlights the very real risks that unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose for investors and customers alike.While we continue to investigate FTX and other entities and individuals for potential violations of the federal securities laws, as alleged in our complaint, today we are holding Mr Bankman-Fried responsible for fraudulently raising billions of dollars from investors in FTX and misusing funds belonging to FTX’s trading customers.11:36 AMBankman-Fried charges show crypto platforms must comply with laws, warns SECSEC chairman Gary Gensler said issued a warning to crypto platforms as details of the fraud charges against Sam Bankman-Fried were made public. He said:We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto.The alleged fraud committed by Mr Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.Compliance protects both those who invest on and those who invest in crypto platforms with time-tested safeguards, such as properly protecting customer funds and separating conflicting lines of business.It also shines a light into trading platform conduct for both investors through disclosure and regulators through examination authority.To those platforms that don't comply with our securities laws, the SEC's Enforcement Division is ready to take action.11:33 AMSam Bankman-Fried charged with defrauding equity investors in FTXSam Bankman-Fried has been charged with trying to defraud investors in his FTX crypto exchange.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today revealed the details of its indictment against the disgraced entrepreneur.The collapse of his FTX exchange left more than a million creditors out of pocket, including 80,000 in the UK.The SEC alleges Mr Bankman-Fried orchestrated a years-long fraud to conceal from FTX's investors that he was using customers' funds for his privately-held crypto hedge fund to Alameda Research.Since at least May 2019, FTX, based in The Bahamas, raised more than $1.8bn from equity investors, including approximately $1.1bn (£1.5bn) from approximately 90 US-based investors.FTX founder Samuel Bankman-Fried - SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images11:25 AMBailey: Households and businesses more financially resilientAndrew Bailey is holding a press conference after the Bank of England released its latest assessment of Britain's financial stability.The Governor said the ""economic environment is challenging"" but stressed that households are better placed to deal with this than during the 2008 financial crisis. He said:We have high inflation, demand is slowing and interest rates have been rising.Household and business finances are under greater strain.Overall however, both households and businesses are more financially resilient than they were in previous periods of stress.Andrew Bailey holds a press conference - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg11:20 AMPoundland to open 550 stores as demand growsPoundland owner Pepco is to accelerate its store expansion plans after it saw a ""strong"" start to the new financial year.The company, which also owns the Dealz chain in Ireland and continental Europe, said it has seen growing demand from new and returning customers facing pressure on their household budgets.It told shareholders it expects revenue growth to continue in the ""mid to high teens"" as a result of higher like-for-like sales and the store investment plan.Pepco said it plans to open around 550 stores in the current financial year, driven by growth in central and eastern Europe.The firm had 516 net new store openings over the previous year, excluding the closure of 59 Fultons Foods shops.Pepco revealed that revenues increased by 17.4pc to €4.8bn (£4.1bn) in the year to September 30, compared with the same period last year.Poundland - REUTERS/Phil Noble11:02 AMHousehold spending on mortgage payments to rise a share of incomeThis chart from the Bank of England shows how rising mortgage spending may not hit as hard as previous financial crises.Household spending on mortgage payments as a share of their income is expected to rise, but it will remain below previous peaks after the global financial crisis and the 1990s recession:Household spending on mortgage payments as a share of their income is expected to rise, but remain below previous peaks. https://t.co/Fh0PwYXgkO #FinancialStabilityReport pic.twitter.com/MGjioYgslG— Bank of England (@bankofengland) December 13, 202210:43 AMBank of England unveils plan to avoid future pension fund crunchThe Bank of England has ordered the pensions regulator to outline new buffers for the liability-driven investment (LDIs) funds that ran into trouble when the mini-Budget triggered a £70bn scramble for cash.Senior economics reporter Tom Rees as the latest analysis:The Pensions Regulator has been told to introduce rules to ensure the strategy used by pension schemes can withstand another surge in interest rates after swathes came close to collapse during the mini-Budget market chaos.The Bank estimated in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report that the wave of collateral calls faced by LDI funds and pension schemes surged to more than £70bn during the crisis. This created a vicious spiral that forced the Bank into a multi-billion pound bond-buying intervention in late September.Its Financial Policy Committee warned that the buffers held by LDI funds were ""too low and less usable in practice than expected"".Threadneedle Street also announced it will become the first central bank to conduct stress tests on the non-bank sector after problems at LDI funds became just the latest vulnerability to be exposed.10:40 AMFour million mortgages to increase in next yearThe Bank of England has released its twice-yearly assessment of Britain's financial stability, which has been brought into sharper focus in light of the cost-of-living crisis.Monthly payments on around 4m owner-occupied mortgages are expected to increase over the next year.However, although the proportion of disposable income spent on mortgage payments in aggregate is projected to rise, it is expected to remain below the peak levels during the global financial crisis and the 1990s recession.It also said the UK banking system is resilient to the current economic outlook and has capacity to support lending, even if economic conditions are worse than forecast.10:35 AMOil prices rise as pipeline remains shutOil has risen for a second day on signs of further easing of China's Covid-19 restrictions and as a key North American pipeline remained shut.Brent crude, the international benchmark, is up 1.4pc to more than $79 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) climbed near $74 a barrel after closing 3pc higher on Monday, the first gain in seven sessions. CChina's ambassador to the US said the nation will continue relaxing its pandemic curbs and will welcome more international travelers soon, lifting demand prospects in the world's top oil importer.Meanwhile, TC Energy has yet to submit a restart plan needed to resume operation of the Keystone pipeline following an oil spill.The conduit has now leaked more crude than any other pipeline on US land in the past 12 years.10:13 AMApple launches satellite emergency system to let iPhone users contact 999 without signalApple has launched a new satellite SOS system for iPhone users in the UK so people can ask for help from 999 responders even when there is no mobile reception.Senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the details:The US tech giant said its Emergency SOS via satellite service, which is available for its iPhone 14 smartphones, went live in the UK this morning.The technology connects customers to a passing satellite so they can send out a distress beacon, telling responders if they are lost or injured, even if they have no other signal from terrestrial phone or data networks.If an iPhone user finds themselves in an emergency with no signal, dialling 999 will prompt them to try and connect to a satellite. The iPhone then sends a text message, which is picked up by a safety team employed by Apple.Read how it will work.09:47 AMMarkets bet interest rates to peak at 4.75pcMoney markets have raised bets on the Bank of England's forthcoming increases in interest rates.Traders are pricing the bank rate to climb to 4.75pc by August. It is the first time that has been the case since Nov 28.Data from the Office for National Statistics today showed UK wages jumped at the strongest pace on record outside of the pandemic.Traders have priced in 57 basis points of increases on Thursday when policymakers announce their decision.Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""This is the second data release in two days that might increase the chances of the MPC repeating November's 75bps interest rate hike on Thursday, instead of delivering the smaller 50bps rise that we and most others are expecting.""09:37 AMBinance halts withdrawals of major USDC stablecoinBinance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, said it has ""temporarily paused"" withdrawals of the major stablecoin USDC.The company's chief executive Changpeng Zhao tweeted: ""On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals.""Swapping USDC Coin with two other crypto tokens - Paxos Standard and Binance USD - requires using traditional dollars at a bank in New York, Zhao added.He said: ""The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open.""The swaps are ""1:1 conversions, no margin or leverage involved. We will also try to establish more fluid swap channels in the future,"" he added.Binance said in a separate tweet the halt was due to ""token swap"" - where digital token holders exchange their crypto coins, typically over different blockchains.On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals. However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD. The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open. 1/2— CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 202209:01 AMMarkets flat as British American Tobacco hit by Supreme CourtThe FTSE 100 was muted in early trading as gains in energy stocks were offset by weakness in consumer staples, dragged down by a decline in British American Tobacco.The blue-chip index and the mid-cap FTSE 250 were both flat.British American Tobacco dropped 0.9pc after the US Supreme Court denied an emergency request to put on hold the ban on selling all flavoured tobacco products in California.The FTSE 350 Food, Beverage and Tobacco index lost 0.7pc.However, energy stocks climbed 1.1pc as supply challenges in the US bumped up crude prices.Holiday Inn owner IHG rose 0.2pc on promoting Michael Glover, to the role of chief financial officer starting March 2023, succeeding Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson.08:43 AMRoyal Navy contract boosts CapitaOutsourcing giant Capita has seen its revenues lifted by its contract with the Royal Navy, with debts slimmed as it shed an area of the business.The firm reported 2pc adjusted group revenue growth in the 11 months to November 30 in its pre-close trading update to investors.This was helped by its public services arm, which includes a training contract with the Royal Navy as well as revenue growth across its justice, central government and transport arms.Capita secured a three-year extension to its contract with the NHS England's Primary Care Support England (PCSE), worth £94m, and a two-year contract for IT and back office services for Barnet Council in north-west London, worth up to £57m, it said.It also secured several big new clients, including Scottish Power, Irish Water and Trade Republic, plus a £35m renewed contract with a UK high street retailer.08:22 AMLynch: Still plenty of time for deal before Christmas Eve strikesRail workers have begun a series of strikes designed to cripple Britain's transport system over the Christmas period.Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) general secretary Mick Lynch insisted his members still have the support of the public and said it is the Government which is contributing to the ""spoiling of the people's Christmas"".He told Good Morning Britain:I have no intention of spoiling people's Christmas. The Government is contributing to that spoiling of the people's Christmas because they've brought these strikes on by stopping the companies from making suitable proposals.That's the position that we're in and we'll have to keep this dispute going until we get a reasonable settlement and a reasonable set of proposals that our members want to accept.We've still got plenty of time before the Christmas Eve strikes if (Network Rail chief executive) Andrew Haines and the train operating companies, Huw Merriman the rail minister, and Mark Harper the Secretary of State, want to come to me with a set of serious proposals to improve their offer so that we can get a settlement to the dispute, we'll come over and see them as soon as possible.They've already invited me to a set of talks and we'll attend those to try and get a settlement to this dispute. And when our members decide that they want to accept it, that's when the dispute will be finished.RMT general secretary Mick Lynch - REUTERS/Toby Melville08:09 AMFTSE 100 opens lowerStock markets in London have lost a little ground after figures showing the historic scale of the days lost to strike action this year.The FTSE 100 is down 0.1pc to 7,441.20 and the FTSE 250 is also down 0.1pc to 18,806.13.07:40 AMEarly retirees forced to seek work again because of cost of livingEarly retirees are being forced to seek work again as the cost of living crisis deepens, new data show.The number of people on payrolls increased by 107,000 to a new record 29.9m in November, according to latest figures.Meanwhile, Britain’s inactivity rate - meaning the share of people neither working nor looking for a job - fell by 0.2 percentage points to 21.5pc in the three months to October.The drop was driven by a fall in working-age people considering themselves to be retired, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""This tallies with other data which suggest more people in their 50s are thinking of going back to work, at a time when the cost of living is rising rapidly.""With more people re-engaging with the labour market, there were more in employment and also more who were actively looking for a job.""The figures also showed that the number of people with second jobs increased slightly by 43,000 to 1.3m.The UK is almost unique among rich advanced economies in having a smaller labour force than before the pandemic.Economists say this is one of the reasons why the recession is expected to hit the UK harder than other similar countries.Wages in Britain are rising faster than at almost any time in at least two decades, maintaining pressure on the Bank of England to keep hiking interest rates despite a worsening economic outlook.The finance and the business services sector had the largest increase in wages, up 7pc, followed by wholesale, retail and hospitality.The figures also showed a wide gap between the pay increases private-sector workers earn and what is going to those in public services.Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 6.9pc in the quarter through October, and 2.7pc for the public sector.Iutside of the height of the pandemic period, this is the largest growth rate seen for the private sector and is among the largest differences between the private sector and public sector growth rates seen by the Office for National Statistics.The historic difference is likely to fuel the demands of nurses and border force staff who are going on strike this month as inflation hit a 41-year high of 11.1pc in October.After taking inflation into account, average pay fell by 2.7% in the year to August to October 2022, both including and excluding bonuses.➡️ https://t.co/Mm5HeBtEv7 pic.twitter.com/MVFCs32mbn— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) December 13, 202207:33 AMWages growing at fastest rate since 2001, barring pandemicWages in Britain are rising faster than at almost any time in at least two decades, maintaining pressure on the Bank of England to keep hiking interest rates despite a worsening economic outlook.Official figures show average earnings excluding bonuses were 6.1pc higher in the three months through October than a year earlier. That is the most since records began in 2001, barring the height of the pandemic.The jump reflects labour shortages that remain chronic despite a cost-of-living crisis that is set to tip the UK into long recession, if it has not already done so.Those shortages are being made worse by the loss of hundreds of thousands of workers over the last two years. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said:Twelve years of Conservative failure on the economy has left working people with falling wages, employment lower than pre-pandemic and record numbers of people out of work for reasons of ill-health - costing billions more in benefit payments.Instead of turning their backs on people who want help to find a job, Labour would get Britain working again and target the highest employment in the G7 by shifting resources to local communities.A Labour government will get our economy firing on all cylinders with our green prosperity plan and an active partnership with business.07:25 AMFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in the BahamasUndoubtedly the story from overnight was the arrest of former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas.The arrest, confirmed by the US Attorney's office in Manhattan, marks a stunning fall from grace for the 30-year-old entrepreneur, who rode a boom in bitcoin and other digital assets to become a billionaire many times over until FTX's rapid demise.The exchange, launched in 2019 and based in the Bahamas, filed for bankruptcy Nov 11 after it struggled to raise money to stave off collapse as traders rushed to withdraw $6bn (£4.8bn) from the platform in three days.Some 8pc of FTX's users were based in the UK, a Delaware court heard, suggesting that 80,000 Britons may have lost money. FTX left around one million creditors, the vast majority of whom were unsecured users of the exchange.His arrest comes as he was due to appear before a Congressional committee today.Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas - SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images07:20 AMHunt reacts to jobs numbersJeremy Hunt said the jobs figures do not take away from his mission to get inflation down from its runaway levels. The Chancellor said:While unemployment in the UK remains close to historic lows, high inflation continues to plague economies around the world as we manage the impacts of Covid-19 and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.To get the British economy back on track, we have a plan which will help to more than halve inflation next year - but that requires some difficult decisions now. Any action that risks embedding high prices into our economy will only prolong the pain for everyone, and stunt any prospect of long-term economic growth.With job vacancies at near record highs, we are committed to helping people back into work, and helping those in employment to raise their incomes, progress in work, and become financially independent.07:18 AMStrikes blamed for highest level of working days lost since 1990Britain has lost its highest number of working days to strike action since 1990 as employers brace for more misery caused by walkouts over the Christmas and New Year period.There have been 1.2m days lost to strike action since June, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics, which is the highest number for a five month period since May 1990.There were 417,000 working days lost because of industrial action in October, which is the highest since November 2011.Employers are braced for their busiest time of the year during Christmas and New Year to be brutally affected by industrial action on the trains, having already dealt with the first national rail strike in 25 years over the summer.Today, rail workers at the RMT begin four weeks of industrial action that will cause chaos for commuters and misery for people with Christmas travel plans.Meanwhile, a wave of industrial action involving postal workers, nurses, paramedics and Border Force staff this month is expected to cause mass disruption, with thousands of NHS operations and appointments cancelled.Figures out today reveal Britain's labour market has shown remarkable resilience even as data this week showed the economy continued to contract in the three months to October.The number of people on payrolls increased by 107,000 to a new record 29.9m in November.Meanwhile, the number of people out of work in the three months to October increased by 23,000 to 1.25m. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.7pc.Unemployment in the UK remains close to historic lows, and remains lower than the Republic of Ireland (4.4pc), Canada (5.1pc), the Euro area (6.5pc), France (7.1pc), Sweden (7.7pc), Italy (7.8pc) and Spain (12.5pc).The number of employees on the payroll continued to grow in November and is now 932,000 above its pre- pandemic level.Headline indicators for the UK labour market for August to October 2022 show that:▪️ employment was 75.6%▪️ unemployment was 3.7%▪️ economic inactivity was 21.5%➡️ https://t.co/wG3oDW7cjw pic.twitter.com/uMYXB2sGyi— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) December 13, 202207:13 AMGood morningThere were 417,000 working days lost because of strikes in October, which is the highest since November 2011.It comes as data from the Office for National Statistics show Britain's employment rate for the three months to October increased by 0.2 percentage points to 75.6pc but is still below pre-pandemic levels.The number of payrolled employees for November showed another monthly increase, up 107,000 on the revised October figures, to a record 29.9m.The rate of UK unemployment rose to 3.7pc in the three months to October, up from 3.6pc in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said.5 things to start your day1) FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in the Bahamas | The arrest of the former darling of the crypto industry comes a day before he was due to testify before a Congressional committee2) Electric car demand falls for first time since pandemic as electricity prices soar | Interest wanes amid falling petrol prices fall and surging energy bills3)  Struggling factories prepare for hibernation as power costs soar | Subzero temperatures herald a winter of shutdowns that could do lasting damage4)  Cold snap fuels 70pc jump in sales of electric blankets | Sub-zero temperatures force households to find cheaper ways to stay warm5) Thousands of RMT members rebel against Mick Lynch on 9pc pay offer | 36.4pc of balloted trade union members voted to end rail strikes that are causing chaosWhat happened overnightAsian stock markets rose following overnight optimism on Wall Street that the US Federal Reserve and other central banks would ease off on the pace at which interest rates have been hiked to tackle the highest inflation levels in decades.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.17pc, while Japan's Nikkei and Seoul's KOSPI index gained 0.32pc and 0.01pc.

Now, with Sam Bankman-Fried arrested on Monday by Bahamian authorities, the world is wondering if the FTX founder will follow in Holmes' footsteps as the next disgraced startup founder to end up behind bars.These fallen founders, and others like them — from WeWork's Adam Neumann to Uber's Travis Kalanick — have something in common, and it's not just the prestige television shows being made about their collapses.They're what happens when an enigmatic, passionate founder spins an impressive story about their startup — only for everything to later fall apart in a mess of exaggeration, deception and in some cases, allegations of outright fraud.Were they simply masterful deceivers? Or, were there signs that might have pointed toward their deceptions and exaggerations sooner?The answer is the latter, says Pamela Meyer, a Harvard-educated deception expert who is a certified fraud examiner and the author of the 2010 book ""Liespotting: Proven Techniques to Detect Deception."" It takes several critical ""thinking errors"" to be fooled by potential fraudsters, Meyer tells CNBC Make It.Those errors are easy to make. We often trust people offering ""something we desperately want,"" like a potentially life-saving medical device or a way to get rich quick through cryptocurrency, she says. It's easy to be blinded by traditional signs of legitimacy, like an elite education, Meyer adds. Holmes attended Stanford before dropping out to launch Theranos. Bankman-Fried's parents were both Stanford law professors, and he graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).And there's an element of mob mentality: If people around you say someone is trustworthy, you're more inclined to trust them. It's far too easy to ""unconsciously conflate familiarity with legitimacy,"" Meyer says.Here are Meyer's ""four key verbal indicators of deceit"" that anyone can spot, whether you're talking to someone face-to-face or watching a public figure give an interview:Protest statementsBe wary of anyone who falls back on a lot of ""protest statements,"" Meyer says.""Imagine someone across the table from you has put their hand up in the 'stop' position and says, 'But that's the wrong question to ask. Let me tell you why,'"" she says.It's a form of deception, and an indication that the person is trying to avoid a confrontational question — rather than responding with evidence that could clear things up and assuage your concerns about their truthfulness.""When someone protests, take note,"" Meyer says.Minimizing languageFraudsters sometimes ward off probing questions by using ""minimizing language,"" to downplay any concerns, Meyer says.Bankman-Fried, for example, has blamed his own inexperience as a founder and businessman for FTX's downfall — while denying that he actually, purposefully defrauded any customers or investors.As for the $8 billion in customer funds that remain missing, Bankman-Fried blamed the issue on ""a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts"" in a Twitter thread apology he posted in November. Bankman-Fried said he was ""shocked"" by what happened at FTX, while denying again that he committed any fraud, in an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times' DealBook Summit last month. He appeared to deflect some blame toward Alameda Research, the crypto hedge fund he co-founded.Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.""When minimizing is clustered with protesting and deflecting, you've got a sign to dig deeper,"" Meyer says.DeflectionPeople who repeatedly change the subject when asked difficult questions raise an obvious red flag, Meyer says. But expert fraudsters can do this so well that you might not notice.Holmes often deflected difficult technical questions about Theranos' hardware by telling stories about her great-great-grandfather, a surgeon who had a hospital named after him, Meyer says.Or, Holmes would talk about her uncle who died of cancer, Meyer adds — and how he inspired Holmes' devotion for more easily testing people for deadly diseases.Meyer also notes that Bankman-Fried often uses financial jargon in his interviews, which she calls ""a deflection tactic.""And when first pitching FTX to investors, Bankman-Fried would reportedly play video games during pitch meetings, while insisting that the investors give him complete control. The New York Times described those meetings as ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offers.Such tactics should have been ""a red flag, for sure, that he was deflecting a deep dive into the details"" of FTX, Meyer says. ""Deflection can be verbal, but it can also be wag-the-dog tactical.""Convincing behavior Take note when people suddenly switch from being cooperative and forthcoming ""to 'convince mode,' where they shift to a pleading, persuasive tone,"" Meyer says. ""What do you do, when someone shifts to this mode? You let them talk and talk and talk.""This appears to be Bankman-Fried's current mode, Meyer says.The FTX founder has participated in numerous recent interviews, attempting to convince the public that he didn't intentionally mislead anyone, and that the downfall of his company was simply a result of poor oversight and honest mistakes.But it's hard to trust those statements, Meyer says. After all, Bankman-Fried has admitted to very recently lying about several aspects of his life — including his devotion to effective altruism, political donation history and veganism.""Most people exhibit patterns of deceit. Where there is smoke, there is usually fire,"" says Meyer. ""When you interrogate someone and artfully ask, 'Is there anything else?' several times after they have claimed to come clean, it is remarkable how much else they come forth with.""Register for the CNBC Small Business Playbook virtual summit on December 14th.

Crypto platforms that are seeking registration will need to sign an undertaking to adhere to investor protections before they fall under formal regulatory surveillance. This move follows the enormous fall of the global cryptocurrency platform FTX. This is among the new guidelines that have been set by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), which is an umbrella body for securities regulators in the Canadian region. According to the Canadian Securities Administrators, crypto oversight has been strengthened. The CSA said: Following recent events in the crypto market, the CSA is strengthening its approach to oversight of crypto trading platforms by expanding existing requirements for platforms operating in Canada. The CSA is a body that comprises securities regulators from 10 different provinces and three territories in Canada. From now on, the CSA aims at expanding the current requirements for crypto platforms that are presently operating within the country. Not only will the regulatory grip within the country be tightened, but licensing will also be tightened, including firms based outside the country but still accessible to Canadian citizens.

These platforms will not be allowed to offer margin or leverage for Canadian clients in particular. In case the pre-registration undertaking is not offered by the principal regulator within a deadline to be determined or if the platform has not shut all its operations in Canada, then, “all applicable regulatory options to bring the platform into compliance with securities law, including enforcement action, will be considered,” as stated by the CSA. Preliminary Plans To Tighten Oversight On Crypto Were Announced Earlier The CSA was formed to harmonise and coordinate regulation among a slew of regional watchdogs scattered across Canada. It had announced certain preliminary plans that strived to improve the oversight of crypto operators in Canada sometime in mid-August, 2022.  Bitcoin was priced at $17,500 on the one-day chart | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView  This happened right before the collapse of FTX in November. In that announcement, the CSA mentioned that it was hoping that unregistered crypto platforms in Canada would undergo a pre-registration undertaking (PRU) while the application was on its way to approval.Related Reading: UK’s Crypto Industry Under Tighter Scrutiny After New Regulation Plan The CSA additionally stated: Canadian investors are urged to exercise caution and consider seeking advice from a registered investment advisor before investing in crypto. The watchdog further remarked that it considers stablecoins “securities and/or derivatives,” which are also prohibited. Canadian traders shall not be allowed to trade or even be exposed to such crypto assets on either registered or pre-registered platforms.   ",2022-12-13

The exchange has been under a money laundering investigation since 2018. Today’s news are not limited to developments around Binance as FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was charged with fraud. Bankman-Fried is accused of misappropriating deposits of FTX clients to pay for expenses of his crypto fund Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday evening. He may be extradited to the U.S., which looks like the most likely outcome. It is not clear whether Bankman-Fried will fight extradition.

US Attorney Damian Williams in New York said Bankman-Fried made illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans with “stolen customer money”, and that it was part of one of the “biggest financial frauds in American history”. “While this is our first public announcement, it will not be our last,” he said, adding Bankman-Fried “made tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions”. Bankman-Fried faces a maximum sentence of 115 years in prison if convicted on all eight counts, prosecutors said, though any sentence would depend on a range of factors. Williams declined to say whether prosecutors would bring any charges against other FTX executives and whether any FTX insiders were cooperating with the investigation. The 30-year-old Bankman-Fried arrived at a heavily guarded Bahamas court on Tuesday for his first in-person public appearance since the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse. He could be extradited to the US and he told the court he could fight the extradition. Bahamian prosecutors have asked that Bankman-Fried be denied bail if he fights extradition. “Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” his lawyer, Mark S Cohen, said in an earlier statement. Scheme to defraud In the indictment, prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX’s customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for expenses and debts and to make investments on behalf of his cryptocurrency hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC. He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing them with false and misleading information about the hedge fund’s condition and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said. “We allege that the defendant conspired to defraud customers by misappropriating their deposits; to defraud lenders; to commit securities fraud and money laundering; and to violate campaign finance laws,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Both the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged Bankman-Fried committed fraud in lawsuits filed on Tuesday. “While he spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments, Bankman-Fried’s house of cards began to crumble,” the SEC filing said. The CFTC sued Bankman-Fried, Alameda and FTX on Tuesday, alleging fraud involving digital commodity assets. Since at least May 2019, FTX raised more than $1.8bn from equity investors in a years-long “brazen, multi-year scheme” in which Bankman-Fried concealed that FTX was diverting customer funds to its affiliated cryptocurrency hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC, the SEC alleged. While the public believed Bankman-Fried’s “lies” and sent billions of dollars to FTX, he improperly diverted customer funds to his hedge fund, the SEC said in a court filing. He continued to divert FTX customer funds even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, the SEC said. Bankman-Fried has apologised to customers and acknowledged oversight failings at FTX but said he does not personally think he has any criminal liability. Crypto investors lost billions Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 and rode a cryptocurrency boom to build it into one of the world’s largest exchanges of the digital tokens. Forbes pegged his net worth a year ago at $26.5bn and he became a substantial donor to US political campaigns, media outlets and other causes. A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform on which investors can trade digital tokens such as Bitcoin. As legal challenges mount, the US Congress is also looking at crafting legislation to rein in a loosely-regulated industry. FTX has shared findings with the SEC and US prosecutors and is investigating whether Bankman-Fried’s parents were involved in the operation. FTX’s collapse was one of a series of bankruptcies in the crypto industry this year as digital asset markets tumbled from 2021 peaks. FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, leaving an estimated one million customers and other investors facing losses in the billions of dollars. The collapse reverberated across the cryptocurrency world and sent Bitcoin and other digital assets plummeting. A spokesperson for FTX Debtors declined to comment. Known in financial circles by his initials, SBF, Bankman-Fried was a prominent and unconventional figure. He sported wild hair, T-shirts and shorts on panel appearances with statesmen like former US President Bill Clinton and former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair. Bankman-Fried became one of the largest Democratic donors in the United States, contributing $5.2m to President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. FTX’s liquidity crunch came after Bankman-Fried secretly used $10bn in customer funds to support his proprietary trading firm, Alameda Research, Reuters has reported. At least $1bn in customer funds had vanished. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX’s chief executive officer the same day as the bankruptcy filing. Unlike other customers, Alameda was allowed to hold a negative account on FTX’s platform, the SEC said. Bankman-Fried directed code to be written that allowed this, the agency said. ",2022-12-13

Bankman-Fried wrote: I fucked up. I know that it doesn’t mean much to say that I’m sorry. And so I’m dedicating as much of myself as I can to doing right by customers. When all is said and done, I’ll judge myself primarily by one metric: whether I have eventually been able to make customers whole. If I fail our customers in this regard, I have failed myself. Now that he apologized, Bankman-Fried proceeded to lament the loss of his billions of dollars, which is reportedly built on fraud and other financial crimes, and whined he and other senior members of FTX cannot still access personal information as many people have lost unknown amounts of money on FTX:   Last year, my net worth was valued at $20b. Today, I would be wrong to say that I have nothing: I have a loving family, and food on my plate, and that’s more than life has given billions of people. But last I saw, I believe my bank account had about $100k in it. I don’t know for sure, because I have been denied access to many of my own personal passwords, data, documents, and accounts. As of today, I and many other members of FTX International’s former management team are missing access to key data–data that could help inform customers, inform the Chapter 11 team’s decisions, and inform foreign regulators looking after FTX International. Nearly all of this data is held by the Chapter 11 team. The former FTX CEO then complained current FTX CEO John Ray, who is managing the bankruptcy of FTX, for not working with him. He wrote, “I have sent five emails to Mr. Ray. Mr. Ray has never responded, nor has he reached out to me to communicate in any other ways.” Bankman-Fried also took issue with the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and other executives for pushing the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which he believes was a mistake.

(Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg via Getty) He then complained the company had sustained “a month of sustained negative PR on FTX largely driven by Binance,” a rival digital currency exchange. He also said a “run on the bank” was “triggered” by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Zhao said Binance would sell large holdings of the FTT token, a cryptocurrency token largely held by FTX. After blaming Binance as one of the main catalysts for the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried said, “There is much more to say about Binance, its role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and its relationship with FTX, but this is neither the place nor the time for it.” Ray, in contrast, blamed the collapse of FTX principally on “grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement any controls.

John Ray III called FTX’s collapse one of the worst business failures he has seen — a “paperless bankruptcy,” fueled by an “unprecedented lack of documentation.” Notably absent from the hearing before the House Financial Services Committee is FTX’s founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested in the Bahamas just hours before he was scheduled to testify. The arrest was made at the request of the U.S. government, which on Tuesday announced criminal charges against Bankman-Fried including wire fraud and money laundering. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, when the firm ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run. The collapse of crypto’s second-largest exchange has garnered worldwide attention, and prompted worries in the crypto industry that the pain could become widespread. Estimates are that FTX customers could wind up losing billions of dollars. Ray, who took over FTX on Nov. 11, told the committee that the problems at FTX were a cumulation of months or even years of bad decisions and poor financial controls. “This is not something that happened overnight or in a context of a week,” he said. Ray, a long-time corporate restructuring expert, said the situation at FTX was worse that what he found at Enron two decades ago. Enron was one of the biggest corporate frauds in U.S. history. When asked to elaborate by Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., Ray said, “Literally, there’s no record-keeping whatsoever,” eliciting laughter from the room. Ray also said employees used QuickBooks, software typically used by small and medium-sized businesses, to manage FTX’s finances. “A multibillion-dollar company using QuickBooks,” Ray said. At its peak, FTX’s market value topped $30 billion. In his prepared remarks, Ray painted a picture of a company acting with little to no oversight. “FTX Group’s collapse appears to stem from the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people’s money or assets,” Ray said. In interviews since FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that the company lacked proper financial controls and corporate governance, but denied any fraud had been committed. U.S. prosecutors and financial regulators disagreed with that assessment. An indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Bankman-Fried with a host of financial crimes and campaign finance violations, alleging he played a central role in the rapid collapse of FTX and hid its problems from the public and investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Bankman-Fried illegally used investors’ money to buy real estate on behalf of himself and family. Ray’s comments supported those allegations. “This is just old fashion embezzlement, taking money from others and using it for your own purposes,” he said. “This is not sophisticated at all.” A lawyer for Bankman-Fried, Mark S. Cohen, said Tuesday he is “reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.” __ Reporter Ken Sweet contributed.Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter examines how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today's executives.

A magistrate judge in the Bahamas denied bail for the 30-year-old accused crypto crook, who lowered his head and hugged his parents, both Stanford professors, following the decision. It came after a lengthy hearing — Bankman-Fried’s first in-person public appearance since his arrest in the Bahamas on Monday and the stunning collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange. Wearing a blue suit and white shirt at a heavily guarded court in the capital, Nassau, Bankman-Fried quickly signaled he would not waive an extradition hearing on being sent back to the US — where he faces a slew of federal charges, including fraud and making illegal campaign contributions. “Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” his lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, also said in a statement. Chief magistrate Joyann Ferguson-Pratt granted Bankman-Fried’s request to take his medication before the hearing began, according to Coindesk.   4  Sam Bankman-Fried is escorted out of the Magistrate Court building in Nassau, Bahamas after his arrest.REUTERS   4  Sam Bankman-Fried is fighting his extradition to the U.S.REUTERS Asked if he needed a drink to take them, Bankman-Fried — who is known to take anti-depression meds via an adhesive patch — reportedly replied, “I don’t need water but I do need to take my shirt off to take them.” His mother laughed out loud when her son was referred to as a “fugitive,” the report said. The hearing, which started at 10:30 a.m., was delayed several times, including over legal discussion on whether the well-connected Democratic donor could get bail, Eyewitness News Bahamas said.  Prosecutors maintained that the mogul once estimated to be worth $32 billion posed a clear flight risk, the local outlet said. Bankman-Fried’s lawyer Jerome Roberts offered up the cash bail and for his client — who has already surrendered his passport — to wear an ankle bracelet in exchange for his release, Bloomberg reported.  Ferguson-Pratt said she needed time to consider the arguments because “rushed justice is no justice at all,” and later issued her decision, remanding Bankman-Fried into custody until a Feb. 8, 2023, court date.   4  His parents were among those spotted arriving at the court Tuesday.REUTERS Legal experts say Bankman-Fried faces long odds to avoid getting returned to the US, and Bahamian Attorney General Ryan Pinder had vowed to “promptly” extradite him to stand charges. He faces up to 115 years in prison if convicted of eight charges, including wire fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations for his big-money political donations. He also faces separate charges from the SEC. The hearing started some 17 hours after Bankman-Fried was busted at his exclusive resort on the island late Monday.   4  He was brought to court in a convoy that included SWAT vehicles.REUTERS The fallen moneyman was supported by his parents, Stanford Law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, at the court, which was circled by a ring of heavily armed police. Bankman-Fried was smuggled into the court through a side door to avoid reporters who’d been assured he would be entering with others arriving from police HQ, Eyewitness News Bahamas said. Instead, he was brought in a separate convoy with heavily armed SWAT officers, who remained on guard circling the building — and even inside up to the entrance to court No. 9, the local station said.  Even the magistrate hearing the case, Ferguson-Pratt, struggled to get in — complaining that she “had never seen such madness” at the court, the station said. US authorities also said they will try to claw back any of Bankman-Fried’s financial gains from his alleged scheme. Additional reporting by Evan Simko-Bednarski With Post wires  ",2022-12-13

The 13-page indictment says that, beginning in 2019, Bankman-Fried devised “a scheme and artifice to defraud” FTX’s customers and investors, diverting their money to pay expenses and debts at his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations. Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday by Bahamian authorities at the request of the U.S. government, which charged him with eight criminal violations, ranging from wire fraud to money laundering to conspiracy to commit fraud. He was also charged with making illegal campaign contributions, a notable charge as Bankman-Fried was one of the largest political donors this year. The charges could land Bankman-Fried in jail for decades, carrying maximum penalties of 115 years, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for U.S. prosecutors. The criminal indictment is on top of civil charges announced earlier Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleges Bankman-Fried defrauded investors and illegally used their money to buy real estate on behalf of himself and family. U.S. authorities said they will try to claw back any of Bankman-Fried’s financial gains from the alleged scheme. They are expected to request his extradition to the U.S., although the timing of that request is unclear. A lawyer for Bankman-Fried, Mark S. Cohen, said Tuesday he is “reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.” FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when it ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run. Since FTX collapsed and before his arrest, Bankman-Fried had been holed up in his Bahamian luxury compound in Nassau. He was scheduled to appear in a Bahamian court Tuesday. The U.S. has not filed an extradition request with the Bahamas, but is expected to do so. Bankman-Fried was one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper; at one point his net worth reached $26.5 billion, according to Forbes. He was a prominent personality in Washington, donating millions of dollars toward mostly left-leaning political causes and Democratic political campaigns, though he also gave money to Republicans. FTX grew to become the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. That all unraveled quickly last month, when reports called into question the strength of FTX’s balance sheet. As customers sought to withdraw billions of dollars, FTX could not satisfy all the requests because it apparently had used its customers’ deposits to fund investments at Bankman-Fried’s trading arm, Alameda Research. “We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The SEC complaint alleges that Bankman-Fried had raised more than $1.8 billion from investors since May 2019 by promoting FTX as a safe, responsible platform for trading crypto assets. Instead, the complaint says, Bankman-Fried diverted customers’ funds to Alameda Research without telling them. “He then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses,” the complaint reads. “None of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers.” Alameda did not segregate FTX investor funds and Alameda investments, the SEC said, using that money to “indiscriminately fund its trading operations,” as well as other ventures of Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried’s arrest came just a day before he was due to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the committee, said she was “disappointed” that the American public, and FTX’s customers, would not get to see Bankman-Fried testify under oath. That hearing went ahead, however, with FTX’s new CEO, John Ray III, providing withering testimony about the company’s practices. Ray told Congress that the collapse of FTX, resulting in the loss of more than $7 billion, was the culmination of months, or even years, of bad decisions and poor financial controls. “This is not something that happened overnight or in a context of a week,” he said. He added: “This is just plain, old fashioned embezzlement, taking money from others and using it for your own purposes. This is not sophisticated at all.” Bankman-Fried said recently that he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and that he believes angry customers will eventually get their money back. Bankman-Fried has also said he believes FTX was a victim of a sudden market collapse, and that customer deposits were safe up until then. The SEC challenged Bankman-Fried’s assertion Tuesday in its complaint. “FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.” The collapse of FTX — which followed other cryptocurrency debacles earlier this year — is adding urgency to efforts to regulate the industry. Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in financial and securities regulation, said U.S. lawmakers and regulators have been too slow to act, but that is likely to change. “Lawmakers are clearly under pressure to do something, given that so many people have lost their money,” she said. ______ Associated Press Writer Fatima Hussein in Washington contributed to this report.Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter examines how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today's executives.

Firstly, Binance had tasked Mazars to perform an ""audit"" of its Bitcoin reserves. However, as per the auditor's press statement last week, the examination was quite narrow in its breadth, focusing only on ""in-scope"" assets and utilizing ""agreed-upon procedures."" In what proved to be a critical point of contention, the auditor noted: ""An agreed-upon procedures engagement is not an audit, review or other assurance engagement. An agreed-upon procedures engagement does not involve obtaining evidence for the purpose of the practitioner expressing an opinion or an assurance conclusion in any form."" Significantly, Binance's proof-of-reserves attestation glossed over the exchange's liabilities, with CZ laying down the proverbial gauntlet in the following words: ""Liabilities are harder; we don't owe loans to anyone; ask around."" Additionally, as we reported yesterday, Reuters sent another wave of jitters this week when it reported that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) is currently split on whether to formally level charges against Binance in a money laundering investigation that began in 2018, with some investigators now pushing for aggressively moving against key Binance executives, including its co-founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Moreover, the firm's lawyers have met with DoJ officials over the past few months to discuss a possible plea deal or an out-of-court settlement.  Reuters has it wrong again.  Now they're attacking our incredible law enforcement team. A team that we're incredibly proud of - they've made crypto more secure for all of us.  Here’s the full statement we sent the reporter and a blog about our remarkable law enforcement team. — Binance (@binance) December 12, 2022  Binance countered the report by denying any ""insight"" into the inner workings of the Department of Justice while highlighting the exchange's contribution to upholding the law.

Binance USDC withdrawals are temporarily paused, because the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD.

The arrest of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried on Monday was sudden and unexpected in light of Bankman-Fried’s plan to testify before Congress this week.     As a criminal defense attorney, my reaction to the arrest on Monday night remains unchanged: this is the first time that I can recall where prosecutors moved aggressively to stop a defendant from making self-incriminating statements. His testimony would have been entirely admissible and likely devastating at trial.I have previously written about how Bankman-Fried was doing harm to his case by speaking in the media and to Congress. So why would the Justice Department move to stop the self-inflicted damage? You have a major target who was about to voluntarily testify for hours.  FTX FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED ARRESTED IN BAHAMAS, US EXPECTED TO REQUEST EXTRADITION, AUTHORITIES SAY  That is ordinarily a dream for prosecutors, but the Justice Department moved quickly to prevent that from happening. At that stage, Bankman-Fried was not charged or in custody. He was not protected by Miranda or other constitutional rules from self-incriminating statements. Video  Indeed, some of us had already warned that he was causing himself considerable damage in making such statements. This was a defendant with a large legal team facing possible criminal charges who seemed eager to speak about his actions and motivations. Most prosecutors would sit back, make popcorn, and watch this unfold.The curious move led many to question whether the Biden administration was eager to prevent questions on Bankman-Fried’s political contributions and associations. He was the second-highest donor to Democratic causes in the last election cycle.  His mother, a law professor at Stanford also heads a major Democratic campaign fund.  FTX CEO BLAMES 'GROSSLY INEXPERIENCED' OWNERS FOR COLLAPSE, SAYS CUSTOMER MONEY FUNDED RISKY ALAMEDA TRADESIt is also possible that the Justice Department simply wanted to show the public that it was moving aggressively despite his close Democratic ties. It may have secured sufficient evidence (including possible cooperating witnesses) to satisfy the basis for charges and an extradition request. Moreover, the charges are likely to make some Democratic figures uncomfortable as this matter enters the criminal process. Video  Yet, that still does not explain why the Justice Department would not want to hear a full account from Bankman-Fried before effectively shutting him down as a criminal defendant. This is the first time that I can recall where the prosecutors, rather than defense counsel, moved effectively to muzzle a defendant.    Whatever the motivation, the timing of the charges effectively stopped the windfall of information coming from Bankman-Fried.FTX LIVE UPDATES: FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED INDICTED IN NEW YORK, ARRESTED IN BAHAMASBankman-Fried is accused of diverting customer funds from the start of his cryptocurrency exchange to support his hedge fund, Alameda Research.     He is also accused of using his fraudulent practices to fund a lavish lifestyle, buy real estate, make venture investments, and fund Democratic causes. The range of charges includes wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering. VideoNotably, the eight counts include violating campaign finance laws, a charge that could prove embarrassing for some powerful political interests.The charges are on top of charges announced earlier Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged Bankman-Fried defrauded investors and used proceeds from investors to buy real estate on behalf of himself and family.  The details of those transactions might have been voluntarily disclosed under intense cross examination if the administration allowed him to appear as a witness. Moreover, Bankman-Fried was already causing himself considerable harm in media interviews.              next          Image 1 of 3 CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried testifies during a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee at Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill December 8, 2021 in Washington, DC.

His father, Joseph Bankman, is a tax professor and was a paid employee of his son’s company. His mother reportedly worked with him on some of these massive donations to Democrats.EX-CRYPTO BOSS SAM BANKMAN-FRIED SLAMMED FOR COMMITTING ‘PURE AND SIMPLE, GOOD OLD-FASHIONED FRAUD’   The parents are reportedly now concerned that the legal costs in the case could ""wipe them out.""Bankman-Fried has admitted that only a few hours of efforts a day might have avoided these losses. It sounds like a ""my bad"" defense. That will not fly in court and building on that defense might have sealed his fate.

It is not quite that easy in a criminal case.  If he had testified before the House this week, Bankman-Fried could not only have made any criminal defense more difficult but he could have potentially tripped the wire for allegedly false or misleading statements under oath.

Even cryptos started pulling their weight on a daily basis, which together with advance bond, dollar, PMs and commodities price action, provided ample clues as to why my bullish bias presented in yesterday‘s extensive analysis – one not to miss – is to usher in Santa Claus rally. Whether you look at it several hours before the decelerating CPI release, or dozen of minutes before that, it was plain obvious. Both headline and core CPI cooperated, and markets are positioning for a no event FOMC tomorrow (I‘m deliberately, tongue in cheek, exaggerating).

And how about the unwritten rule to get Fed funds rate 0.5% above inflation so as to make it restrictive?  Taking on the supply side drivers of inflation (crippled supply and excess demand being equally and largest inflation drivers as per Fed‘models) with demand side tools, isn‘t working as fast as the Fed wants, and the still hot labor market (3.7% unemployment rate with 5% nominal wage growth) is also proving sticky.  This one though would be unrecognizable by the end of 2023 as at least full three points can be added to the unemployment rate easily. Don‘t forget the declining participation rate effects either.Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out. So, the Fed is going to be stuck with sticky inflation and high commodity prices – even if base metals and agrifoods are likely to do better than energy over the months ahead. The Fed hasn‘t yet gotten restrictive, and markets with all their retracements of hits taken (such as Friday) are betting it wouldn‘t – the pivot hopes are still central to the bullish case at and beyond the Santa Claus time. It‘s ultimately a conflict between how deep and widespread toll the current tightening would take – it‘s about the Moynihan and Dimon viewpoints. I would argue that the first forecast of an isolated hit somewhere where it doesn‘t hurt or spread that much, with the Fed then saving the day through easy money, is a too optimistic one.  The fact that so many on Wall Street are predicting earnings to grow above inflation at the most narrow margin in 40 years (6% over 5%, equalling 1%), with this being the bullish case, tells you a lot about the challenges we are to face next year. JPM‘s more realistic scenario assumes a tougher recession, one on the quite immediate horizon. One that wouldn‘t be easy to solve through liquidity injections. One that would bring down earnings, labor market and inflation more than anticipated.  PMIs at this level never misindicated a recession, and yield curve inversion is highest since early 1980s. Hard landing if you will, with the Fed not blinking, and not cutting rates after Jun 2023, but keeping the Fed funds rate at 5.5%  (higher if wage growth pressures persist – and odds are they would surprise the central bank still as we‘re in an environment of sticky inflation and rising yields, so don‘t overstay your long TLT welcome). In such an environment, Santa Claus rally has a tough job running, running far. It needs CPI slowdown to beat expectations, and then the Fed to do 50bp only as priced in. With the statement and conference, any words would be good to grasp at – in a Hail Mary bullish fashion. And that‘s what we got precisely, in lien with my last week inflation deceleration calls – enough for the bulls to run with.  See that volume and value with tech both kicking in yesterday? The tide was rising, in the last hours before the closing bell. Typical… And off to the races in a Hail Mary bullish fashion (chart courtesy of www.stockcharts.com).

He has said he maintains a spartan lifestyle, and has donated millions of dollars to causes such as animal welfare, reducing global warming, and combating neglected tropical diseases.His personal fortune was once at nearly $25 billion, according to Forbes magazine.The son of Stanford Law School professors and a graduate of the elite Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Bankman-Fried worked as a broker on Wall Street before turning to cryptocurrencies in 2017.He created a cryptocurrency investment fund, Alameda Research, moved to Hong Kong and then launched FTX.Bankman-Fried, known on social media as SBF, was a vocal advocate for smoother access to the crypto market for the general public, particularly in the United States.The success of FTX enabled the platform to forge prestigious partnerships, including with the newly retired American football legend Tom Brady and his wife, the Brazilian ex-model Gisele Bundchen.Bankman-Fried moved the company to the Bahamas, where taxes are almost nonexistent, saying the Caribbean nation is one of the few countries that has a comprehensive licensing regime for cryptocurrencies.As his star rose, Fortune magazine wondered if he would be the new Warren Buffet.However, things quickly went sour.FTX's implosion was swift following a November 2 report on the cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk on ties between FTX and Alameda.The report exposed that Alameda's balance sheet was heavily built on the FTT currency -- a token created by FTX and with no independent value.The price of FTT plunged in early November, roiling both Alameda and FTX, where Alameda had large trading positions.Reeling from customer withdrawals and short some $8 billion, FTX and some 100 related entities filed for bankruptcy protection on November 11.Among the revelations, FTX propped up Alameda with billions of dollars in customer funds that are now likely lost forever.Questions also linger over whether Bankman-Fried engaged in market manipulation, or illegally provided inside information to Alameda.Despite the questions hanging over his company's activities, Bankman-Fried defied legal advice and kept appearing on talk shows and conference panels, offering his version of his company's sudden failure, usually by video link from the Bahamas.Then came his arrest on Monday in the idyllic archipelago, at the request of the United States, and charges of money laundering, wire fraud, and violating campaign finance laws.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said the onetime crypto wunderkind was ""responsible for fraudulently raising billions of dollars from investors in FTX and misusing funds belonging to FTX's trading customers.""Bankman-Fried has acknowledged poor corporate controls and mistakes, however, denies any criminal wrongdoing.""I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone,"" Bankman-Fried told a New York Times conference on November 30. ""Clearly I made a lot of mistakes or things I would be able to give anything to be able to do over again.""Instead of boosting investor confidence in cryptocurrency, Bankman-Fried's downfall sent major cryptocurrencies plunging, only raising further doubt over the young and turbulent sector.",2022-12-13

In some cases, individuals who helped us complete key initiatives have left on their own accord and are not being replaced. In other cases, we've made the decision to eliminate or streamline parts of the organization where we can leverage the work completed over the past 18 months to operate with increased efficiency.Story continuesWe now have a firm understanding of the resources required to pursue opportunities in gaming as well as high potential growth categories like collectibles and pre-owned businesses. Looking ahead, we have two overarching priorities: achieving profitability in the near term; and driving pragmatic growth over the long term. Now that the necessary investments have been made and we have identified the aforementioned opportunity set, we're going to be very judicious with respect to how we allocate capital to the core business. Maintaining a sizable cash position will maximize our optionality and keep us strong against the challenging economic backdrop. If a strategic asset or complementary business becomes available in the right price range, we want to be able to explore those acquisitions.As a result of these steps and our planning, we believe GameStop is well positioned, heading into 2023. We stand to benefit from our strong cash position, lack of debt, healthy inventory mix, shrinking cost structure and disciplined focus on categories where we have competitive positioning. We are also fortunate that the Company's exposure to digital assets has been very modest, thanks to risk management efforts. The Company has proactively minimized exposure to cryptocurrency risk throughout the year and does not currently hold a material balance of any token. Although we continue to believe there is long-term potential for digital assets in the gaming world, we have not and will not risk meaningful stockholder capital in the space. Let me now turn to our financial results for Q3.See also 10 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy and Stocks On the Rise: 12 Best Stocks To Buy.Net sales were $1.186 billion for the quarter compared to $1.297 billion in the prior year's third quarter. Approximately $50 million of the decline is attributable to FX. Sales attributable to new and expanded brand relationships remained strong. Likewise, sales in the collectibles category remained strong on a year-to-date basis. SG&A was $387.9 million or 32.7% of sales compared to $421.5 million or 32.5% of sales, in last year's third quarter. Notably, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down on a sequential basis from 34.1% in Q2 of this year. We've also taken additional steps in recent weeks to further reduce SG&A on a go-forward basis, now that significant improvements have been made to the core business. We reported a net loss of $94.7 million or $0.31 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $105.4 million or $0.35 in the prior year's third quarter.As with SG&A, we saw a healthy reduction in our net loss on a sequential basis versus Q2 of this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.042 billion. We continue to maintain a strong cash position while sustaining strong in-stock levels for the busy holiday season. With respect to inventory, we have strengthened our position in recent months by divesting a small percentage of merchandise that was acquired late in 2021 and early in 2022. Divestitures occurred in categories seeing soft customer demand over multiple quarters. Inventory was $1.131 billion at the close of Q3 compared to $1.141 billion at the close of the prior year's third quarter. At the close of the reporting period, we had no borrowings under our ABL facility and no debt other than a low interest unsecured term loan associated with the French government's response to COVID-19.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13 million, up $0.5 million from last year's third quarter. We anticipate CapEx will remain at similar or reduced levels now that the Company has largely completed its period of heavy investment. In the third quarter, cash flow provided by operations was $177.3 million compared to an outflow of $293.7 million during the same period last year. In terms of an outlook, we're not providing formal guidance at this time. It is worth reiterating, however, that our goal is to achieve profitability in the near term. I want to finish by reiterating what we've said in the past. We're attempting to accomplish something unprecedented in the retail sector. We're seeking to transform a legacy brick-and-mortar business that was on the brink of bankruptcy into a retailer that meets customers' needs through our stores, e-commerce properties and emerging sales channels.This path carries risk and is taking time, but it is the path we are on. With that said, GameStop is a stronger business today than at any time in the recent past. I'll leave it there for this quarter. Thank you.Operator:",2022-12-13

Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce … [+4774 chars]",Decrypt,"If the focus of the crypto industry is still on trading crypto assets, it’s a sign that the industry hasn’t lived up to its potential, according to ADADSecurities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce often feels she's ""on an island by myself"" within the SEC. ""I view these things differently than some of my colleagues have viewed them.""That's an understatement. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made very clear that he views most crypto assets as securities in need of SEC registration, and has painted the industry as a Wild West, Peirce, one of five commissioners at the U.S. banking regulator, has long been openly pro-crypto, though in her framing, ""I'm more pro the ability of people to try things and experiment with things, and I think there's been a lot of interesting experimentation in the crypto space, and I expect there'll be a lot more in coming years."" Peirce spoke to Decrypt last week for the latest episode of the gm podcast. She prefaced her comments, as she always does, by saying they are her own, and do not represent the views of the SEC. Peirce was initially nominated to serve as an SEC commissioner by President Barack Obama in 2016, but the Senate did not act on her nomination until 2017. She’s currently serving a 5-year term, which is set to expire in 2025. ""Because I've been at the SEC since 2018, to see no real movement—positive movement—in that time, is frustrating.""She said she first heard about Bitcoin around 2012 and has been learning about the broader crypto ecosystem ever since. But her interests are broader than that, she said, adding that her optimism around the industry has more to do with her desire to change the SEC’s approach to innovative new financial products—crypto and otherwise.“It’s wanting to keep the doors open to innovation, wanting to make sure that the financial industry is not one that’s dominated by a few large firms that keeps everyone else out. Because there are a lot of people with great ideas and I think it’s great that people are challenging the way we’ve done things,” she said.The FTX effectAt the time of Peirce's interview last week, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried hadn’t yet been arrested in The Bahamas and the SEC hadn’t yet charged him for allegedly defrauding equity investors in the company. Since Monday night, the Department of Justice has also levied charges, alleging he committed conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering, and the CFTC plans a lawsuit for commodities law violations.ADADCracks in the foundation of FTX started to show in early November, when a report revealed that the crypto exchange's sister company, Alameda Research, held billions in illiquid FTT (the exchange token of FTX) on its balance sheet. A subsequent tweet from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao referencing those ""revelations"" triggered massive withdrawals from FTX. After a few days, FTX had to freeze funds. The company sought a buyout first from Binance, but ultimately filed for bankruptcy on November 11.Last week, Peirce said she’d been telling people that everything Bankman-Fried came to represent is not, in her view, the extent of the crypto’s industry’s potential.“When I talk to people, I remind people, one: that crypto is not about centralized entities; two: that crypto is not about trading, either,"" Peirce said. ""Although there’s been a lot of emphasis on trading in the last several years, that is not the core of what crypto is. And if it is the core, it’s probably not living up to its potential. And three: it is still early days, so we do have more to see.”Now that Bankman-Fried has been arrested and charged by multiple entities, Peirce’s warning about regulatory frameworks born out of reactions to the FTX blowup is especially prescient. What she hopes not to see, she said, is another big legislative push that happens before thorough analysis has been done, like after the 2008 global financial crisis. “I think we should all be on the lookout for regulatory frameworks that are developed in the context of enforcement action, because it’s a very tempting thing for regulators to do that,” she said. “And it just cuts everybody else out of the process.”She recalled that the 2008 recession was the catalyst for a lot of new regulations. The biggest and most sweeping measure was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which itself paved the way for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Financial Stability Oversight Council, and the Volcker Rule to curtail speculative investments.It’s telling that the DOJ itself has compared the FTX collapse to Lehman Brothers. While Peirce said she has been vocal in not wanting to see a big wave of reactionary regulation, she recommends that companies in the crypto industry proceed with caution.""I urge people: The reach of the securities laws is very broad,"" she said. ""If you have any doubt—even if you don’t have any doubt—it’s good to think about calling a lawyer.”ADADListen and subscribe to the gm podcast wherever you get your podcasts.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.Your EmailGet it!Get it!Copy link",2022-12-13

You know that feeling, when you momentarily are not sure of where you are in the timeline and you wonder what you’ve missed. We’re there now.The “blockchain not bitcoin” chorus seems to be re-emerging, taking us back to the 2016-18 heyday of thematic and platform consortia convinced that the benefits of greater efficiency would overcome corporate competition. Bitcoin was an asset with no backing or clear utility, the implied argument seemed to go, whereas blockchain, well that was a technology.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.Last week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto,” in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Last month, Citi published the results of a survey showing that 92% of participating institutions see value in tokenization while 88% are either exploring distributed ledger use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. Over the past few days, the Red Cross talked about ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype, and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group announced plans to work on soulbound tokens for digital identity.What’s going on? Is this part of a post-FTX “reset,” a cathartic back-to-basics? Or is something else in play?Both. Yes, we are likely to see more public discussion about distributed ledger efficiencies and less about crypto asset trading and investment. This is a natural reflex after the damage done by layered leverage, flimsy tokenomics and trading fraud, and some high-profile reminders that crypto is not just about greed are more than welcome.Read more: BTC Dominance Is Behaving Weirdly, and That’s Sort of Good | OpinionIt is also an acknowledgement that there is a constant battle for attention, and the “X not Y” model assumes that only one variable is worthy. “Blockchain not bitcoin” emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market’s performance woes – the new version does the same but swaps in “crypto” to reflect the ecosystem’s spread.So, a large part of this is a cyclical narrative shift. But there’s something else going on as well. This shift comes on top of a longer-term tale of technological evolution and shiny things.The last wave of blockchain hype may not seem to have produced much value. Pilots and proofs of concept involving lettuce, plastics, even (alarmingly) nuclear weapons seemed to deliver no practical utility. Groups working on blockchain use cases for trade finance, healthcare, telecoms, insurance and more have either gone quiet or been wound down.And we have seen some recent high-profile distributed ledger failures. A couple of weeks ago, IBM and Maersk announced the closure of their blockchain-based supply chain joint venture TradeLens. Last month, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) canceled its much-hyped blockchain project after years of delays and cost overruns. This summer blockchain-based trade finance initiative we.trade, backed by IBM and 12 major European banks, went into liquidation and B3i – a blockchain insurance venture backed by more than 20 insurers and reinsurers – ceased operation.So, the “please, not again” discomfort at the renewed protagonism of “blockchain” potential is understandable and even healthy (inflated expectations of any sort should be kept in check) – but not necessarily correct.Both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology’s evolution. Remember the dot-com bubble? That wasn’t just about crazy stock valuations – it was as much about the promise of rapid societal change, with business models rewiring their engagement models and individuals flourishing in their new-found creative independence. In the early days of any radical innovation, manifesto and prophecy often get confused, and experimentation – of which failure is an integral part – is the only way to test the bounds of reality.See also: Central Banks and Bitcoin: Closer Than You Think | OpinionYou’re probably wondering where the successes are, and that’s fair because they don’t get much attention. They’re hidden in the persistence of some projects that could have given up ages ago, in new use cases under trial, and in a changing participant profile. Distributed ledger work has been ongoing all along, but given the rapid growth of crypto markets, the “flashiness” of some participants and the gripping drama of the year so far, it has been largely overlooked. Things that move fast get more attention. Enterprise experimentation does not move fast.Some examples: A few years ago, we got excited when a commercial bank successfully issued blockchain-based assets in pilot tests. This week a state-owned bank did the same but for real, and at least one government is almost there, while other governments and banks are testing the process with some intriguing innovations. We also have trials where the main participants are central banks. That is definitely progress.Large traditional asset managers such as KKR, Apollo and Hamilton Lane are issuing blockchain-based tokens representing funds. Not as a proof-of-concept but for real. Just this week we learned that Vanguard Australia is using a distributed ledger for back-office settlement, Starbucks (one of the largest unregulated “banks” in the world) has launched a non-fungible token (NFT) experience in beta for its Rewards users, and Goldman Sachs as well as Germany’s music rights management society have carried out separate distributed ledger tests. Recent initiatives seem to have learned from the failures to date: start small, iterate up the ladder and never overlook human incentives.​There’s also an ideological battle afoot. Many in the crypto industry hate the idea of anything being “permissioned” and accuse all gated experimentation of being “useless” while overlooking regulatory restrictions and client preferences. The assumption seems to be that everyone prefers open networks, permissioned blockchains can never be based on public ones and that the potential to integrate with stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) is irrelevant.Read more: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto’s Founding Mission | OpinionThere’s also a strong cohort who thinks we should focus on more innovative applications since traditional markets work fine, in spite of settlement risk, gated access and a dangerous lack of transparency. More efficient and lower cost debt markets, for example, open up opportunities for a much broader demographic than big banks, possibly facilitating the development of sophisticated markets in regions currently underserved. They also make new types of products possible, such as intraday repo, enhancing liquidity in tight markets. Could this be done on traditional databases? Some of it, sure, but would that be future-proofing market evolution? Determining the answer to that is precisely what the experimentation is for.As the dust settles on the FTX fallout, and as the crypto ecosystem takes stock of the damage and starts to heal, we can expect more prominence for enterprise blockchain milestones. This doesn’t at all mean that crypto is losing its sparkle or that asset innovation is done. Last week we saw the emergence of an intriguing new derivative that lets traders bet on the Ethereum staking yield, potentially coalescing market acceptance of a benchmark interest rate. We are also still seeing glimmers of institutional interest in crypto assets as investment. None of that will disappear.But a time in the sun for the less-glamorous side of blockchain evolution will be good for the industry as a whole. We could well still see some ideas that strike us as fanciful, because people are people and creativity should never cease to surprise – who knows, some might even stick. But we can certainly expect more solid experimentation at senior levels.Perhaps even more important: we have to push back on the “X not Y” mentality. The crypto ecosystem is certainly big enough by now for any number of approaches, and this industry grew on the back of permissionless innovation – it’s incongruous to see crypto enthusiasts argue that only one approach is worth any time or attention. For those who care about distributed ledger utility, there’s plenty to get excited about. For those who think there’s greater societal value in trading and saving, markets will continue to evolve and some prices will eventually recover. Many of us may be frustrated by the amount of pixels given to what we personally see as useless ideas – but we should think about what our industry would look like were one reduced group to have the power to decide what is “valid” and what isn’t.Meanwhile, the narrative shift will act as a refreshing reminder that this industry is about much more than profits and portfolio allocations, and that the potential goes way beyond sentiment recovery, regulatory clarity and deeper understanding. “Blockchain and crypto” – there’s plenty of room for both.",2022-12-13

On top of that, Bankman-Fried used one of his affiliates, Alameda (which was reportedly run by his girlfriend), as ""his personal piggy bank,"" the document emphasized.The indictment also mentioned the fact that the FTX founder engaged ""some of the most trustworthy public figures,"" including Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Steph Curry, and others to promote his company.

Some even presumed that it was done deliberately to not allow the FTX founder to spill the beans about his rich and powerful customers.""Complex frauds take time to unravel so I am prepared to give prosecutors and investigators the benefit of the doubt, for now,"" remarked Ortel. ""At the very least, those in the media who recently likened SBF to Warren Buffett have much to reconsider.""Meanwhile, Miranda Devine, an investigative journalist, specializing in money laundering and fraud issues, tweeted on December 12 that ""[US President Joe] Biden's Security and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler deleted key details of meetings with George Soros, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi from the public version of his calendar."" ""Did they discuss FTX and SBF?"" the writer asked.""Devine's observations are noteworthy on their own and also call into question which other Biden (or Trump and Obama) administration officials may have shielded truths about the nature of their meetings with key campaign contributors while in government service,"" the Wall Street analyst highlighted.Gary Gensler deserves special attention, according to Ortel. Gensler, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, served as the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign's chief financial officer. The Wall Street analyst, who has been conducting a private investigation into the Clinton Foundation's alleged fraud, suspects that Team Clinton ""arguably bent if not shredded campaign finance and public disclosures rules at the time and afterwards.""In addition to that, SBF apparently had links to some other politicians in the White House.

Some days we have net withdrawals; some days, we have net deposits. Business as usual for us. I actually think it is a good idea to “stress test withdrawals” on each CEX on a rotating basis. Bitcoin exchange outflows are often a bullish indicator. In the current context, with inflation declining and a potential U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) pivot, the perception around outflows changed.  Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 2.58% In 24 Hours, Can It Reach $0.1 Before The Week Runs Out?

The digital… [+5161 chars]",MarketWatch,"The blowup of crypto platform FTX and the saga of founder Sam Bankman-Fried are still unfolding, but this is a good time to contemplate where the virtual currency industry goes from here.  The digital asset class has stumbled, but it isn’t down for the count. Whether one believes any of the major narratives — bitcoin          BTCUSD,         +2.95%        is the savior of the world’s financial system; blockchain is a revolutionary innovation; digital assets are exciting trading vehicles — there’s no denying that an unrelenting industry has grown around digital assets.   Whether companies failed because of fraud, as evidence is suggesting may be the case in FTX and Celsius, or for more complex reasons, the disappearance of such a large swath of the industry opens opportunities for newer, well-managed companies to take leadership positions. It is time for the third generation of digital asset companies to emerge.  Read: Who is Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX ex-CEO who is now facing criminal charges? The first generation of financial firms that pioneered the digital assets space are commonly known as “exchanges.” These pioneers operate as single-entity combinations of the traditionally separated broker, custodian and exchange businesses. The earliest of this cohort was the failed exchange Mt. Gox, but arguably the real genesis of the industry came about with the emergence of the powerhouses of today: Kraken and Coinbase          COIN,         +2.78%        in the U.S., and Binance offshore. Brian Armstrong, founder and CEO of Coinbase, and Jesse Powell, founder and chairman of Kraken, deserve substantial credit for growing the cryptocurrency market within the U.S. to the extent that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve reported in their “Economic Well-Being of U.S. Householders in 2021” that 12% of adults held or used cryptocurrencies in the prior year. These early movers specialize in transactional services, the buying and selling of cryptocurrency, and generate the bulk of their revenues from commissions. A problem for such businesses is that, over time, commissions tend to trend toward zero. Today, there is no liquid financial asset class other than cryptocurrency where the intermediaries are able to extract meaningful commissions from customers, and there is no reason to believe that cryptocurrency commissions will persist.   The second-generation companies are all but gone. The defining characteristic of this group is that they tried to improve the viability of the business model by emulating traditional financial-services providers and offer similar products, but without the controls, regulations and even experience required in the traditional world. FTX, Celsius, Voyager and others are bankrupt, and Gemini is experiencing well-publicized difficulties and has frozen certain withdrawals. Customers flocked to the products that appeared familiar, such as gathering deposits, paying interest on them and lending out the money, and other banking-type products. But these shadow-banking activities tended to lead to the collapse of crypto firms.  Third-generation crypto players are beginning to emerge, and it is still too early for them to be household names. The hallmark of “Gen 3” is a powerful blend of the best benefits of digital assets and the underlying technology, with the safety and soundness of the traditional banking and financial-services industry. Keep an eye on Cross River Bank, Custodia Bank and, despite some stumbles, perhaps Anchorage Digital. My own company in this area is called LevelField Financial. The third-generation crypto companies have more traditional structures and are often run by financial industry veterans with a vision for an improved monetary system. The banking industry in the U.S. has an opportunity to work within the established structure to deliver on the promise of digital assets and bring crypto within the regulatory fold. Larger, established entities are moving slowly into digital assets. Fidelity recently announced support for crypto trading, and it is joining other financial institutions including Robinhood Markets          HOOD,         +1.00%,        SoFi Technologies          SOFI,         -2.04%        and Vast Bank. These companies are part of the movement but are not true third-generation firms. There is a difference between offering products within a broad array versus striving to enhance the customer experience by adopting the best of the digital and traditional industries. We should soon expect to see more digitally focused companies seeking to work within the highly regulated financial-services industry. Now is the time for the regulatory bodies to make clear who is responsible for what in the digital ecosystem.  The data is still trickling into the public domain regarding the collapse of the second-generation crypto exchanges. It seems time and again the failed management teams didn’t understand how to operate within the financial-services industry, or that their first responsibility was to safeguard customer money. This is not the end, and the entire financial-services industry will become stronger and improved as third-generation crypto-services providers grow and become meaningful participants. For those who see digital-asset trading as an exciting experience, the volatility should be in the assets and not the financial intermediary.  Gene Grant is the CEO of LevelField Financial.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the latest CPI data, released today, shows signs of inflation slowing.         “The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose 0.1 percent in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, after increasing 0.4 percent in October, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 7.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.” CPI data measures how much the prices of consumer goods and services change. The CPI typically reflects the spending patterns of urban consumers and urban wage earners, which represent about 93% of the US population. The data does not account for consumers living outside of metropolitan areas. Crypto markets appear to be bouncing on the release of the CPI data as well as the most recent development in the FTX fiasco – the arrest of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas. United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, made the announcement on Twitter. “Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY. We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.” According to crypto data aggregator Coinglass, over $100 million in shorts have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, making it the biggest market cleanup since November 10th. At time of writing, the two leading cryptos by market cap, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), are both up approximately 5% in the last 24 hours, while the total market cap of all digital assets is up 3% in the past seven hours.

Authorities and crypto investors are keenly following the developments of SBF’s arrest, with the ensuing legal proceedings expected to throw more light on what led to the collapse of FTX. Investors who lost money in FTX are also seeking justice and would ultimately like to know the fate of their investment. SBF is reported to have hired attorney Mark Cohen. The arrest of SBF in the Bahamas is only the start of what is expected to be a lengthy legal proceeding that could involve extradition to the US. It is still unclear at this point as to which direction the legal proceeding shall take, as the Bahamas is also investigating the collapse of FTX. SBF had been scheduled to testify in Congress before the US House Committee on Financial Services on Dec 13, 2022. However, following news of SBF’s arrest in the Bahamas, the Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee released the following statement on Monday, December 12, 2022: Advertisement          “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many. The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity. While I am disappointed that we will not be able to hear from Mr. Bankman-Fried tomorrow, we remain committed to getting to the bottom of what happened, and the Committee looks forward to beginning our investigation by hearing from Mr. John Ray III tomorrow.” Mr. John Ray III, the newly appointed CEO of FTX Debtors, is scheduled to testify before the US House Committee on Financial Services on December 13, 2022. Mr John Ray III possesses extensive legal and restructuring experience, including overseeing the unwinding of Enron following its accounting scandal in 2001. SBF is scheduled to appear on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, in the Magistrate Court, in Nassau, the Bahamas. SBF is facing charges and scrutiny from several authorities and other law enforcement agencies, including prosecutors for the Southern District of New York, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Department, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).                                            Ads by Cointraffic            ",2022-12-13

That analyst, Citigroup’s Christopher Allen, downgraded Robinhood          HOOD,         +1.00%        to neutral from buy and lowered the price target on shares of the popular stock-trading app to $10 from $11. Shares of Robinhood were down around 2.4% on Tuesday.  Allen said Robinhood had cut costs and made its platform more attractive to active traders. But he said uncertainty surrounding the stock market next year, as well as the cratering of the crypto market, made for a “mixed outlook” on the company.  Allen said that following last year’s meme-stocks frenzy, trading activity on Robinhood has cooled. He said “a sustained move higher in equity markets” — something that is far from guaranteed next year — would be needed to spur stronger trading activity.   While stock trading on Robinhood has been stable in recent months, the analyst said he expected Robinhood’s crypto-trading revenue to drop at least 50% for both this year and next year. And he said the shockwaves from FTX’s collapse could ripple through to Robinhood in a variety of ways.  One, he said, was the potential liquidation of the 56.3 million Robinhood shares — or 7.4% of its outstanding stock — owned by Bankman-Fried, FTX’s founder and former chief executive, through Emergent Fidelity Technologies. The timing of that liquidation, Allen said, was not yet clear.  Allen said the scrutiny of FTX also removed it as a potential buyer of Robinhood. And the fallout raised the possibility of lower trading revenues for Robinhood’s crypto segment, “given substantial price declines and material deterioration in investor confidence.”  Analysts have offered similar assessments for crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. Bank of America, in a note last month, said that while Coinbase          COIN,         +2.78%        was unlikely to be “another FTX,” it still faced “a number of new headwinds over the near/medium term due to the recent collapse of rival crypto exchange FTX.” Needham analyst John Todaro also said Coinbase wasn’t immune to possible “contagion” from FTX’s downfall, while noting it had “little direct exposure” to FTX.  Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday. On Tuesday, the U.S. attorney’s office of the Southern District of New York charged him with wire fraud against customers and lenders, commodities and securities fraud, money laundering, and defrauding the U.S.  The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday also charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors, accusing him of steering FTX users’ money to Alameda Research — a trading firm he co-founded in 2017 — and trying to conceal the diversion of the funds.  FTX, launched in 2019 and based in the Bahamas, filed for bankruptcy protection last month after revelations from the crypto news site Coindesk about Alameda’s shaky finances — and the degree to which it was intertwined with FTX — prompted a run on the exchange.

This should include, if not be led by, the Federal Reserve, which after all, is the guarantor of the fiat system. Inaction is not an option, since more and more Americans' savings—and even retirement accounts—are exposed to crypto.When crypto sneezes, our whole economy catches a cold. Investment banks are scrambling to retrieve money after the FTX collapse. I believe we are in the early stages of what happened in the '90s dot-com bubble and the 2008 housing crash—a speculative bubble that has been ignored by regulators for too long. It's now being addressed by prosecutors, but prosecutors can only act after things blow up—not before.Regulation is always a delicate balance. But if regulators had moved this early in the dot-com and housing bubbles of previous years, perhaps market crashes could have been softened, or even averted. The parallels are eerie. In 2021, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed by more than 700 percent in only 12 months and then quickly lost three-quarters of its value.The dot-com bubble was similar. Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index jumped 400 percent, only to fall 78 percent from its high by October 2002.

How the Media Fell for SBF's Con Game—Again and Again and Again Just as crypto is now, the '90s dot-com bubble was an investor's dream. And real value was created—this era gave birth to incredible companies that still exist today, like Amazon and Google. But for every valuable, sustainable company there were many more tech businesses formed out of thin air with no value proposition. That didn't stop them attracting huge investments often based on nothing more than a pitch deck and a domain name. This continued until the early 2000's—when the bubble burst.Markets fell by 78 percent, causing many tech companies to file for bankruptcy and disappear. When the dust settled, more than $5 trillion was lost. It was only when the damage was done that regulators acted with more stringent IPO processes.Regulators also acted too late during the housing crisis of 2008, which was fueled by cheap credit and lax lending standards. When that bubble burst, banks were left holding trillions of dollars of worthless investments. This likely caused the recession to be deeper than it would otherwise have been as the financial markets reset from what was a wide-reaching endemic problem. Many ordinary Americans lost their jobs, savings, and their homes in the process.  Gold-plated souvenir cryptocurrency Tether (USDT), Bitcoin and Ethereum coins arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart.  JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images Regulators must learn the lessons of history, or they are doomed to repeat it. An almost completely unregulated crypto market, couched (perhaps deliberately) in language that legislators barely understand, is more dangerous than either of the bubbles that came before, given the ease of accessibility by the masses compared to the previous bubbles.The economy was already vulnerable. Over a decade of effectively 0 percent interest rates was exacerbated by the pandemic. The result was increased lending, higher inflation and most importantly, lots of locked down, bored individuals with newfound disposable income thanks to COVID-19 assistance payments.Many of them were seduced by rags-to-riches stories and the potential for leverage to create outsized returns. The possibility of outsized losses was not such a focus for crypto influencers who are effectively acting as unregulated financial advisors. Like the run up to 2000 and 2008, there was an entire generation of inexperienced investors that haven't been through an economic cycle. They have only seen charts go up and to the right. Unlike those instances, all they had to do this time around was download an app, link a bank account, click a button and they were in. Technology is an amplifier of both the good and the bad.Arrests, where justified, are an important step in limiting the danger of the crypto bubble which is, even now, only partially popped. But the priority must be to protect the economy, the public, and to restore confidence before real damage is done.Other governments are quickly realizing this and taking action. The U.K. just announced they are finalizing plans to regulate the crypto sector. This includes monitoring how companies operate and advertise their products to the public. This is in the interests of investors, but also of the (legitimate) crypto industry. The U.K. prime minister has already stated that ""'effective regulation' would make Britain a global hub for cryptoasset technology.""As the largest economy in the world, the U.S. has a particular responsibility to take the lead. Just as the U.S. dollar is the ""gold standard"" of the traditional financial system and the Federal Reserve is its regulator, the U.S. and the Fed should be leading in the new crypto economy.We acted too late in 2000. We acted too late in 2008. In 2023, we can break the pattern.

(Video: Joy Yi/The Washington Post, Photo: Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/The Washington Post)Listen6 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveEver since Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire collapsed last month, conservative media has speculated about the justice — or the supposed lack thereof — awaiting him. Almost all of the speculation revolved around the fact that Bankman-Fried was a major donor to Democrats. Often, the suggestion has been that he was being treated more leniently by the Justice Department, or even given a pass.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIt’s certainly a commentary on our conspiratorial time — a time in which Republicans in particular assume slanted justice for high-profile figures — that people jumped to such conclusions so willy-nilly. President Donald Trump spent four years attacking the Justice Department for supposedly targeting him politically, even as he also attempted to wield it for his own political ends. It’s against that backdrop that certain circles just assumed that there was something suspicious about Bankman-Fried not yet being apprehended.Bankman-Fried’s arrest and indictment this week undercuts much of that baseless and hastily crafted narrative. And as always with such situations, it’s worth recalling who had a hand in the crafting.AdvertisementShortly after the FTX collapse in early November, Fox News and others pointed to the nearly $40 million in disclosed donations from Bankman-Fried, the vast majority of it to Democrats, making him the party’s second-largest donor in the 2022 election. And they continued applying the “Dem donor” label even after Bankman-Fried claimed that he contributed a similar amount to Republicans, but via so-called “dark money” groups that don’t have to disclose their donors.At their most speculative, the conspiracy theories suggested Bankman-Fried hadn’t yet been arrested — and even that he wouldn’t be scrutinized — because of those donations to Democrats.On Nov. 9, the Wall Street Journal reported that both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating FTX.But on Nov. 10, Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that “Biden’s Justice Department seems not very interested in a man called Sam Bankman-Fried. Why is that? Well, maybe because Bankman-Fried was the Democratic Party’s second-biggest donor this cycle.”AdvertisementOn Nov. 13, Elon Musk went so far as to say, “SBF was a major Dem donor, so no investigation,” even though the investigation was common knowledge.SBF was a major Dem donor, so no investigation— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 13, 2022  On Nov. 17, Fox’s Jesse Watters stated: “So, he bought the Senate for the Democrats. And has committed all sorts of atrocious financial crimes — bigger than Enron, bigger than [Bernie] Madoff — and he’s still sitting in the Bahamas trying to raise money. Why isn’t he shackled by the FBI? If this guy was a Republican donor he’d probably be sitting in solitary confinement right now.”On the same show, co-host Jeanine Pirro cited Bankman-Fried’s donations to Democrats and complained that he hadn’t been arrested and extradited from the Bahamas yet.On Dec. 1, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) appeared on Fox Business Network and said the situation suggested a “two-tiered” justice system. Host Maria Bartiromo quickly asked: “And why is that? Is it because he’s been the big donor to the Democrats? Is that why he’s not in jail right now?” Davidson said it was “possible” but mostly demurred, talking about more general failures of federal regulators to police white-collar crime.AdvertisementAnd as recently as last week, Carlson intoned, “Sam Bankman-Fried was the second-biggest donor to the Democratic Party. So in the end, we’re hearing that ‘the Justice Department is looking into him!’” Carlson quickly added: “He’s going to get away with it.”Five days later, Bankman-Fried was arrested, with the Justice Department obtaining a sweeping eight-count indictment against him that includes alleged campaign-finance violations.Share this articleShareNot that the purported delay between FTX’s collapse and Bankman-Fried’s arrest should have been surprising. While many have expressed apoplexy that Bankman-Fried wasn’t arrested earlier, it takes time to build white-collar cases. Some have noted that Madoff was arrested shortly after his misdeeds came to light. But as New York magazine noted this month, the situations aren’t terribly comparable:AdvertisementThe scheme was not detected by the government or the media — infamously — but was in fact revealed by Madoff himself, who confessed the whole thing to his sons once he realized that he could not keep up the fraud. According to the criminal complaint filed on the day of his arrest, Madoff told his sons “that he was ‘finished,’ that he had ‘absolutely nothing,’ that ‘it’s all just one big lie,’ and that it was ‘basically a giant Ponzi scheme.’” His sons called the FBI, and two days later, two agents showed up at his home and asked whether “there’s an innocent explanation” for what Madoff had told his sons. Madoff literally replied, “There is no innocent explanation.”By contrast, Bankman-Fried wasn’t so anxious to confess; he has repeatedly rejected the idea that his actions amounted to fraud.But as is often the case when such theories are undercut by later events, the goal posts are simply moved. Even when Bankman-Fried was ultimately arrested on Monday, many prominent voices on the right wagered that the timing was suspicious. The supposed reason? He was due to testify remotely on Tuesday to a House committee, at which time Republicans planned to grill him on his support for Democrats. Suddenly, Bankman-Fried wasn’t arrested too late, but too early.There is no actual reason to believe the Justice Department timed this to help Democrats, of course. But the theory also ignores that we will learn more information through the impending legal proceedings. It also ignores that Democrats in Congress could have used the hearing to press Bankman-Fried on an even more obscured piece of the puzzle: the donations he claimed he had made to Republican-oriented dark money groups.AdvertisementBankman-Fried said nearly a month ago that he had donated about as much to those groups as he did to Democrats, and that he had taken this tack because he wanted to avoid detection by reporters in the media who lean to the political left. He claimed to be “the second- or third-biggest Republican donor this year, as well.”There is no way to verify this — not yet, at least. Neither Bankman-Fried’s newly unsealed indictment nor an SEC complaint also released Tuesday shed much light on it. The SEC complaint does say that Bankman-Fried used money diverted from FTX “to make undisclosed private venture investments, political contributions, and real estate purchases.” But it’s not clear that “undisclosed” applies to the “political contributions” or what amounts we’re talking about. (The SEC didn’t reply to a request for comment.)It’s possible we could learn more now that the government is taking legal action. And a watchdog group last week urged the Federal Election Commission to investigate Bankman-Fried’s dark-money contributions, arguing that the way he described them showed he “admitted that he violated federal laws” that prohibit using dark money to influence federal elections.AdvertisementBut however dubious a character Bankman-Fried is, the possibility that we may learn he gave money to GOP groups would seem to be worth mentioning in all the conservative media coverage that characterizes him first and foremost as a Democratic donor. To the extent he did spread the wealth among an array of political causes across the ideological spectrum, it would further undercut the already baseless narrative that he was being protected because he allied with Democrats. Perhaps it’s worth being cautious.Of course, caution is not as much fun. And whatever the legal proceedings may reveal, at that point the people mentioned above could just move the goal posts again.Share CommentsLoading...",2022-12-13

He began facing scrutiny over his financial dealings earlier this year. In November, the beleaguered cryptocurrency exchange declared bankruptcy, meaning its investors could be left with nothing.The FTX CEO also made headlines for donating millions of dollars to Democratic candidates throughout the 2022 midterms, including Auchincloss, the vice chair of the Financial Services Committee.Bankman-Fried contributed $5,800 to Auchincloss' re-election campaign throughout 2022, according to Federal Election Commission data. The donations are within the legal limit, as an individual can donate up to $2,900 to a candidate in each election—meaning he donated the maximum amount to Auchincloss, who ran unopposed, during his primary and general elections.

(And yes, believe it or not, that was this year.) It was awkward and awful, although it did inspire some great reactions on social media, including one that predicted ""if anyone can kill NFT culture, it's Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton.""Now, as 2022 draws to a close, that prediction may be close to coming true, indirectly at least. Fallon, Hilton, and others who have used their celebrity to promote NFTs are facing a proposed class action lawsuit accusing them of fraud. The list of defendants in the suit, available via The Hollywood Reporter, is lengthy to say the least: It also includes Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Madonna, Justin Bieber, Gwyneth Paltrow, Serena Williams, Post Malone, Snoop Dogg, Kevin Hart, Steph Curry, DJ Khaled, Adidas, a pile of other people who names I don't recognize, and of course Yuga Labs, the parent company of the Bored Ape Yacht Club.""The Company presents the Bored Ape ecosystem as a brand that is organically beloved by some of the most famous celebrities in the world,"" the lawsuit states. ""But the truth is that the Company’s entire business model relies on using insidious marketing and promotional activities from A-list celebrities that are highly compensated (without disclosing such), to increase demand of the Yuga securities by convincing potential retail investors that the price of these digital assets would appreciate and that, as members of 'the club,' these investors would be given exclusive access to additional financial products and benefits.""The lawsuit alleges that all of the Bored Apes action over the past year was in fact ""a vast scheme"" between Yuga Labs, ""a highly-connected Hollywood talent agent"" named Guy Oseary, and MoonPay, a company that ""purports to be a white-glove service designed to help the super-rich and celebrities buy NFTs"" but is in fact, according to the lawsuit, ""a covert way to compensate the promoter defendants"" without disclosing it to investors.Naturally, the scheme worked: The endorsements increased both the interest in and the price of Bored Ape NFTs, the suit claims, ""causing investors to purchase these losing investments at drastically inflated prices.""Much of the suit actually turns on MoonPay, the NFT acquisition service, which numerous defendants had previously invested in. For instance, the lawsuit notes a segment that took place in a November 2021 episode of The Tonight Show, in which Fallon—the host—announced that he had purchased his first NFT through MoonPay during an interview with NFT artist Mike ""Beeple"" Winkelmann. The suit alleges that Fallon and Winkelmann were in fact ""recruited and paid"" to promote MoonPay and Bored Apes during the show; it also says that Winkelmann is ""direct business partners"" with Oseary, the high-powered talent agent, at another NFT company.""Fallon did not disclose that he had a financial interest in MoonPay or that he was likewise financially interested, directly or indirectly, in the increased sale and popularity of Yuga securities,"" the suit claims. ""Nor did EHD [Electric Hot Dog, Fallon's production company] or Universal disclose that this purportedly organic segment on the Tonight Show was in reality a paid advertisement for the BAYC collection of NFTs and MoonPay by two celebrities (Fallon and Winkelmann) who are business partners with an investor (Oseary) in both Yuga and MoonPay.""Similar allegations are made regarding Fallon's infamous interview with Paris Hilton: ""Hilton and MoonPay purposefully did not disclose Hilton’s direct financial interest in MoonPay and, relatedly, the increased sale of Yuga securities through MoonPay,"" the suit states. ""And again, there was no disclosure from any of the Tonight Show’s production companies, namely Defendants Universal or EHD, regarding Hilton’s and/or Fallon’s financial interests in MoonPay or compensation for promoting the BAYC NFTs.""The suit makes various allegations against the other defendants: For instance, it states that Gwyneth Paltrow announced that she had ""joined"" the Bored Apes Yacht Club in January 2022 and thanked MoonPay for its services, without disclosing that she was an investor in MoonPay and thus ""had a vested interest in sales of Yuga securities."" Bieber and Madonna were both allegedly given expensive NFTs in exchange for promoting Yuga and/or MoonPay. There are also purported links to the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, which failed spectacularly in November.Yuga Labs denied the claims in a statement sent to The Hollywood Reporter. ""In our view, these claims are opportunistic and parasitic,"" a spokesperson told the site. ""We strongly believe that they are without merit, and look forward to proving as much.""A few years ago, in response to a CS:GO influencer gambling scandal, funny enough, the FTC published updated disclosure guidelines for influencers that laid things out in pretty simple terms, like ""If a brand pays you or gives you free stuff, tell people about that relationship."" In that light, this might seem like a fairly open-and-shut case, if lawyers can prove that some form of payment, direct or indirect, was made in exchange for the promotions. There's a long way to go before this lawsuit adds up to anything, though, and no guarantee that it will at all: At this point, the law firm spearheading the case is seeking approval to pursue the matter as a class action.

Bankman-Fried, founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange, was arrested Monday following charges from the U.S. Justice Department. On Tuesday the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Bankman-Fried, commonly known as SBF, with committing fraud after raising $1.8 billion from investors.  The links between FTX and Alameda Research are coming under intense scrutiny. The cryptocurrency exchange used customer money to lend billions of dollars to Alameda for risky trades and investments, the Wall Street Journal reports. Citing FTX bankruptcy filings, the Wall Street Journal also reports that Bankman-Fried owned 90% of Alameda Research. Ellison is a Stanford University graduate who grew up in the suburbs of Boston, the daughter of two MIT economists, according to the Wall Street Journal. After graduation, she worked at quantitative trading firm Jane Street, where she met fellow trader Bankman-Fried. The 28-year-old was previously in a relationship with Bankman-Fried, reports say. See Now: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried arrested with U.S. set to unseal indictment Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX CEO on Nov.11, when the crypto exchange and its affiliates filed for bankruptcy. Ellison was subsequently fired from her role at Alameda. As the shockwaves from FTX’s collapse continue to reverberate, Ellison’s whereabouts have become a topic of interest on social media. Alameda Research is based in Hong Kong, as was FTX until its relocation to the Bahamas in 2021. “Caroline oh Caroline; wherefore art thou, oh Caroline Ellison,” tweeted one Twitter user on Tuesday.           “Where’s Caroline Ellison right now? @TheJusticeDept care?” tweeted another user.             See Now: SEC charges Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors in now-bankrupt FTX The former Alameda CEO was reportedly spotted at a Manhattan coffee shop earlier this month, prompting speculation that she may be cooperating with authorities. Ellison’s last tweet was on Nov. 9. Bloomberg reports that Ellison has hired Stephanie Avakian, former director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, to represent her. Avakian is now chair of the securities and financial services department at law firm WilmerHale. MarketWatch has reached out to WilmerHale with a request for comment on this story.  ",2022-12-13

However, BitMEX founder believes the asset has survived its darkest days and can expect a rally in the coming weeks. Arthur Hayes, ex-CEO of digital asset derivatives platform BitMEX, thinks BTC is set for a rally since the “largest most irresponsible entities” have sold the last of their Bitcoins. Hayes argues that all the firms prone to going bankrupt have all gone bankrupt, leaving the coast clear for the bulls. “I can’t demonstratively prove that all Bitcoin held by these failed institutions was sold during the multiple crashes, but it does look as if they tried their best to liquidate the most liquid crypto collateral they could right before they went under,” said Hayes. The former CEO backs his theory by saying that firms facing a liquidity crisis have no reason to hold onto their BTC when they urgently need fiat. Hayes notes that the typical playbook for distressed firms is to call in loans and then sell their BTC holdings to avoid going under. In the weeks after FTX’s collapse, BTC fell to $15,599 as entities affected by the black swan event unloaded their BTC holdings. In the last few months, several top players in the industry have filed for bankruptcy, including FTX, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and Celsius. Advertisement          BTC has an eventful week ahead Some analysts have termed this week the most important for BTC, with several key events on the horizon. First on the list is the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November and the decision of the Federal Reserve regarding rate hikes. Analysts believe that with two weeks till the end of the year, Bitcoin could go on a historical “Santa Rally”. Other factors that could decide BTC’s path are the U.S. dollar index (DXY) movement, Bitcoin’s supply shock ratio nearing a 10-year high, and the end of miners selling their assets. “The mother of all decisions is coming, expect huge volatility next week,” said one financial analyst. “The incoming DXY move will decide the fate of the crypto and stock market.”                                            Ads by Cointraffic            ",2022-12-13

Investors taken to the cleaners by Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange will probably be pleased to hear that the man who admittedly made a lot of ""mistakes"" that cost them their money is in police custody today on fraud and money laundering charges. He was arrested last night in his Bahamian headquarters at the request of US officials.  Sam Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify before Congress today, but he won't make that appointment. Bahamian police arrested the former cryptocurrency magnate on Monday night at the request of US authorities. Bankman-Fried will remain in custody in the Bahamas as he awaits extradition to the United States. ""S.B.F.'s arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against S.B.F. and is likely to request his extradition,"" said Bahamian officials. The New York Times reports that prosecutors confirmed that they had pressed charges against SBF in a sealed indictment to be opened later today. An anonymous source says the offenses include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering. The Securities and Exchange Commission said it will formally announce separate charges related to securities violations later today. The source says that SBF is the only suspect listed in the indictment. However, criminal conspiracy, by definition, always involves more than one person. Therefore we can expect more arrests if the insider's information is accurate. Bankman-Fried's fall from grace comes after a series of events that unfolded in a matter of days. The billionaire's crypto exchange, FTX, began floundering due to --- as SBF has put it --- ""bad decisions."" He had bailed out other crypto businesses and sunk a ton of money into advertising his FT Token (FTT). It got to the point where FTX needed a bailout.  Binance offered to buy FTX, but before the deal could be made formal, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into the exchange for potentially mishandling investors' deposits. The news caused FTT investors to panic resulting in a ""bank run"" that revealed an $8 billion deficit in FTT funds owed to investors. The total valuation of FTX virtual evaporated overnight. Investors were angry, and the US government wanted answers. Congress subpoenaed SBF to appear and testify about the collapse. His testimony was scheduled for today, Tuesday, December 13. However, on Monday, someone leaked a private group message thread between SBF, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Kraken exchange founder Jesse Powell, and Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino. The most newsworthy part of the conversation involved a heated argument between SBF and Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ) that saw the Binance chief accuse the FTX founder of market manipulation. Bankman-Fried flatly denied the allegation. ""I have made a number of mistakes over the past year but this is not one of them,"" SBF said in the conversation conducted via the encrypted messaging app Signal. Zhao also accused him of trying to ""depeg"" Tether and of making wreckless crypto trades in the wake of the FTX implosion that threatened to send the entire crypto industry into a ""meltdown,"" according to the Times. It is unclear if the revelation of this discussion was a catalyst for SBF's subsequent arrest, but the timing is about right. The SEC and prosecutors could have seen Bankman-Fried as a flight risk and issued the arrest warrant before he could traipse off to parts unknown where extradition would have been a problem.     8 comments  62 likes and shares    Share this article:                                Tech Jobs: Find the next step in your career    Related Stories    Microsoft and Amazon tip India's law enforcement on tech support call center fraudsters     Bitcoin surges to 18-month high, but GPU mining remains dead     FTX employees discovered customer wallet backdoor, but bosses ignored their warnings     Security firm claims it can unlock IronKey USB drive holding 7,000 Bitcoin hostage, but owner politely declines           Featured on TechSpot     PC CPUs are getting more interesting, and competition is coming       Google Fiber is now trialing 20 Gig residential internet        ",2022-12-13

Reuters cites four persons familiar with the matter.  Prosecutors in the United States Attorney’s Office in Seattle launched an investigation into Binance in 2018 after instances were recorded that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds. According to Reuters, Binance has been under investigation for possible money laundering and criminal sanctions violations. Splits between prosecutors from the Department of Justice have however been delaying the conclusion of this long-running investigation into the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Some of the half dozen federal prosecutors involved in the case believe that the evidence gathers thus far justifies moving forward and bringing action against Binance and some of its executives. Others in the department however are arguing to take more time to sufficiently review the evidence. The Justice Department’s investigation involves three offices: the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, and finally the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. According to the sources, Justice Department regulations stipulate that money laundering charges against a financial institution must be approved by the MLARS chief. Further, leaders from the two other offices, as well as higher-level DOJ officials, would also have to sign off on any action leveled against Binance. Prosecution Would Be Problematic for Crypto Industry The crypto industry finds itself in a very precarious position now. The sector has been plagued by negative news ever since the collapse of Binance’s rival exchange FTX in November. Should the investigation into Binance and Zhao continue and eventually lead to formal charges, it could loosen Binance’s grip on the industry which has strengthened tremendously since the demise of FTX. Defense attorneys for Binance at U.S. law firm Gibson Dunn have attended several meetings with Justice Department officials over the past couple of months according to people familiar with the matter. Binance has posited a couple of arguments which include the facts that a criminal prosecution would have a disastrous effect on the market which already finds itself in a prolonged downturn.   The investigation has focused on unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations. Although no final charging decisions have been made, prosecutors view Zhao and several executives to be the subject of these investigations. Should the investigation prove to be fruitful for the DOJ, the department may bring indictments against Binance and its executives, negotiate a settlement, or may close the case without taking any action against them at all.   Binance Denies Claims Made by DOJ Binance issued a statement in which it refuted the claims made in the Reuters article. Binance’s global head of intelligence and investigations, Tigran Gambaryan, said that the exchange has “responded to over 47,000 law enforcement requests” since November 2021. A spokesperson for Binance said:  As has been reported widely, regulators are doing a sweeping review of every crypto company against many of the same issues. This nascent industry has grown quickly and Binance has shown its commitment to security and compliance through large investments in our team as well as the tools and technology we use to detect and deter illicit activity.

Its website no longer works and social media accounts are inactive. The token technically still exists, in zombie form, as a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This year, the STO has taken another step toward oblivion: It has vanished from the pricing site CoinGecko, which lists nearly 13,000 cryptocurrencies that are still considered viable in some form.CoinGecko officials would not confirm when exactly Storeum was deactivated from its website. But a cursory search using the Wayback Machine, which archives websites from prior dates, shows that a Storeum token page was still active as of early 2022. Now, typing Storeum into CoinGecko’s search bar turns up no results.Call it a dead coin.During the crypto bull market of recent years, the number of cryptocurrencies seemed to be ever-increasing, roughly quadrupling from 2019 through early 2022, based on data from the website Statista. Since peaking at 10,397 in February 2022, the number has dropped by about 1,000, the biggest-ever decline in the 13-year-old crypto industry’s volatile history.“It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token,” said Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko. “But these tokens can obviously lose interest extremely quickly.”Just as STO arrived during an earlier crypto bull-market hype cycle, a bevy of tokens appeared last year as bitcoin (BTC) – the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market value, often viewed as an industry bellwether – shot to a record $69,000.According to CoinGecko, which uses a different methodology from Statista’s, over 8,000 cryptocurrencies were newly listed in 2021, but some 3,300 of them, or roughly 41%, ended up being deactivated and delisted.“During this period, many cryptocurrency projects, tokens and coins with little to no value or any immediate or discernible purpose were launched by various anonymous developers,” Julia Ng, growth marketing at CoinGecko, wrote in a recent analysis. “Few were actually committed to their projects, which resulted in a high rate of failure, and thus their ultimate demise.”Tokens might be removed from the site due to a lack of any discernible trading activity within the last two months, based on CoinGecko's methodology. A coin might also be taken off CoinGecko if it's deemed to be a ""rug pull"" or other scams, or if the project team requests a deactivation.""This might occur when the team disbands, rebrands, shutters the project, or undergo major token overhauls where old tokens become sufficiently illiquid or dead, according to CoinGecko standards,"" Ng wrote.Chart shows the number of deactivated cryptocurrencies on CoinGecko, by year listed. (CoinGecko)The overall crypto market’s capitalization has shrunk from an all-time high of $3 trillion in November 2021 to about $850 billion now. Bitcoin’s price has fallen 66% over the past year and ether (ETH) is down 71%.Kaiko’s Carey estimated that the number of failed tokens could be “significantly higher in the past two years” because of the explosion in 2017 in the number of ERC-20 tokens – a type that’s easy to mint and runs atop the Ethereum blockchain.“It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token and an associated decentralized exchanges [DEX] liquidity pool,” Carey told CoinDesk. “If no one is providing liquidity, there will be little or no trading volume.”.Rug pullBesides losing buyers’ interests, some token failures could be associated with scams, according to Chainalysis Director of Research Kim Grauer.One of the more common schemes, referred to in the gallows-humor jargon of crypto traders as the “rug pull,” involves “creating a token, funding the liquidity pool, and then removing all the liquidity after an initial rush of people buy the token,” as Carey describes it.As is the case with Storeum, the contract behind the token remains on the blockchain; the data is still there, for posterity, even when the token has gone dormant and is long forgotten. Etherscan, a data explorer for the Ethereum blockchain, shows no transactions have occurred for 231 days.A warning notice on the Etherscan page reads, ""Warning! There are reports that this token used a fake team profile on their website. Please exercise caution when interacting with this token.""At one point, back in 2019, there was chatter on the forum bitcointalk.org that the Storeum project might be a ""scam hitting on all cylinders,"" including speculation that team members were ginned up using artificial intelligence.Chainalysis’s Grauer told CoinDesk that “it is difficult for a token to totally ‘die’ because the code keeps the project running even without buyers.”The existence of dead coins points up a key paradox of the crypto industry, according to Kaiko's Carey: Decentralization, often portrayed as a pillar of virtue, can proves to be little more than an illusion. Just like the fast growth.It's “decentralization, in that the bar to creating tokens has been dramatically lowered in recent years,” Carey said. It's “centralization, in that many of these tokens or projects relied on one or a few individuals to provide liquidity and keep the project alive. Centralized exchanges are well within their right to remove tokens with little or no trading volume, as they won’t contribute to revenue and likely entail some cost to upkeep.”Some tokens might be better off dead.",2022-12-13

He said that while only Bankman-Fried had been charged so far, “we are not done”.On Monday, police in the Bahamas arrested Bankman-Fried after receiving formal notification from the US of criminal charges against him. Bankman-Fried was denied bail Tuesday by a judge in the Bahamas, after a prosecutor said he was a flight risk, the New York Times reported.Among other charges, Bankman-Fried is accused of using FTX customers’ deposits to pay debts and expenses to Alameda Research, his hedge fund. The indictment also alleges that Bankman-Fried and others conspired to violate federal rules on political donations.Bankman-Fried was one of the Democrats’ largest donors, but he has said he also gave to Republicans, hiding the donations as “dark money”. Other FTX entities gave cash to both parties as they lobbied politicians for favourable cryptocurrency regulation.Bankman-Fried’s fortune was valued at $26bn (£21bn) before his company’s collapse. He and FTX were generous donors to media groups, charities and politicians, giving at least $95,000 to politicians now investigating FTX, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.Politicians expressed dismay and anger at the scale of the mess at a hearing of the House financial services committee on Tuesday. FTX’s new chief executive, John Ray III, said he had “never seen such an utter lack of record keeping” at a company.Story continuesThere were “absolutely no internal controls whatsoever”, said Ray, who has 40 years of experience overseeing some of the world’s biggest bankruptcies, including the collapse of the energy firm Enron. Asked to compare the cases, Ray said Enron’s criminals were “highly sophisticated” whereas FTX executives had engaged in “old-fashioned embezzlement”.The Democratic representative Brad Sherman told the hearing: “My fear is that people will look at Sam Bankman-Fried as one snake in a garden of Eden. But the fact is, crypto is a garden of snakes.”Bankman-Fried had been scheduled to appear before the committee but was unable to do so because of his arrest. In his testimony, Bankman-Fried planned to open by telling Congress: “I fucked up.”The Democratic representative Emanuel Cleaver called the testimony “absolutely insulting. I mean, there’s not a person up here would like to show this to their children.”The SEC charged Bankman-Fried with “orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX”. It said: “Investigations as to other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.”The SEC said Bankman-Fried concealed his diversion of FTX customers’ funds to Alameda Research while raising more than $1.8bn from investors, including about $1.1bn from about 90 US-based investors.Related: Sam Bankman-Fried has been arrested. What happens next to the FTX founder?“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, said on Tuesday. “The alleged fraud committed by Mr Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.”The SEC further alleges that Bankman-Fried used FTX customer funds, commingled with Alameda’s own capital, “to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations”.Unusually, Bankman-Fried has been discussing the collapse of FTX publicly even while investigations are ongoing. In a conversation with Bloomberg’s Zeke Faux in late November, he listed $6.5bn of losses from FTX and Alameda, resulting in the insolvency of both companies, including “$250m for real estate, $1.5bn for expenses, $4bn for venture capital investments, $1.5bn for acquisitions and $1bn labelled ‘fuck-ups’”.This month he told a conference in New York: “Look, I screwed up.” But he maintained he “didn’t ever try to commit fraud” and said he was “shocked” by the collapse of his businesses.Mark Cohen, a lawyer for Bankman-Fried, said in a statement that his client “is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options”.",2022-12-13

A 0.1 per cent monthly increase (not the 0.3 expected) decelerated the overall yearly rate to 7.1 per cent from 7.8 per cent.These figures will certainly have a part to play in tomorrow’s Federal Reserve rate decision, as equities fluctuated while digesting the news.At one point, the S&P 500 traded as high at +2.4 per cent but had moved back at the time of writing, to trade +0.1 per cent at the time of writing while the Nadsaq moved in the same direction, rising 0.2 per cent.

Airlines were also amongst the underperformers of Wednesday morning. American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Airlines all lost 6.5, 5.6 and 5.2 per cent, respectively.News from aircraft manufacturer Boeing included its monthly deliveries number of 48 planes in November up from 35 in October but excluding United’s large 100+ Dreamliner order announced on Tuesday. Rest of the world AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Asian stocks were mixed overnight as the Shanghai Composite fell a mild 0.1 per cent while both the of Nikkei and Hang Seng landed in the green. The Hang Seng’s move could be widely attributed to newly appointed chief executive John Lee announcing further easing of Covid-19 restrictions, doing away with its Covid-19 tracing app while also allowing international travellers back into bars and restaurants without constraints.  Commodities Commodities moved higher as gold and silver had both risen 1.5 per cent at the time of writing. Oil also surged another 3.9 per cent, trading with news of the continued closure of the US keystone pipeline, a vital link transporting energy from oil-rich Canada to the US. In the wake of the well-publicised collapse of crypto exchange FTX, founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas. This is the first move by regulators to hold certain individuals accountable for the multi-billion dollar fall of FTX in November, which could further damage confidence amongst the wider suite of crypto currencies.Despite this, crypto traded higher with the lighter US inflation reading with increases in both Bitcoin (+3.4 per cent) and Ethereum (+4.2 per cent). New ZealandThe NZX 50 moved 0.8 per cent higher to 11,601 points during Tuesday’s trading.

Shielded from a cold November night, partygoers indulged in an open bar lit up by the blue, green and red strobe lights pulsing through the makeshift club. Following performances by Beck, Chris Rock and Aziz Ansari, the main event of the evening was a set by The Strokes. Wylie Aronow was swaying with his girlfriend as they listened to the acclaimed New York rock band. She turned to him and uttered three surreal words: ""You did this."" Just a year prior, Aronow was living ""bed to bathroom"" with colitis, a disease that can cause chronic inflammation along the digestive tract. The illness forced him to drop out of college and caused him to languish for much of his 20s. Now Aronow is better known as Gordon Goner, one of the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT phenomenon.Along with the three other founders -- Gargamel (Greg Solano), Emperor Tomato Ketchup (Kerem Atalay) and No Sass (Zeshan Ali) -- he'd organized the show everyone was watching. They'd also gotten help from Guy Oseary, the famed manager of Madonna and U2, who signed a deal to represent BAYC the month prior. It was Nov. 4, 2021. The Bored Ape Yacht Club was scarcely seven months old. The concert concluded the final day of Ape Fest, a string of activities taking place in New York, tailored for holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which are crypto tokens that prove ownership of a digital item. Earlier events included a yacht party and an art gallery featuring NFTs from the collection. For many, that week signaled the Bored Ape Yacht Club's transformation from an online curiosity to a tangible subculture. ""It's only in those moments of taking a break that you see how much your life has changed,"" Aronow said in an interview. ""It just hit me so hard.""            Enlarge Image                Bored Ape Yacht Club founders Zeshan Ali (red Hawaiian shirt), Kerem Atalay (green hoodie), Wylie Aronow (charcoal T-shirt, red shirt) and Greg Solano (black hoodie). Yuga Lab's CEO, Nicole Muniz, is in the center.  Yuga LabsThe Bored Ape Yacht Club has grown bigger than anyone could have possibly predicted. Aronow says he initially envisioned BAYC as a Web3 version of the streetwear brand Supreme. It's grown into something drastically more ambitious, mixing apparel, live events and an upcoming video game. Yuga Labs, the company the four founders formed to launch the Bored Ape Yacht Club, now has over 100 employees, and is valued at $4 billion.Blockchain technologies like crypto and NFTs form the basis of Web3, the supposed next generation of the internet that seeks to take control of the internet away from major platforms like Amazon, Meta and Google. But detractors say that Web3 and all of its components, NFTs and crypto chief among them, are merely Ponzi schemes, that the battered valuations of bitcoin and ether represent years of hype finally making contact with reality.In an area where scams and fraudsters are ubiquitous — see the recent collapse of the FTX exchange and its disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried — Yuga Labs aims to prove that Web3 can not only be legitimate, but is in fact the future.""There's a Satoshi Nakamoto quote, 'If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you,'"" said Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano, aka Gargamel, referencing bitcoin's pseudonymous founder. ""I think that's the wrong attitude. I understand that people don't understand it. We want to build the roads, the infrastructure, that makes this inherently fun."" In the past 20 months, the Bored Ape Yacht Club has become the poster child of NFTs. Though far from their all-time high, the cheapest BAYC NFT on sale costs around $88,000, making it a hard club for newcomers to easily join. Even Yuga's secondary NFT collection designed to be more accessible, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, has a base price of just under $19,000. To create a more achievable entry point, Yuga Labs is looking to the metaverse, building a crypto-integrated game it hopes will help usher in the next generation of Web3 adopters.It won't be easy.  The Bored Ape and the bear marketIt's a bad time to be in crypto right now. Really bad. 2022 saw bitcoin and ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, plunge precipitously from their November 2021 all-time highs. Ether, the cryptocurrency on which much of the NFT world relies, is down more than 70% from its peak.The pain inflicted by the so-called crypto winter is felt far beyond the blood-red color that dominates year-over-year price graphs. The implosion of the Terra stablecoin in May wiped billions from the market, causing some ordinary people to lose extraordinary amounts of money. Things have only gotten worse since then.November saw the bankruptcy of FTX, a crypto exchange once worth over $26 billion which earlier this year participated in Yuga Labs' latest funding round. The job of an exchange like FTX is to buy and hold cryptocurrencies ordered by its customers. How that mandate resulted in $8 billion of debt exemplifies many of the worst parts about cryptocurrency: limited accountability taken advantage of by shady founders, leading to spectacular crashes. In October, Bankman-Fried, better known as SBF, was one of crypto's most trusted faces. His fall from grace has inflicted enormous harm on crypto's already beleaguered reputation. Calls for regulation have been amplified, most notably by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who warned that an unfettered crypto industry could tank the economy.""There's extraordinary regulatory scrutiny right now, and it's only going to get worse,"" said John Reed Stark, former chief of the Office of Internet Enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission and current president of John Reed Stark Consulting. ""I don't think any company that I've ever seen [in crypto] has the maturity or the wherewithal to be capable of handling that kind of regulation.""Yuga Labs is one of many companies the SEC looking at as it investigates the wider industry. Its challenge is not only to make Web3 accessible, but to do so at a time when both scrutiny and skepticism in all things crypto are greater than ever before.""Yuga isn't impacted by anything that's happened directly, but what's happened is horrible and I think hurts the entire industry,"" Aronow said of FTX's collapse. ""This was something that a large portion of the space trusted, thought was a good guy, and now we're seeing behind that mask, and it's ugly.""All Yuga Labs can do now, he said, is focus on its priorities. Its next key project is Otherside, Yuga's concept of the metaverse. While Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, sees the metaverse as a big virtual-reality world, Yuga Labs is going in the opposite direction. To bring in the largest group of people possible, Otherside is being designed to work on web browsers — both PC and mobile. Like World of Warcraft, a game Aronow and Solano have sunk countless hours into, Otherside will be a large fantasy world with quests and a storyline. But it'll also double as a platform, like Roblox and Minecraft, where players often spend time building, roaming and just hanging out. In both Minecraft and Roblox, a large part of the virtual locales players spend time in is built by players and companies, like Nikeland in Roblox, not the game's developers themselves. The difference between these established games and Otherside is the concept of digital ownership. Items you buy or make, unlike in Roblox or games like Fortnite, are treated like digital property — you can sell them, swap them or gift them once you're done.Gamers have thus far proven to be an unexpectedly tough sell on Web3. Though gaming is an obvious next step for NFT technology, gamers have reacted with fury at various studios' attempts to integrate NFTs into their wares. That can be chalked up to both a suspicion of NFTs as well as a history of predatory microtransaction tactics by established gaming companies. Ubisoft, Square Enix and EA have all faced the wrath of disapproving gamers, but Yuga Labs is betting that people will come around once they experience actual digital ownership.""People spend $120 billion each year on digital assets and games on their phone, and those are sunk-cost systems,"" Solano said. Once that money goes in, it can't come out. A proposed purpose of Web3 technology is to change that.           Enlarge Image                Otherside is Yuga Labs' upcoming metaverse game, developed for PC and mobile browsers. Yuga LabsYuga's proposition is that Otherside can use crypto and NFTs to form an in-game economy that would otherwise be impossible. Items created in the game can be owned as NFTs. Selling those NFTs, or creating in-game services people use, can earn you crypto. The idea isn't to create a playground for get-rich-quick schemes, but to develop a platform where people have the same financial incentives to create a digital item as a physical item.""There's a base idea here, which is you want to incentivize creators,"" Solano said. ""The best things that have come out of gaming in the past 20 years or so, much of it is mods and user-generated content and stuff that they can't monetize directly on their own, [so creators are] forced away to go to Patreon."" Solano is referring to games like Skyrim, which have enthusiastic modding communities that are over a decade old, and Dota, a full game that's actually a mod of Warcraft III. One of the most critically acclaimed games of 2021 was Forgotten City, a mod of Skyrim. Aronow and Solano couldn't give a firm release date for Otherside, insisting rather that the platform will open up incrementally. Adopting the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency, it'll be built alongside its community, with regular ""Voyager Trips"" — closed betas — informing how it's built. Crucially, despite it being a Web3 game, you won't need crypto or NFTs to play it. ""Otherside is very much an open platform and an open world,"" said Yuga Labs acting CEO Nicole Muniz, ""because we're looking at the entire ecosystem, and we want to onboard the next 100 million users onto Web3.""Muniz will step down as CEO in the first half of 2022, replaced by Activision Blizzard's departing president and COO, Daniel Alegre. Otherside is ambitious, and its success is far from assured. But Yuga's efforts are worth paying attention to. The speculative bubble that has enveloped the NFT space for much of the past two years has aroused fierce debate over whether there's any actual, mainstream use to the technology. Whichever way it goes, Yuga's metaverse bet will prove someone right.           Enlarge Image                Six CryptoKitties. CryptoKittiesThe world's first ethereum gameNFTs have been linked to gaming almost since their very inception. In November 2017, amid the mania of bitcoin approaching $20,000 for the first time, a firm called Axiom Zen launched an app called CryptoKitties on ethereum. It was billed as the world's first ethereum game.CryptoKitties allowed people to own cartoon cats as tokens on the blockchain. Among the first notable NFT collections, it posed the question: If currency can be owned as tokens on a blockchain, why not digital assets? CryptoKitties was a proof-of-concept experiment, but calling it a ""game"" is a stretch. Axiom Zen allowed around 35,000 CryptoKitties to be minted in the year following the app's launch. If you bought two, you could breed them to create a third CryptoKitty. What a kitty looked like depended on the traits of its parents. Some traits were rarer than others, making some CryptoKitties more valuable than others. At its height, CryptoKitties was popular enough to crash the ethereum blockchain, which wasn't efficient enough to deal with the transaction demand. But interest died off after a few months. ""I bought a couple [CryptoKitties] back in 2017, but it was kind of this blip,"" said Solano. ""It captured crypto Twitter for a moment, everyone was talking about it when it came out, then the model just wasn't there. … I kind of just forgot about it."" Solano had only been into crypto for a few months when CryptoKitties launched, having invested a few hundred dollars in ethereum alongside his brother-in-law on a whim in autumn 2017. Curious about cryptocurrency, Solano joked that he ""put the hook in"" Aronow, knowing that Aronow, once sufficiently titillated by a new idea, would tirelessly research the topic and ""crush you with all the stuff he dug up about it.""Aronow's propensity for falling down rabbit holes, for immersing himself in various virtual worlds, is in large degree related to his battle with colitis. He dropped out of college due to the disease, and said he spent much of the next decade stuck at home.""There were periods of peaks and valleys, times where I was more than capable of going outside,"" he explained. ""But for the vast majority of that, I was bed to bathroom.""It was only in early 2021 that Aronow's condition abated, which he chalks up to a combination of Western medicine, alternative medicine and diet. It was almost exactly three months after he started feeling better, Aronow said, when he got a text message from Solano: ""Hey, wanna make an NFT?""           Enlarge Image                Sixteen of the 10,000 CryptoPunks. The NFT collection launched in 2017 for free. They now regularly sell for six figures.  Yuga LabsThe NFT playbookCryptoKitties aroused a huge amount of attention for a few months, but the longterm NFT success story of 2017 was CryptoPunks. Launched for free by Larva Labs in 2017, it's a collection of 10,000 pixelated avatars that's considered the first profile-picture (PFP)   collection. It's famous for encoding traits into the tokens — different hairstyles, accessories and clothing — making some more valuable than others. In many ways it wrote the playbook followed by NFT creators four years later. Most NFT volume comes from such PFP collections, and most of those collections feature around 10,000 pieces.Aronow and Solano were inspired by CryptoPunks, and followed many of its cues. But in creating the Bored Ape Yacht Club, they ended up writing the NFT playbook's second edition. BAYC boasted a few key differences from other early 2021 projects. For instance, every Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT costs 0.08 ether, about $230. At the time, so-called ""bonding curves"" were in fashion, where the price of minting an NFT went up as more were sold. In one egregious example, the first NFTs cost 0.1 ether to mint, while the last cost 100 ether. The Bored Ape Yacht Club also came with a roadmap. While CryptoPunks began and ended with art, BAYC promised prolonged benefits to owning the NFT: merch drops, access to games and more. Last and perhaps most crucially, buying a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT also meant buying the IP for that ape. The most famous example is actor Seth Green, who's working on a sitcom featuring his ape. One BAYC owner used their simian as a mascot for a burger restaurant (Bored and Hungry), while a pair of friends bought an ape and, creating a backstory for it, turned it into an author, writing a whole book (Bored and Dangerous) in character. Just this month Adidas used its ape, who it named Indigo Herz, in its World Cup advertisement.            Enlarge Image                Adidas' Bored Ape, Indigo Herz, had a cameo in the company's recent World Cup 2022 ad.  AdidasHolders of Bored Ape NFTs are incentivized to use their ape to expand the brand. The more that image is spread, the more valuable, in theory, the NFTs become. That's good for holders and for Yuga Labs, which takes a 2.5% cut from every BAYC NFT sold. Whether this works in the long term is anyone's guess, but it's a type of crowdsourced marketing that only exists in NFTs right now.What didn't take off, however, was the feature that Aronow and Solano actually built the Bored Ape Yacht Club around.When they agreed to ""do an NFT,"" among the duo's first ideas was an NFT that would grant access to a shared canvas. The hope was that a community could form around an artwork everyone contributed a piece to — an idea Muniz, a longtime friend of Aronow who at the time was advising the pair, called ""special"" and ""a little pretentious.""Muniz sensibly guessed that the first thing anyone would do is draw a dick on the canvas, and encouraged Solano and Aronow to work backward from that presumption. The shared canvas eventually became the bathroom wall of a dive bar. That dive bar eventually became part of a yacht club. That yacht club eventually became located in an Everglades swamp, in homage to the pair's Miami upbringing. The yacht club would be populated by apes, cartoonishly embodying the crypto slang ""ape,"" an affectionate term for investing money without doing any due diligence first: ""I just aped into this coin. I have no idea what it does.""  The ""bored"" part was inspired by crypto Twitter. The pair became fascinated by crypto traders they knew to be worth millions who would spend all their time shitposting on the platform.""There was something deeply fascinating about someone who would post all day about cryptocurrency, and just have like a cat profile picture or whatever, who you could cryptographically verify was worth millions and millions of dollars, and late at night they would be like, 'Who wants to play League of Legends with me? I'm bored,'"" Aronow said.Solano and Aronow paid five artists to design the ape traits. These would be fed into an algorithm, which then generated the 10,000 cartoon primate avatars the world has come to know and love/hate. Two friends, Zeshan Ali and Kerem Atalay, were brought on to write smart contracts and handle the tech side of things. Ali and Atalay are Yuga Labs' other two founders. The upfront cost of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT launch was about $40,000. Months later, after it had become an unexpected success, each of the five artists got paid an additional $1 million for their work. (Seneca, the lead designer, contends her payment was ""not ideal."")Buying an ape would come with the ultimate enticement: the ability to add a pixel to the club's dive-bar bathroom wall every 15 minutes. ""As absurd as it is,"" Solano said, ""that was our way of pushing the space forward at the time.""The bathroom wall collage never took off — but the collection sold out in under 24 hours, generating $2.3 million for Yuga Labs.           Enlarge Image                Ape Fest 2022: One of many Bored Ape holders to get a tattoo of their ape.  Yuga LabsBored Ape summer                                   Josh Ong bought a Bored Ape during the collection's opening sale, paying $235 plus a $15 transaction fee. He still holds it — as I look on OpenSea now, there's an offer on Ong's ape for $85,000. Ong, who's known for wearing the same Hawaiian shirt that his ape dons, said he was curious about the idea of crypto tokens granting access to online communities, and liked the BAYC art enough to drop 0.08 ether on it. The Bored Ape Yacht Club collection did well in the months following launch. Its floor price, which is measured by the cheapest any owner has their NFT listed for, fluctuated between $3,000 and $15,000 until July. But, Ong recalls, it really got going that August when Steph Curry bought an ape for $150,000. Not only did the NBA star use his NFT as a profile picture on Twitter, where he has 17 million followers, he joined and chatted with other holders in the group's Discord, the messaging platform on which most NFT activity occurs.Many more celebrities would buy into the Bored Ape Yacht Club and use their NFTs as a profile picture, including Justin Bieber, Timbaland and Gwyneth Paltrow. Not all of the attention celebrities drummed up for the BAYC brand was positive. A January segment on the Tonight Show featured host Jimmy Fallon comparing his Bored Ape with Paris Hilton's. The interaction was mocked online, and some like Stark criticized it as an example of market manipulation.Still, the higher the Bored Ape Yacht Club's floor price rose, the more celebrities flaunted their apes on social media, the more owning an NFT came to resemble an actual elite club pass. The day after Curry bought his ape, Yuga dropped the Mutant Ape Yacht Club. All BAYC holders were gifted a vial of mutant serum. That serum could be saved or could be used on their existing Bored Ape to create a new Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT.           Enlarge Image                A Bored Ape on the left, a Mutant Ape on the right.  Yuga LabsThe Mutant Ape Yacht Club was designed to both reward holders and to make the brand more accessible. By that time, the Bored Ape floor had risen to a level that made it prohibitively expensive even for those deeply convinced of the future of NFTs. The MAYC collection consisted of 20,000 NFTs: 10,000 from vials airdropped to BAYC holders, and 10,000 that were sold to the public. The public sale was a Dutch auction starting at 3 ether, or about $9,000. It sold out almost immediately, netting Yuga Labs another $96 million.Around that time, Ong held one of the first offline Bored Ape Yacht Club meetups. It was a small affair: A few friends he'd met in the group's Discord were going to be in New York for an NBA game. They thought about ways to market the Bored Ape Yacht Club, ways to bring the disparate community together. Ong organized two more meetups before thinking big: an actual yacht party.Ong got the founders on a Zoom call. ""We had this crazy idea to throw an actual yacht party at NFT.NYC [in November],"" he told them. ""And if Yuga wants to be involved, if you wanna put up some money…""""They looked at each other, they'd just finished the Mutant mint, and said, 'I think we can cover the bill.'""The idea turned into Ape Fest, a party that for the past two years has taken place concurrently with the NFT.NYC convention. In 2021, Ape Fest consisted of a yacht party, an open gallery featuring artwork from the Bored and Mutant Ape collections, and the Strokes-headlined Brooklyn warehouse party to cap it all off. The founders were unsure about how much demand there would be, how possible it would be to transfer energy from Discord to real life. When they arrived at the gallery space where Ape Fest wristbands were being given out on day one, they found a line wrapped around four city blocks. Solano helped give out wristbands. Because the founders were still pseudonymous, most people assumed he was venue staff — someone even asked if he was a Yuga intern. Later, Ong recalls, when artworks were being set up in the gallery, Aronow entered the room to help, but was blocked by security.""He got bounced from his own event,"" Ong chuckled.Doxxed Ape Yacht ClubAronow and Solano made the decision to remain pseudonymous at Ape Fest 2021, not making their real identities as BAYC founders known. Looking back, they now say they were ""overthinking it.""For better or worse, pseudonymity is a foundational feature of Web3 culture. The Bored Ape founders originally ""doxxed"" themselves after discovering that a BuzzFeed reporter who'd uncovered Aronow's and Solano's identities intended to publish a story about them.Got doxxed against my will. Oh well.Web2 me vs. Web3 me pic.twitter.com/uLkpsJ5LvN— GordonGoner.eth (Wylie Aronow) (@GordonGoner) February 5, 2022 Got doxed so why not. Web2 me vs Web3 me. pic.twitter.com/jfmzo5NtrH— Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 5, 2022 Bad actors frequently use the pseudonymity that's accepted in Web3 for ill ends. Sketchy founders are able to create a project, be it a cryptocurrency or an NFT collection, make money, vanish before fulfilling whatever utility they promised, and then repeat the process. I asked Muniz, Yuga's current CEO, if pseudonymity becomes a liability for a company with the size and mainstream ambition of Yuga. ""We really think of Yuga as an experiment on Web3 values,"" Muniz said. Web3 isn't just about owning your digital assets, she said, but owning your identity too. It's a principle applied to both the products Yuga makes and the way the company itself runs. ""We have people on staff that are fully pseudonymous, I don't know their real name. I could, as CEO, go to HR and say, 'I wanna know this person's name,' but I would never do that. … The 'real identity' thing, I can't speak to what other people are doing, but I do think people should have that choice. You should be able to own your identity."" Aronow and Solano rejected the suggestion that there was anything untoward about their pseudonymity. ""Number one, three months before we ever launched the collection, we were an LLC registered in Delaware and the state of Virginia,"" Solano said. ""We were never hiding, we were just pseudonymous. We were just interacting in a way that frankly is very natural in the space and very natural to what a lot of people of our generation that have grown up playing MMORPGs, or living on AIM."" Welp, here we go...Hey, I'm Zeshan.

The wisdom of the accepting the practice was questioned in May when the founder of a popular collection, Azuki, was discovered to have started and abandoned two previous NFT projects. ""I wouldn't trust anyone who's not doxxed,"" a former Pixar designer-turned-NFT creator told me at NFT.NYC in June. The Bored Ape founders were doxxed for four months by the time of NFT.NYC 2022, and would no longer be confused as interns. Yuga's founders spent Ape Fest 2022 in June being crowded by community members eager for selfies and autographs. Their personal space wasn't the only thing more crowded that year. Ape Fest was another example of the NFT industry at large following Yuga's path. At NFT.NYC 2022, NFT brands competed with one another to host the biggest party with the most famous guests. Madonna performed at World of Women's NFT.NYC party, while Doodles' show featured an announcement that Pharrell Williams was coming on as chief brand officer, which preceded a performance by The Chainsmokers. Meanwhile, Ape Fest 2022 turned into an actual music festival, with four days of performances by the likes of Lil' Wayne, LCD Soundystem and The Roots. It was headlined by Eminem and Snoop Dogg debuting a music video in which they transform into their Bored Apes.            Enlarge Image                Ape Fest 2022 was headlined by Eminem and Snoop Dogg debuting a new video featuring their Bored Apes.  Yuga LabsBuilding the clubWhen Aronow and I first spoke, I asked him what he thought about the wave of NFTs making promises they were never actually going to keep. Various collections have claimed improbable goals of disrupting fashion, fitness and gaming. In response, he told me about DentaCoin.In the 2017 crypto bull run, while he and Solano were on crypto Twitter every day, Aronow encountered a cryptocurrency called DentaCoin. It claimed it would forever change the dental industry through blockchain wizardry. It may have sounded plausible to the uninitiated but, to people in crypto, it was an obvious and absurd marketing tactic. ""There's a lot of feasibility for the future use cases of NFTs, but with every bull run comes the DentaCoin,"" Aronow said. ""There's always the people who are going to try and take advantage of a situation, and it may not be easy for the public to suss out what's legitimate and what's not."" There were dozens of NFT collections being pumped out each day in the months following Bored Ape Yacht Club's success. Few register on anyone's radar. I asked the Bored Ape founders how much of their success could be chalked up to being at the right place at the right time. There was a brief moment of silence.""We didn't sleep at all afterwards,"" Solano said of the period following the April 2021 BAYC launch. ""We spent that whole summer, and eight months later, working 14 hours a day."" It was nearly 8 p.m ET and the sound of Slack notifications popping off was easily audible in Solano's background. Aronow added: ""Within a few months of selling out, we were in Garga's mom's backyard in the middle of the summer heat, packaging up hats and T-shirts, figuring out how to fulfill merch orders, in the middle of COVID. ""And then, shortly after that, throwing a giant festival on a yacht and a giant Brooklyn warehouse. I hadn't worked in a decade, Greg was a book publisher, Zeshan and Tomato were software engineers, and we were figuring out how to throw major concerts months after selling out the collection,"" Aronow said. ""You make your own luck."" Despite helming the most lucrative NFT collections, Aronow and Solano insist the grind of building a company — of working 14 hours a day, every day — means not much has changed. It's only during the occasional break, like watching The Strokes play at a gig you organized, that it hits you.""It's probably been much more surreal for my wife than it has been for myself,"" Solano said. ""She'll overhear a conference call and be like, 'Was that so-and-so? That's crazy, you're talking to these people,' and I'm just like, 'I don't know, I gotta get to the next meeting.'"" If anything in life has changed, Solano says, ""it's just a shitload more Uber Eats."" Web3 DisneyYuga Labs has conquered the NFT world. The Bored Ape Yacht Club is the second biggest NFT collection of all time, and Mutant Apes the third. The only collection to surpass BAYC is CryptoPunks, buoyed by its historical significance as the first notable NFT set.And in March of this year Yuga Labs bought CryptoPunks, the ranked No. 1 in trading volume of any NFT collection ever, off Larva Labs, along with another popular collection in Meebits, ranked No. 11.""I like to use the analog of Web3 Disney,"" said Muniz, who was appointed Yuga Labs CEO in February of 2022. BAYC is Yuga Labs' Mickey Mouse, Muniz explained, while CryptoPunks and Meebits are the company's equivalent of the Star Wars and Marvel acquisitions. Otherside, the metaverse platform Yuga is building, is like its Disney World.            Enlarge Image                Of the 10 top NFT collections of all time, Yuga Labs owns 5: CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Otherdeed for Otherside and Meebits. OpenSeaI asked if there's any contradiction in a Web3 company owning a set of collections that are responsible for between 30% and 40% of the market volume.""This is where we're not like Disney,"" Muniz answered. ""We might own 30% to 40% of the market, but also our holders own 30% to 40% of the market, and I mean that in an IP sense. Our collections are some of the only collections that truly give away IP rights. … You have exclusive commercial IP rights, and that also means, by the way, Yuga does not."" She brought up the example of the art galleries at Ape Fest, which showcase various Bored and Mutant Apes. In each case, Muniz said, they had to ask for the holder's permission to use the ape. When Adidas put its ape, Indigo Herz, in its World Cup ad, Solano said, they didn't need to ask Yuga Labs first. ""The biggest condition for us doing that deal is that we would be able to decentralize the intellectual property,"" Solano added. Prior to Yuga's acquisition, Larva Labs retained IP rights to CryptoPunks. ""That was the thing that was most important to us. That was the thing that underpinned our reasoning for all of this.""This success, as lucrative as it's thus far proven to be, is limited by its concentration on NFT circles. To grow from here, Yuga needs to onboard more people to NFT space — or make a product that appeals to people who would never buy an NFT. Otherside is designed to be the solution to both problems. A big birthday breakThe Bored Ape Yacht Club rang in its first birthday in a big way: by breaking ethereum. On April 30, 2022, Yuga hosted its biggest public sale yet when it launched its Otherdeed collection. Unlike the Bored and Mutant Ape collections, these NFTs aren't designed to be used as profile pictures. They're deeds for virtual land in Otherside.Buying an Otherdeed NFT comes with two benefits. First, holders are able to participate in Otherside's beta tests, give feedback and inform how the game is ultimately made. Second, once Otherside is live, the plot of land depicted in a holder's Otherdeed NFT will become theirs in the game.Yuga is still in the first of three development phases for Otherside, so can't confirm the precise parameters of land ownership. Other Web3 metaverses, like Sandbox, allow players to use their land to set up shops, farm resources, build accommodation, rent spaces out for events and host advertisements. In total, 55,000 Otherdeeds were sold, raising about $320 million for Yuga Labs. But ethereum proved unable to handle the load, and was inaccessible for about three hours. Many people paid $1,500 in fees for transactions that failed — meaning they were unable to mint their NFT — showcasing a glaring weakness of blockchain technology.            Enlarge Image                Four Otherdeed NFTs that represent plots of land in Otherside. There will eventually be 200,000 Otherdeed plots.  Yuga Labs""It's incredibly challenging,"" Solano said. ""We knew the right thing to do would be to reimburse people for lost gas fees, so that was a huge priority for us."" Yuga Labs paid $265,000 in refunds for people who paid ether for failed transactions. ""It's the insane level of demand we've experienced at different points, the same way when we had lines four ways around the block,"" Solano added. ""It's like, 'Wow, amazing, people want to come see this,' but also 'Fuck, we have lines four ways around the block.'"" Otherdeed holders — of which there are just under 34,000 — are sure to be excited about Yuga's metaverse. Overcoming the wider public's uncertainty, suspicion and resentment of NFTs will be the true test. Stark, the former SEC enforcer, questions whether the NFT space can untether itself from rampant speculation. ""Once you turn it into a marketplace it's no longer a place where people play the game, it's a place where everybody's trying to get cool stuff so they can sell it for more money,"" he said. ""If you want to flex with some really cool-looking cartoon character, that's your world, have at it. I think that's not the reality. … What everybody is selling is this notion that you're gonna get rich.""Yet in other areas where NFTs have historically been criticized, substantial progress has been made. A common, justifiable objection to the adoption of NFTs has been the enormous carbon footprint of ethereum, the blockchain on which most NFTs are built. But in September the blockchain adopted a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, changing the way new cryptocurrency is ""mined,"" lowering its carbon output by over 99%.  ""If that was truly where the reticence lied, that's now been solved,"" Solano said. ""Have feelings changed as drastically as the facts? Not yet."" Muniz is confident that the technology will eventually win people over, that we're still at the ""56k modem"" stage of Web3. Aronow is aware of the baggage that terms like ""NFT"" and ""metaverse"" come with, and says the names might eventually be changed to be more palatable to mainstream audiences. But regardless of the name, Aronow says that eventually people will see the inherent value of owning their digital goods.""It's only a matter of time before a company, hopefully ours, is going to demonstrate that value through a really fun game,"" he said. ""That's going to open the flood gates. There's no going back from that moment.""",2022-12-13

The controversial founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX was taken into custody in the Bahamas yesterday after criminal charges were filed against him by the United States Department of Justice. In a press conference today, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York said that Bankman-Fried is facing a total of eight criminal charges, including defrauding FTX customers, FTX investors, and lenders to sister company Alameda Research.The arrest has sparked jubilation in crypto circles, after some nail-biting over his ostensibly generous treatment by “mainstream media” and speculation (by Twitter CEO Elon Musk, no less) that his political donations may earn him a free pass of sorts with US law enforcement.However, the timing of the arrest—one day before Bankman-Fried was due to testify before Congress about the collapse of FTX—has raised eyebrows.Against the advice of his lawyers, Bankman-Fried has given a series of interviews since the collapse, but none have been particularly illuminating (with the exception of a Vox report that caught him off-guard). He has largely evaded straightforward questions, given tangential responses, and been generally inattentive—he played video games during at least one interview.But as pointed out by US representative Maxine Waters, the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, today’s hearing would have marked the first time Bankman-Fried had spoken under oath about the FTX debacle. In a statement, Waters said she was “surprised” to learn of the arrest. ""The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress,” she wrote, “and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.”Most PopularCultureTaylor Swift and Beyoncé Are Resurrecting the American Movie TheaterAngela WatercutterBusinessSam Bankman-Fried Built a Crypto Paradise in the Bahamas—Now He's a Bad MemoryJoel KhaliliScienceHere’s the Truth Behind the Biggest (and Dumbest) Battery MythsGrace BrowneGearThe Best iPhone 15 Cases and AccessoriesJulian ChokkattuIn addition to providing his own testimony, Bankman-Fried was also going to have to respond to testimony from John Ray III, the liquidation savant that stepped into his shoes as CEO of FTX on November 11, who was due to speak ahead of him.A written preview of Ray’s testimony, published in advance of the hearing, gave the first indication that Bankman-Fried was in for a rough ride. “Never in my career have I seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization,” wrote Ray, before describing Bankman-Fried and his inner circle as “grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated.” Although the particulars remain unclear, Ray confirmed that FTX customer deposits were mixed with funds held by sister company Alameda Research and used to fund risky trading activity, exposing FTX users to “massive losses.” He also explained that, contrary to Bankman-Fried’s repeated claims that FTX’s US division has always remained solvent, the offshoot “was not operated independently of FTX.com,” denting any remaining hopes that US-based customers will recover their funds in full. Bankman-Fried’s counsel did not respond to a request for comment.A leaked version of Bankman-Fried’s own preparations, obtained by Forbes, suggests his own testimony would have added plenty to the spectacle too. According to the document, Bankman-Fried was preparing to point the finger at least in part at rival exchange Binance, which the document claims played a role in triggering the run on the bank that led to the FTX collapse. Not only did Binance engage in a sustained smear campaign, the document suggests, it also “never intended” to follow through on a rescue package agreed upon on November 8, which precluded Bankman-Fried from speaking to other potential white knights.The document also treads over the same ground covered by Bankman-Fried in his parade of interviews. His argument has always been that, although there was a failure to pay sufficiently close attention to risk management, no deliberate fraud took place.  Securities attorney Aaron Kaplan says he thinks the timing of the arrest in relation to the congressional hearing was “interesting but coincidental”—a reflection only of the desire to prosecute Bankman-Fried as swiftly as possible and to the “fullest extent of the law.”But it is at least conceivable, says Richard Schulman, a litigator at law firm Duval and Stachenfeld, that the US government did not want to “take a chance” that Congress might extend some sort of immunity to Bankman-Fried in exchange for his testimony. By arranging for Bankman-Fried to be arrested in advance of his appearance, the Justice Department eliminated that possibility. Most PopularCultureTaylor Swift and Beyoncé Are Resurrecting the American Movie TheaterAngela WatercutterBusinessSam Bankman-Fried Built a Crypto Paradise in the Bahamas—Now He's a Bad MemoryJoel KhaliliScienceHere’s the Truth Behind the Biggest (and Dumbest) Battery MythsGrace BrowneGearThe Best iPhone 15 Cases and AccessoriesJulian ChokkattuBankman-Fried faces two sets of charges: criminal charges from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and civil charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Kaplan calls these the “two sides of a full-court press.”The SEC has charged Bankman-Fried with “a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX,” and the agency says investigations into other violations of securities law are “ongoing.” Garry Gensler, SEC chair, accused Bankman-Fried of building a “house of cards on a foundation of deception.”Max Dilendorf, a lawyer specializing in crypto cases, describes the criminal charges filed by the DOJ as “serious” and certain to carry a jail sentence of at least 20 years if proven. But for the many victims of the FTX collapse, the arrest of Bankman-Fried will mean precious little, says Dilendorf. While people who have lost money may take comfort in the knowledge that charges have now been filed, he says the arrest is just the start of what could be a years-long process leading up to trial.The complexity of the alleged fraud means the discovery period (in which relevant material is collated and reviewed) and deposition process “could take years,” Dilendorf says, during which time hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds will remain locked away. “It’ll be a very bloody case—very bloody.”",2022-12-13

… [+4596 chars]",Investing.com,"(Bloomberg) -- Criminal charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried swiftly followed the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse, but getting him to the US to face those charges could be another story. Bankman-Fried, who ran FTX from the Bahamas, was arrested there Monday night at the request of US authorities. His arrest marks a major development in the FTX saga, but the fact that it was on foreign soil adds an extra complication. Federal prosecutors have said they will seek his extradition, and Bankman-Fried will soon have to decide whether he returns to the US willingly or fights to stay in the Bahamas. In his first appearance since his arrest, Bankman-Fried, 30, told a Bahamian judge at an arraignment Tuesday that he wouldn’t waive his right to an extradition hearing. That leaves the door open for him to contest being sent to the US to face the charges unsealed earlier in the day by federal prosecutors in New York. Bankman-Fried was charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and several other counts for allegedly misappropriating billions of dollars in FTX customers funds for personal use and risky bets by sister trading house Alameda Research. He has denied knowingly committing fraud in numerous media interviews.  “Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” Mark Cohen, a lawyer for the FTX founder, said in a statement on Tuesday. If he does fight, there may be potential for him to drag things out. Many high-profile extradition battles have gone on for years. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was charged by US authorities in 2019 for publishing leaked government secrets but is still fighting extradition from the UK, largely on mental-health grounds. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada in 2018 at the request of the US government which accused her of conspiring to avoid US sanctions on Iran. She fought extradition to the US until September 2021, when she was released under a non-prosecution deal with the Justice Department. Meng’s case had political and diplomatic dimensions Bankman-Fried’s lacks. The Chinese government vociferously objected to her arrest and took two Canadians living in China into custody in response — they were released shortly after she was. But her legal arguments also prolonged the case. She focused on the US-Canada extradition treaty’s requirement that the charged offense be a crime in both jurisdictions, arguing that violating US sanctions wasn’t illegal in Canada. The US-Bahamas extradition treaty has a similar “double criminality” requirement, and lawyers can parse statutes extremely closely to distinguish between two nations’ definitions of a crime.  Czech-born businessman Viktor Kozeny successfully fought extradition from the Bahamas on US charges that he orchestrated a scheme to bribe Azerbaijani officials in return for rights to buy the country’s state oil company. A local court found that Kozeny’s alleged bribes occurred before the Bahamas joined the Inter American Convention Against Corruption and therefore weren’t crimes in the country at the time. “Extradition law can be rather arcane,” said Douglas McNabb, a Houston lawyer who specializes in extradition cases. He said there were a number of experts in the area in Bahamas, though their experience is mainly in drug-trafficking cases.  Eight men facing US drug charges managed to put off extradition from the Bahamas for 11 years before they were finally sent to Florida in 2015. Among the arguments they employed against extradition was that one of the judge who heard the case had been subject to a mandatory retirement page. Bruce Zagaris, a Washington lawyer, said one reason extraditions from the Bahamas can drag on is that the British Commonwealth country sends final appeals to the Privy Council in London. Defendants with money don’t hesitate to take the case all the way. “That could take five, six, seven years between all the levels,” Zagaris said. On the other hand, Bankman-Fried could ultimate decide to return to the US, said Michael Zweiback, a Los Angeles-based criminal defense lawyer with extradition experience. He said many Americans choose to return rather than sit in a foreign jail. Though Bankman-Fried was living in a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas, there’s no guarantee he would be released on bail during the extradition process, Zweiback said. “He can waive extradition and of course he will be placed in handcuffs and put on board a plane with an escort from the US Marshals Service and brought to La Guardia or JFK Airport and brought straight to the SDNY courthouse.” Zweiback said, referring to the Manhattan federal court. “He can sign extradition paperwork tomorrow and be there within a week.”   ",2022-12-13

really interesting graph from the Australian Bureau pf Statistics which goes some way to explaining why wage growth has been in the slow lane for so long (aside from recently because of staff shortages).Just 12.3 per cent of workers belong to a trade union.  That's just 1.4 million people and is down from 41 per cent of employees three decades ago.  Lower union membership reduces the collective bargaining power of workers.More women than men are union members with the highest proportion of unionists in the education and training industry.The ABS also says that one in every thirty

Crypto and freedom advocates should ensure decentralization as a principle is enshrined, and cooperate to realize and expand on Nikola Tesla’s vision of a decentralized, ubiquitous network.In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse found themselves in an ideological battle over the future of electricity. Threatened by Tesla and Westinghouse’s widely adopted alternating currents (AC) power system, Edison built out his direct-current (DC) stations, while deploying ruthless public relations campaigns to undermine his rivals’ credibility. As the three men urgently took their products to market and built out supporting infrastructure, corporations on the periphery also competed for market share, including Brush Electricity Company – which installed its arc lighting solutions in key regions including New York City.Tim Kravchunovsky is the Founder and CEO of Chirp. A graduate of Columbia University’s Masters Program, he has over 20 years experience as a network engineer and previously consulted for the World Bank.The AC system won out and became the gold standard underlying all electrification. An important lesson remains for those developing new architecture: The best technology can triumph only when it is also widely adopted.After developing the AC system, Tesla devoted much of his life to revolutionizing wireless electricity. The inventor envisioned infinite energy via a global network of towers that would electrify the world without wires. While investors including J.P. Morgan initially backed Tesla’s venture based on his past success with AC electricity, they later cut funding – a system handing such power over to end users, independent of the large companies who clashed during the “War of the Currents,” was too radical for many to handle at the time, and the technology wasn’t in place yet.Story continuesTesla died penniless in New York City, but his vision of ubiquitous energy run across a decentralized wireless system has served as inspiration for scientists, entrepreneurs and world leaders. Founders need to think carefully about the incentive structures that go into building such a system, while resisting centralized parties looking to co-opt its mechanisms under their own infrastructures – the blockchain sector in particular is in a unique position to guard against these attempts.While there is heroism in Elon Musk – an heir to Tesla’s legacy – stepping in to provide Starlink to Ukrainian citizens, there are also warnings that founders should note. Following Starlink’s deployment, Musk walked back his initial support for the cause and threatened to withdraw the program unless the U.S. Defense Department footed the bill. Although Musk also walked back these comments and kept Starlink operational in the region, the reversal revealed an incentive structure based on geopolitics, profit margins, and a billionaire’s impulses – which millions of innocent people suddenly found themselves tethered to. Musk is hardly an outlier when it comes to the murky relationship between centralized vested interests and state power. Telecom companies provide troves of data on millions of users daily to government entities.As the original use case of blockchain technology, Bitcoin allows any individual – no matter their socioeconomic class or country of origin – to take custody of their money. When applied to IoT devices, broadband and telecommunications infrastructure, blockchain technology can bestow more universe digital rights, including the ability to access modern internet and phone services without being surveilled.In the current “builder’s market,” blockchain developers and founders need to pay closer attention to the developments unfolding across telecommunications, broadband and IoT, rather than speculative digital asset bubbles that, unfortunately, defined the space over the past few years. Whether it’s setting up routers to power decentralized wireless networks (following in the tradition of Satoshi Nakamoto sending himself test amounts of bitcoin), or writing interoperable code, the crypto community should apply the principles of decentralization to this next frontier, and work together to ensure the ubiquitous network as envisioned by Tesla can take hold on the same scale as the inventor’s AC gold standard.",2022-12-13

The business adds that its choice of brand name web-5 does not stop it from being used by others.   M.

We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightThe Justice Department accused Bankman-Fried, 30, of multiple crimes, including conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and violating campaign finance laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that he defrauded his investors, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed fraud accusations as well. The accusations show the reach and influence the young crypto baron amassed in just a few years.Up until recently one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at $32 billion by its investors, FTX collapsed into bankruptcy in November, enraging the scores of clients who had thought their cryptocurrency holdings were safely stored on the company’s exchanges. FTX had established a veneer of legitimacy, winning investments from respected venture capital firms, paying to have its logo on shirts of Major League Baseball umpires, spending lavishly on Super Bowl advertising and pouring money into political donations.AdvertisementBut U.S. officials allege Bankman-Fried was actually perpetrating a massive, global fraud, using customer money to pay off debts incurred by his hedge fund Alameda Research, invest in other companies and make donations. And now, it seems, much of the money is missing.Representatives from the Southern District of New York, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FBI spoke on Dec. 13. (Video: Reuters, Photo: Stephanie Keith/Getty Images/Reuters)“This is one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Tuesday during a news conference in New York. The alleged fraud destroyed “billions of dollars in customer value overnight,” he said.For the past several weeks, Bankman-Fried had been hunkered down in his luxury apartment in Nassau, Bahamas, posting on social media and giving repeated media interviews in which he said he made grave mistakes but didn’t knowingly commit any crimes. His arrest and the charges, coming within hours of each other, are a rapid acceleration in the ongoing story of FTX, which has gripped the cryptocurrency world since the once well-respected company crumbled over a period of several days in November when it could not meet customer withdrawal demands.AdvertisementOn Tuesday, a judge in the Bahamas denied bail to Bankman-Fried, meaning he will stay in jail as he fights extradition to the United States.Cryptocurrencies, which use complex math equations running on a decentralized network of computers to establish value without a central owner such as a bank or nation, soared in value and popularity during the pandemic as speculative assets. As prices for crypto tokens and coins marched upward, many people scored newfound fortunes. The total value of cryptocurrencies around the world hit $3 trillion in November 2021.But over the past year, amid rising interest rates, concerns about a potential recession and several high-profile crypto company collapses, prices for crypto assets have plummeted. Bitcoin and ethereum, the two most popular cryptocurrencies, are down about 65 percent since the beginning of the year.AdvertisementFTX’s demise is by far the biggest for the crypto industry this year, and Bankman-Fried’s downfall as one of its chief protagonists has deepened scrutiny of the industry as a whole.“Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement when charges were announced. “The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.”Bankman-Fried appeared Tuesday in court in the Bahamas, where his lawyer argued in a contentious hearing that took up much of the day that he should be granted bail as a nonviolent offender. But prosecutors in the country said he was a flight risk and could have money hidden in other countries. The judge did not grant him bail.AdvertisementIt’s unclear how long Bankman-Fried’s extradition process will take, or what his chances are of fighting a return to the United States.Mark Botnick, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried, said his client “is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.”Share this articleShareWhile Bankman-Fried was in court in Nassau, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing focusing on FTX, which the former CEO was slated to attend via video call before his arrest.The hearing did however feature FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, a veteran bankruptcy lawyer who took over the company to try to recover as many assets for customers and creditors as possible when FTX declared bankruptcy.The alleged crimes at the heart of the crypto company’s collapse are simple, despite the seemingly complex nature of the circumstances, Ray said during the hearing.Advertisement“This isn’t sophisticated whatsoever. This is just plain old embezzlement,” he said.The recovery process will take “months, not weeks,” he added, and FTX customers will not get all their money back. “At the end of the day, we’re not going to be able to recover all the losses here,” he said.The hearing exhibited a sense of anticlimax, as politicians who had prepared to grill Bankman-Fried himself were stuck instead asking questions of the agreeable Ray. “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the committee, said in a statement Monday night.Before his fall, Bankman-Fried had donated tens of millions of dollars to politicians, becoming the second-largest Democratic donor in the 2022 midterm elections and building a prominent position for himself in Washington.AdvertisementA number of crypto champions on the financial services panel used their time during the hearing to argue that FTX was a singularly bad actor that should not taint the rest of the sector. “We have to separate out the bad actions of an individual from the good created by an industry and an innovation,” Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), who is set to chair the committee next year, said in his opening statement.But there were signs that the company’s implosion is weighing on lawmakers’ views of the broader industry. “My patience with the crypto bulls is wearing thin,” Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) said toward the end of the four-hour session. “It’s been 14 years, and the American public has heard lots of promises but seen lots of Ponzi schemes. For crypto, it’s time to put up or shut up.”At the white-and-pink Magistrate’s Court in Nassau, Bahamas, Bankman-Fried appeared wearing a suit coat without a tie, according to the Nassau Guardian, a local newspaper. Members of Bankman-Fried’s family and representatives from the U.S. Embassy were present in the courtroom, according to the newspaper.AdvertisementBankman-Fried’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford University’s law school. The SEC alleges Bankman-Fried used funds that had been commingled with customer money to buy them real estate. A spokesperson for Bankman and Fried did not return a request for comment.The saga is far from over.The government’s indictment suggests that prosecutors will indict more people or may already be working with one or several of Bankman-Fried’s associates to build their case against him, said Mark Kasten, a lawyer with Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney who has worked on cryptocurrency litigation.“Conspiracy is not something you do alone,” Kasten said.correctionAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount Bankman-Fried gave to Democratic political candidates in the 2022 midterm elections. It was tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions. This version has been corrected.Tory Newmyer in Washington; Tim Craig in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Steven Zeitchik and Shayna Jacobs in New York; and Tony Williams in Nassau, Bahamas, contributed to this report.Share CommentsMore on cryptocurrencyHAND CURATEDBad news for thousands of crypto investors: They don’t own their accountsJanuary 5, 2023Bad news for thousands of crypto investors: They don’t own their accountsJanuary 5, 2023Caroline Ellison wanted to make a difference.

While such data only refers to Binance’s Ethereum and ERC-20 token movements, approximately 63% of Binance’s portfolio is on Ethereum and the outflows are much larger compared to other crypto exchanges over the same period.ADAD Binance Netflow 7D ($) -3,660,311,347 8,783,380,428 - Outflow5,123,069,081 - Inflow Exchange Flows dashboard ⤵️https://t.co/CYrBQLryQ0 pic.twitter.com/vV6vcqoWKK — Nansen 🧭 (@nansen_ai) December 13, 2022Binance’s $3.66 billion weekly outflow is leagues more than Coinbase, for example, which saw a net outflow of roughly $574 million from its main exchange and $248 million from its Coinbase Custody service. Binance US saw a net outflow of over $38.7 million in that same period.Web3 investment firm Jump Crypto is among the entities that removed funds from Binance, according to Nansen. On Ethereum, Jump withdrew about $18.4 million this week and pulled about $123.4 million from Binance last week.While Binance is currently seeing a high volume of withdrawals, the exchange still holds roughly $58.9 billion in assets at time of writing, most of which are in Binance’s stablecoin BUSD, the stablecoin Tether, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.According to Nansen’s portfolio tracker, Binance’s total portfolio has decreased by $3.6 billion in just the past eight hours. Binance’s exchange token, BNB, is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is down about 2% in the past 24 hours, and down 8% in the past two weeks, according to CoinGecko data. Those declines come despite Ethereum rising 12% in the past two weeks and Bitcoin seeing a 9% uptick in price. ADADIn response to the outflow news, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that it’s just “business as usual.” We saw some withdrawals today (net $1.14b ish).

The SEC alleges Bankman-Fried defrauded investors and illegally used their money to buy real estate on behalf of himself and his family.US authorities said they will try to claw back any of Bankman-Fried’s financial gains from the alleged scheme.A lawyer for Bankman-Fried, Mark S. Cohen, said Tuesday he is “reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.”At a congressional hearing Tuesday that was scheduled before Bankman-Fried’s arrest, the new CEO brought in to steer FTX through its bankruptcy proceedings levelled harsh criticism.He said there was scant oversight of customers’ money and “very few rules” about how their funds could be used.John Ray III told members of the House Financial Services Committee the collapse of FTX, resulting in the loss of more than US$7 billion (NZ$10.83b), was the culmination of months, or even years, of bad decisions and poor financial controls.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“This is not something that happened overnight or in a context of a week,” he said.He added: “This is just plain, old-fashioned embezzlement, taking money from others and using it for your own purposes.”Before his arrest, Bankman-Fried had been holed up in his luxury compound in the Bahamas.US authorities are expected to request his extradition to the United States, although the timing of that request is unclear.At a court hearing in the Bahamas on Tuesday, prosecutors argued Bankman-Fried was a flight risk and should be held without bail, according to Our News, a broadcast news company based there.His lawyers said he is likely to request a formal extradition hearing.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Bankman-Fried was previously one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper.At one point his net worth reached US$26.5b, according to Forbes. He was a prominent personality in Washington, donating millions of dollars toward mostly left-leaning political causes and Democratic political campaigns, though he also gave money to Republicans.FTX grew to become the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.That all unravelled quickly last month, when reports called into question the strength of FTX’s balance sheet.As customers sought to withdraw billions of dollars, FTX could not satisfy the requests: their money was gone.‘Personal piggy bank’AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.The SEC complaint alleges Bankman-Fried had raised more than US$1.8b from investors since May 2019 by promoting FTX as a safe, responsible platform for trading crypto assets.Instead, the complaint says, Bankman-Fried diverted customers’ funds to Alameda Research without telling them.“He then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses,” the complaint reads.“None of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers.”Alameda did not segregate FTX investor funds and Alameda investments, the SEC said, using that money to “indiscriminately fund its trading operations,” as well as other ventures of Bankman-Fried.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Bankman-Fried said recently he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and that he believes angry customers will eventually get their money back.At Tuesday’s congressional hearing, the new FTX CEO bluntly disputed that at the hearing: “We will never get all these assets back,” Ray said.In its complaint, the SEC challenged Bankman-Fried’s recent assertion that FTX and its customers were victims of a sudden market collapse that overwhelmed safeguards that had been in place.“FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s enforcement division. “That veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.”The collapse of FTX — which followed other cryptocurrency debacles earlier this year — is adding urgency to efforts to regulate the industry.Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in financial and securities regulation, said U.S. lawmakers and regulators have been too slow to act, but that is likely to change.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Lawmakers are clearly under pressure to do something, given that so many people have lost their money,” she said.-By KEN SWEET, AP Business Writer in New York.

We expect to see an increasing number of sustainability-focused systems launching in 2023, where things like water usage or plastic creation could similarly be tracked and reported. Governments and regulators could create clear standards for what levels of environmental impact are acceptable across various industries and utilize these blockchain systems to monitor them. This would not only benefit the planet itself, but it would also streamline business processes via clear expectations for emissions.Even electrical grids can be managed via blockchains and smart contracts. Where power is routed can be largely automated while also being tracked, and this development stands to make energy use far more equitable. Applications that improve energy demand management can become easier, providing incentives for grid users. Increased access to investment in renewable energy infrastructure is a real possibility enabled by blockchain.The aforementioned ECP is a prime example of the sentiment within Web3 to tackle this monumental challenge. Beyond efforts to mitigate Ethereum's previous carbon footprint, the ECP aims to create a positive impact via investment in scaling carbon-reducing technologies that leverage blockchain.Another important possibility of blockchain and its applications such as DeFi (decentralized finance) is its ability to provide tools to empower communities most affected by climate change and business generated consumption, such as those in the global south. In other applications such as supply chain, it can bring more transparency and provability to equitable distribution of revenue and improved treatment; the next generation of fair trade.Clearly, this technology is nascent, and nobody is saying that blockchain on its own is a panacea for dealing with climate change. Nonetheless, more industries must consider what this technology can offer. Perhaps the most important initial component is accountability for companies claiming to be engaging in sustainable practices. That said, there is so much more that is possible. The world should begin paying attention and get past the notion that blockchain is part of the problem because, in truth, it could form part of the solution.",2022-12-13

The report showed its holdings of Bitcoin exceeded customer deposits on a single day in November. The $1.9bn of withdrawals of tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain mark the largest daily outflow over a 24-hour period since June 13, the Nansen data showed, and accounted for the majority of the funds being pulled in the last seven days. “Binance’s withdrawals are increasing due to the growing uncertainty about its reserves report,” a Nansen spokesperson said.

I actually think it is a good idea to “stress test withdrawals” on each CEX on a rotating basis. 💪 1/2 https://t.co/uF9lLPDSyS — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 2022 A Binance spokesperson earlier said it always had “more than enough funds” to meet withdrawal requests. “User assets at Binance are all backed 1:1 and Binance’s capital structure is debt free,” the person said. Asked whether Binance had enough USDC to meet USDC withdrawal requests, the person added it may need to move funds to online “hot” digital wallets from offline wallets, convert stablecoins from one another or carry out network upgrades, sometimes causing delays. Binance said in a tweet about 16:54 GMT that USDC withdrawals had resumed. Cryptocurrency news outlet CoinDesk reported earlier that Binance saw outflows of $902m on Monday. Binance has already been under pressure from authorities. Splits between US Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a long-running criminal investigation focused on Binance’s compliance with US anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, Reuters reported on Monday. Halted withdrawals Earlier on Tuesday, Binance halted withdrawals of USDC, citing a “token swap” – where digital token holders exchange their crypto-coins, typically over different blockchains. “On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals,” Binance’s Zhao tweeted at around 08:20 GMT. Binance said in September it would automatically convert user balances and new deposits of USD Coin and two other stablecoins into its own stablecoin, Binance USD. Zhao said on Tuesday swapping USDC with two other tokens – Paxos Standard and Binance USD – requires using traditional dollars at a bank in New York. “The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open.” USDC, issued by US-based firm Circle, is the world’s second-biggest stablecoin, and is used by investors to trade in and out of different cryptocurrencies without having to convert them to US dollars. Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer and head of global policy, said that there will be “challenges” relating to liquidity and redemptions when assets are swapped in the way Binance has done with USDC. “The feature of liquid dollar digital currencies should be that they are redeemable on demand, and at par at all times, even during conditions of stress,” Disparte added.

According to Hayes, his main reasoning for investing in both was their platform revenue and their potential to outperform standard Treasury bills. Let’s take a brief look at on-chain data and compare GMX and LOOKS to competitors to determine whether Arthur’s assumption will work out. GMX usage cooling after a strong NovemberThe week prior to Nov. 16 provided decentralized finance (DeFi) with a significant influx in fees after the centralized exchange (CEX) exodus triggered by FTX’s bankruptcy. The temporary high inflows to DeFi propelled GMX to outperform Uniswap in protocol fees. On Nov. 28, GMX earned about $1.15 million in daily trading fees, which surpassed Uniswap’s $1.06 million in trading fees on the same day.GMX fees and daily active users.

The GMX token is only 8% away from an all-time high, after gaining 59% in the past 30-days.GMX token performance. Source: Delphi DigitalSince Uniswap is the closest competitor to GMX, comparing the two protocols can show which users prefer to use for trading. Aside from the fee flip on Nov. 28, Uniswap continues to outperform GMX in terms of fee revenue and daily active users. Unlike Uniswap, GMX distributes fees to stakers of various GMX and GLP tokens. The 90-day peak for Uniswap fees is $5.9 million, whereas GMX’s high in daily fees is only $1.4 million. The major difference in peak fees may show that GMX has reached capacity when it comes to platform usage. The fees that GMX accrues are split 30% to GMX token holders and 70% to GLP holders. The current homepage for GMX estimates an annual percentage yield of 10% for GMX tokens and 20% for GLP tokens. While GLP would fit Hayes’ 20% annual yield goal, liquidity providers are susceptible to impairment loss and price declines, making it difficult to ensure success against the conservative Treasury bill strategy.Fees earned by Uniswap and GMX. Source: TokenTerminalOpenSea usage continues to dominate LooksRareLooksRare, which is also the home of the LOOKS token, was also mentioned by Hayes due to the fees the NFT protocol earns. To date, NFT marketplaces, including Coinbase, have struggled to chip away at OpenSea’s market dominance. While OpenSea seems to have a natural flow of daily active users between 35,000 and 50,000, LooksRare has a small range of 350 to 500 users. Using this metric, OpenSea is 100 times bigger than LooksRare and the trend does not seem to change over a 90-day timeframe. Another difference between the two protocols is that OpenSea does not have a token that emits rewards through staking and inflationary minting. The rewards emission may hit Hayes’ 20% goal, but it should also be noted that LooksRare is notorious for wash trading. The primary objective of these wash trader is to gain more LOOKS tokens, but this could have the effect of diluting the price. Daily active users of LooksRare and OpenSea.

Source: TokenTerminalInvestigating the protocol fundamentals mentioned by Hayes are an important first step when considering investing in DeFi and altcoin. Looking at the competitive landscape for both LooksRare and GMX, it would take much more adoption for either protocol to overtake the current leaders. Furthermore, the 20% goal Hayes sets out might be a stretch when analyzing inflated emissions and token prices.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.

Bankman-Fried was arrested on Monday in the Bahamas on federal charges filed in the U.S., which include multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX. The rise and stunning fall of Bankman-Fried combines the get-rich-quick allure of cryptocurrencies with the breathless hype that formerly surrounded the 30-year-old MIT graduate, whom Fortune magazine once called possibly the  ""next Warren Buffett."" And in wake of FTX's bankruptcy, the entrepreneur has left investors reeling and FTX owing its creditors at least $3 billion.          ""Everybody loved the idea of a politically progressive entrepreneur ... who was going to change the world, all while making them gobs of money,"" said Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican from Michigan, in a congressional hearing on Tuesday about the FTX collapse.Here's what to know about the charges facing Bankman-Fried.    Why was Sam Bankman-Fried arrested? Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Monday based on federal charges that were unsealed Tuesday morning, which include eight counts of wire fraud, money laundering, violations of securities laws and other financial crimes. The charges, which were filed by the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, allege that he knowingly defrauded customers by using their cryptocurrency assets to pay for debts and expenses from Alameda Research, FTX's hedge fund. The charges allege that the fraud started as early as 2019, or the year that FTX was founded. Is Bankman-Fried facing other charges? Yes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — the agency that regulates the financial markets — also filed charges against Bankman-Fried on Tuesday.    In that case, the agency is accusing Bankman-Fried of commingling FTX customers' funds with Alameda to make undisclosed venture investments, expensive real estate purchases and big political donations.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Tuesday announced similar fraud charges against Bankman-Fried and FTX, alleging in a lawsuit that the company caused customers to lose $8 billion. How much money did FTX lose? John Ray III, who stepped in as FTX CEO after Bankman-Fried's resignation on Nov. 11 after a long career that included overseeing the Enron bankruptcy, said in a House hearing on Tuesday that about $7 billion was lost in the collapse. Ray alleged that Bankman-Fried and others at FTX misused customer funds, contributing to the losses.""It's really just the unlimited ability of those in control positions to borrow customer funds or take customer funds and then deploy them for their own use,"" Ray said in the hearing. ""That use involved margin trading, which is inherently risky.""He claimed, ""This is really old-fashioned embezzlement — it's not sophisticated at all.""Bankman-Fried had been expected to testify at the hearing, but he was removed from the witness list following his arrest.What did FTX tell customers it was doing?FTX's customers used the exchange to buy, store and trade hundreds of different cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, solana, litecoin and dogecoin. At one point, $840 million worth of crypto assets were exchanged on its platform each day, according to CoinMarketCap.    FTX gained national attention with its expensive Super Bowl ads this year featuring quarterback Tom Brady and comedian Larry David. In the Larry David ad, when the comedian is told that FTX is a ""safe and easy way to get into crypto,"" he responds, ""Eh, I don't think so — and I'm never wrong about this stuff.""FTX portrayed itself as being able to help people interested in crypto safely navigate the complexity of what is a notoriously risky asset class. But the company had very few internal controls to protect customer assets, with investor money transferred to Alameda and customer funds co-mingled into ""one pot of crypto,"" Ray testified on Tuesday. What led to FTX's collapse?Ray and regulators are examining the internal workings of FTX to get to the bottom of the failure, but the company unraveled in early November after finding itself billions of dollars in debt due to speculative investments, including in the company's own digital coin, that turned sour and a series of other miscalculations.Bankman-Fried has said he mistakenly believed FTX had enough cash on hand to pay 24 times the amount of money users typically withdraw in a day. In actuality, the firm had a much thinner capital cushion, with only enough cash to pay 0.8 times that amount.When customers sought to withdraw their money amid fears about the company's solvency, there was ""a run on the bank,"" Ray said on Tuesday.Ray highlighted other issues with FTX, such as its misuse of customer funds and what he alleged was Bankman-Fried's decision to make investments without properly valuing the assets. ""By definition I don't trust a single piece of paper in this organization,"" Ray said on Tuesday.    What happens now?The U.S. is expected to ask authorities in the Bahamas to extradite Bankman-Fried, which experts said is likely within the scope of a 1931 treaty between the two countries.Because of that existing legal framework, ""This would be a moment where one could strike while the iron is hot,"" Michael Parker, head of anti-money laundering and sanctions practice at law firm Ferrari & Associates, told CBS News. ""If Mr. Bankman-Fried, for instance, went to another jurisdiction, it could be more difficult, and so the Bahamas may have been seen as a friendlier jurisdiction from which jurisdiction could take place.""       Sam Bankman-Fried facing likely extradition to the U.S. after arrest in the Bahamas 05:06  In pursuing the case against Bankman-Fried, Parker said prosecutors will have to show that he knowingly committed the alleged crimes outlined in their indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.

SOL’s bulls have held their ground so far. However, another defense of this belt might be too much to ask from the exhausted bulls.  Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-2024  Bitcoin [BTC] also faced resistance at $17.3k. The king coin would continue to have a bearish bias until the $17.3k and $17.6k levels were beaten. This meant that altcoins could have a hard time rallying as well. Solana traded within a range last month, and a move beneath the mid-range mark would signal a drop toward $11.      Solana bulls were unable to pierce a bearish breaker at $15 despite repeated attempts Source: SOL/USDT on TradingView On 10 November, Solana consolidated near the $14.1-$15 area for a few hours. It dropped swiftly from the $37 mark when news of the FTX collapse broke out. These few hours of consolidation were followed by a rally to $18 and formed a bullish order block. But in recent weeks, this zone of support was flipped to a region of resistance. Since 14 November the same area, highlighted by the red box, has acted as a bearish breaker. It also represented the highs of the range that SOL traded within over the past month. This range extended from $15 to $11.3, and its mid-point lay at $13.14. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 12-hour chart was below neutral 50 and showed that bears occupied the driver’s seat. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was neutral and did not indicate either a strong buying or selling pressure since 3 December. If Solana closed the 12-hour or one-day trading session below $13.14, it was likely to head toward the range lows at $11.3. Open Interest was in steady decline, showing buyers were weak Source: Coinglass Since 24 November, the Open Interest chart has made a series of lower highs. Further, the OI gradually declined over the past three weeks. Solana reached a local top of $14.96 on that day, but has since been unable to ascend any further. The falling OI and the gradual decline in prices meant that buyers who were optimistic about a breakout were forced to close their positions.

Here is the latest on the collapse of FTX and what comes next for Bankman-Fried: WHO IS SAM BANKMAN-FRIED? Bankman-Fried was raised in California by two Stanford University law professors, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried. Bankman-Fried, 30, started his career at Jane Street Capital after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a choice he has said was influenced by a desire to make money to pursue his interest in effective altruism, a movement that encourages people to prioritize donations to charities. He amassed a fortune taking advantage of the price differences in bitcoin in Asia and the United States after departing Jane Street in 2017. He eventually started crypto trading firm Alameda Research in 2017 and founded FTX a year later. It was valued in January at US$32 billion. Forbes estimated a year ago that Bankman-Fried’s fortune was as high as US$26.5 billion. Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO of Alameda in October 2021 and ceded the role to Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco, who acted as co-CEOs until Trabucco departed the firm in August. In a Twitter Spaces event held on Dec 1, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that he and Ellison had ""been together for a while"", although he declined to give any more details. Ellison did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Known in financial circles by his initials, SBF, Bankman-Fried was an unconventional figure known for his wild hair, t-shirts and shorts. He contributed US$5.2 million to President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign and became one of the largest donors to Democratic political candidates. WHY DID FTX COLLAPSE? FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov 11 after it struggled to raise money to stave off collapse as traders rushed to withdraw US$6 billion from the platform in just 72 hours and rival exchange Binance abandoned a proposed rescue deal. Bankman-Fried has said that Alameda had built up a substantial position on FTX and that as digital asset prices plummeted this year, Alameda became increasingly more levered. ""Realistically speaking, (there was) no ability for FTX to be able to liquidate that position and generate everything that was owed,"" he said at the New York Times' DealBook Summit in a Nov 30 interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin. The liquidity crunch at FTX came after Bankman-Fried secretly moved US$10 billion of FTX customer funds to Alameda Research, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Bankman-Fried told Reuters in November the company did not ""secretly transfer"" but rather misread its ""confusing internal labelling"". He also told Sorkin that he ""wasn't trying to comingle funds"", but said that when FTX did not have a bank account, some customers wired money to Alameda and were credited on FTX, which likely led to discrepancies. WHY WAS HE ARRESTED? Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas at the behest of US prosecutors shortly after 6pm on Monday. The Bahamas attorney general's office said it expects he will be extradited to the United States. US prosecutors said Bankman-Fried had engaged in a scheme to defraud FTX's customers by misappropriating their deposits to pay for Alameda's expenses and debts and to make investments. He also defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing them with false and misleading information about the hedge fund's condition, and sought to disguise the money he had earned from committing wire fraud, prosecutors said. Separately, Bankman-Fried was sued by regulators on Tuesday. The US Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Bankman-Fried defrauded investors in FTX by raising more than US$1.8 billion in equity while concealing that the company was diverting customer funds to Alameda. Also on Tuesday, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused Bankman-Fried and his companies of fraud and making fraudulent misstatements of material fact. Bankman-Fried said he was pressured into filing for bankruptcy and into nominating John Ray as chief executive of FTX in November by Sullivan and Cromwell lawyers who were advising his firm at the time, according to a draft of his testimony to Congress seen by Reuters that he had prepared to give on Tuesday. FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIM NOW? Bankman-Fried is expected to be extradited to the United States where he will be formally arraigned and a judge will determine if he will be held in jail or released until his trial. Bankman-Fried said on Tuesday, however, that he would not waive his right to an extradition hearing. Prosecutors and regulators would typically agree that the criminal charges, which have a higher burden of proof, would be pursued while the civil cases are stayed, according to legal experts. Bankman-Fried could try to work out a deal that encompasses both the criminal and civil cases. Prosecutors will seek restitution for proceeds derived from Bankman-Fried's alleged crimes, but it may be difficult to locate assets, according to legal experts.                    ",2022-12-13

Bankman-Fried said he was pressured into filing for bankruptcy and into nominating John Ray as chief executive of FTX in November by Sullivan and Cromwell lawyers who were advising his firm at the time, according to a draft of his testimony to Congress seen by Reuters that he had prepared to give on Tuesday. FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIM NOW? Bankman-Fried is expected to be extradited to the United States where he will be formally arraigned and a judge will determine if he will be held in jail or released until his trial. Bankman-Fried said on Tuesday, however, that he would not waive his right to an extradition hearing. Prosecutors and regulators would typically agree that the criminal charges, which have a higher burden of proof, would be pursued while the civil cases are stayed, according to legal experts. Bankman-Fried could try to work out a deal that encompasses both the criminal and civil cases. Prosecutors will seek restitution for proceeds derived from Bankman-Fried's alleged crimes, but it may be difficult to locate assets, according to legal experts.                    ",2022-12-13

On Tuesday, following that arrest, those charges were made public and are expected to be followed by a request to extradite SBF from the Bahamas to the US. Prosecutors for the Southern District of New York filed an eight-count criminal indictment [PDF] for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud; committing securities fraud wire fraud, and money laundering; and conspiracy to violate campaign finance rules.        The Feds contend that from about November 2019 up through the collapse of FTX and affiliated companies in November 2022, SBF participated in a scheme to defraud investors by using FTX customer funds to pay for expenses and debts incurred by his private hedge fund Alameda Research.                 In other words, it is claimed, FTX secretly funneled billions in people's private funds into Alameda, which then gambled – sorry – invested the money into a wide range of startups and projects as well as covering the org's expenses. When concerns over Alameda and FTX surfaced last month or so, and people tried to pull their money out of the exchange, it was unable to comply due to what appeared to be a liquidity crunch, and imploded, ultimately filing for bankruptcy. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has also brought a civil complaint [PDF] against SBF alleging a scheme to defraud investors. ""We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,"" said SEC chairman Gary Gensler in a statement.        ""The alleged fraud committed by Mr Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws."" The SEC filing claims that while SBF told investors that ""FTX had top-notch, sophisticated automated risk measures in place to protect customer assets"" and that Alameda has no special privileges on the FTX platform, that was acually false. ""In truth, Bankman-Fried had exempted Alameda from the risk mitigation measures and had provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited 'line of credit' funded by the platform’s customers,"" the SEC complaint says.        Finally, America's Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil complaint [PDF] against SBF, FTX, and Alameda in the Southern District of New York alleging fraud and material misrepresentations in the sale of digital commodities that led to the loss of $8 billion in FTX customer deposits. FTX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, was valued at $32 billion at one point. ""As defendants touted and marketed FTX.com as a model digital commodity asset platform, defendants were committing fraud to the detriment of US investors and to the credibility of the digital asset markets,"" said CFTC Acting Director of Enforcement Gretchen Lowe, in a statement. ""We will work tirelessly to use the full scope of our enforcement authority to hold such fraudsters accountable.""  FTX Japan would let customers withdraw funds … if only anyone could log in FTX's crypto villain Sam Bankman-Fried admits 'I made a lot of mistakes' Too soon? Amazon commissions FTX mini-series FTX disarray declared 'unprecedented' by exec who cleaned up after Enron  The CFTC complaint suggests a broader set of people beyond SBF could be charged. It states, ""Bankman-Fried, his parents, and other FTX and Alameda employees used FTX customer funds for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury real estate purchases, private jets, documented and undocumented personal loans, and personal political donations."" Mark Cohen, a partner at New York law firm Cohen & Gresser which is representing SBF, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Bloomberg, at least $73 million in political donations could be clawed back if the government's litigation is successful, including more than $6 million given to a super political action committee for House Democrats, $3.5 million given to a GOP Senate leader fund, and $3 million given to a fund supporting Senate Democrats. Some political leaders have tried to get out ahead of the scandal. Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully to be the Governor of Texas, reportedly returned an unsolicited $1 million donation from SBF on November 4, 2022, just before Election Day. SBF had been scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday but he will not appear. His arrest precludes the possibility that he might make false statements under oath, which would broaden his legal jeopardy. Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, issued a statement expressing surprise at SBF's arrest and disappointment that he will not provide the public with answers. ""Although Mr Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that've harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,"" said Waters. ""The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.""  Open up, it's the IRS. We're here about the crypto tax you dodged READ MORE Speaking at the hearing via video, ​​US Democratic Representative from Illinois Jesús ""Chuy"" García (IL-04) said, ""FTX isn't an anomaly. Its collapse isn't just a case of one corrupt guy stealing money. It's about an entire industry that refuses to comply with existing regulation, that thinks it's above the law."" In prepared but not delivered remarks, obtained by Forbes, SBF challenges claims that have been made about what happened with FTX and the financial status of specific subsidiaries, while at the same time stating that he can't help more because he no longer has access to company information. He opens, ""I fucked up,"" and proceeds to share the blame with law firms and executives overseeing the bankruptcy process. On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is planning to hold a hearing titled ""Crypto Crash: Why the FTX Bubble Burst and the Harm to Consumers."" Among the scheduled speakers, Professor Hilary Allen, American University Washington College of Law, in prepared testimony [PDF] urges regulators to keep cryptocurrency outside the banking system as a matter of safety and argues the CFTC should not be the primary regulatory for crypto due to its lack of any investor protection mandate and its self-certification regime. ""A ban on crypto would be the most straight-forward way of protecting both investors and the financial system: it would end the uncontrolled creation of cryptoassets and also ensure that cryptoassets never require a bail-out,"" Allen's transcript says. ""If policymakers don’t wish to proceed with a ban, then they will need to be careful to ensure that any laws they do adopt don’t inadvertently encourage the proliferation of cryptoassets or bring those cryptoassets closer to the core of our financial system."" ®  Get our Tech Resources     ",2022-12-13

The seasoned group spent months of research time finding the most accurate way to portray their development over time. The Dypius suffix represents the galaxy’s nebulae. Gas, dust, and other materials “clump” together to form denser regions in space and these regions are called nebulas. They gather more material until they are dense enough to coalesce into stars, planets, and other objects in the solar system. Dypius is where everything from stars to planets to life itself was born. You’ve arrived at Dypius, a place where the future is made. At the advent of decentralized finance, DYP launched as a DeFi protocol, providing avenues for profit on three blockchains. It was obvious, however, that it would grow into something more. To be more specific, the group’s goal was to create a DeFi ecosystem that included a wide variety of products and services. Soon after, DYP grew to include twelve distinct products that serve the cryptocurrency industry’s and its consumers’ needs. Among these options is DYP Tools, a suite of advanced analytic tools that provides users with timely access to market data, insights, breaking news, and trend information to aid in the formation of more educated business decisions. The DYP Tools remain one of the most valuable components of the Dypius ecosystem despite the name change. The Dypius Launchpad is another initiative that helps new projects by exposing them to the global Dypius community and facilitating their access to funding in a decentralized setting. They are also working on the Dypius Metaverse, a one-of-a-kind metaverse platform that will eventually house the CAWS NFT archive. This fun and easy-to-use platform provide many features, including interactive environments, real-time communication with other users, and personalized content.

In addition, players have access to special avenues for gaining experience and other forms of value within the game. This platform provides users and companies with boundless opportunities through steady development and new features. The creator of DYP, Mihai Busica, offered some thoughts on the protocol’s name change to Dypius. “From the beginning, I have always envisioned a project that users can benefit from in an accessible and secure environment. I am extremely proud of our expert team’s dedication and the project’s journey from a simple protocol to an advanced decentralized ecosystem.

I believe you understand now why crypto winter is a much more accurate term than just a bear market!  However, there is one important difference between these two notions. Although ups and downs are pretty normal in the stock market or the silver market, we can’t exclude the possibility of crypto winter lasting forever. In other words, although well-established markets, like the gold market, have proved to have a pattern of ebbs and flows, and therefore we can reasonably expect that there will be a boom after a bust, cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, and it’s possible that their price will eventually fall to zero.

It was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges whose valuation plunged from $32 billion to bankruptcy within several days in November. To make matters worse, just hours after filing for bankruptcy, FTX experienced an alleged hack in which hundreds of millions of tokens were stolen. But what exactly happened? Well, there was a report published by CoinDesk which pointed out some potential leverage and solvency concerns. These worries, which were intensified by the sell-off of FTX’s tokens by another big player Binance, led to a classic bank run, i.e., customers demanded withdrawals. But FTX couldn’t satisfy these demands and faced a liquidity crisis.Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out. FTX’s collapse was the largest collapse in the history of cryptocurrencies that shook the whole crypto market and triggered other bankruptcies. It shows us how the so-called “easy money” fueled many crypto bubbles, which are popping right now amid the Fed’s tightening cycle. The bankruptcy of the crypto exchange also reminds us of the danger of fractional reserve banking and similar schemes. The company collapsed because of the gap between what it owed and what it could pay out. It worked like this: FTX used the money deposited by its clients to make speculative investments through a sister company, a crypto-trading firm Alameda Research. As clients started to withdraw their money, they discovered – what a surprise! – that FTX didn’t have enough of it to meet their demands. Implications for Silver What does crypto winter imply for silver prices? Well, the problems of the cryptocurrency market could prompt some investors to shift their funds from cryptos into more stable precious metals. Silver could especially benefit, as it’s believed to be a riskier bet than gold (it’s even sometimes called “gold on steroids”). Hence, crypto investors, who typically have high risk tolerance, could flow more naturally into the silver market. Another important implication is that it should be obvious now that cryptocurrencies are not substitutes for precious metals as safe havens. Although silver didn’t have the best year, as the chart below shows, it lost only 7% in the same period in which Bitcoin lost about three-quarters of its value. It shows that cryptos are still the Wild West, especially compared to the precious metals which enjoy centuries-long history and much smaller volatility. And if you buy physical bullion, you are not even susceptible to bank or quasi-bank runs!  To be clear, the precious metals market is not an easy market. But a recent Bank of International Settlements study shows that between 2015 and 2022, 73% to 81% of investors lost money on their investments in cryptocurrencies. I haven’t seen a comparable analysis for silver, but if you are retail investors, it’s probably much smarter (and safer) to invest in the silver market, especially if you have a long-term perspective.

Manhattan US A… [+2723 chars]",New York Post,"Accused crypto-fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried’s alleged accomplices were put on notice Tuesday that they face imminent arrest — and were urged to start cooperating before it’s too late. Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams said his “all-hands-on-deck investigation” into the $8 billion-plus collapse of Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange and Alameda Research hedge fund “is very much ongoing and it is moving very quickly.” “But I also want to be clear about something else: While this is our first public announcement, it will not be our last,” he said during an afternoon news conference in Lower Manhattan to formally unveil the charges against Bankman-Fried. Williams noted that Bankman-Fried’s eight-count indictment referenced unidentified co-conspirators and also said that various unidentified people were cooperating with the federal probe into “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.”   4  Sam Bankman-Fried faces multiple charges associated with fraud.TNS “To anyone who participated in wrongdoing at FTX or Alameda Research and who has not yet come forward, I would strongly encourage you to come see us before we come to you,” he said. Williams said Bankman-Fried’s alleged scam encompassed “four areas of misconduct” that involved defrauding FTX customers and investors, Alameda’s lenders, as well as violating campaign finance laws by making tens of millions of dollars in political donations to “both Democrats and Republicans.” “These contributions were disguised to look like they were coming from wealthy co-conspirators when, in fact, the contributions were funded by Alameda Research with stolen customer money,” he said.   4  US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams announces charges against Sam Bankman-Fried.Alec Tabak   4  Williams warned that anyone previously involved with FTX should come forward sooner rather than later.Alec Tabak “And all this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried’s desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington.” During a Q&A with reporters, Williams was asked about how Bahamas-loving, shaggy haired Bankman-Fried, 30,  didn’t fit the profile of a typical white-collar criminal.“Well, you can commit fraud in shorts and T-shirts in the sun. That’s possible, too,” Williams said.Williams also acknowledged that it was “very, very fast” for the feds to charge Bankman-Fried just weeks after FTX and Alameda went bust.“But I’ve also underscored that we’re not done,” he added.The FBI’s New York assistant director in charge, MIchael Driscoll, said authorities were “determined to help the victims of this case get a sense of justice, and we will continue to make every attempt to recover as much of their funds as possible.”“Fraud is fraud. It does not matter the complexity of the investment scheme. It does not matter the amount of money involved,” he said. “If you mislead and deceive to take what does not belong to you, we will hold you accountable.” Gurbir Grewal, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s director of enforcement, said Bankman-Fried “raised more than $1.8 billion from equity investors on the basis of lies” while operating “behind a veneer of legitimacy.”   4  The investigation into FTX is ongoing and moving fast.Getty Images/Stephanie Keith But Grewal said the “entire house of cards started to crumble as crypto prices plummeted in May of 2022.”  “That collapse has had far-reaching consequences for FTX customers, for its investors and for its counterparties,” he said. “But one immediate takeaway from today’s announcement should be that non-compliant trading platforms pose dramatic risks to both their investors and to their customers. “Among other things, they don’t provide them with the same robust level of disclosures and protections against fraud and conflicts of interest. That’s what traditional, US-registered securities exchanges provide. So it’s imperative that non-compliant platforms come into compliance,” he added.  ",2022-12-13

The pseudonymous crypto trader known as Capo tells his 685,200 Twitter followers that while Bitcoin (BTC) is rallying on the CPI data, the king crypto is meeting significant resistance around $17,800.         Despite beating expectations, Capo says the CPI numbers are still relatively high, and that Bitcoin likely won’t be able to break the $18,000 price level. November’s CPI came in at a 7.1% increase in prices over last year and a 0.1% increase over the prior month, versus an expected 7.3% increase over the year and a 0.3% from the prior month. “CPI better than expected, but still very high. Price is testing a massive resistance zone here and forming a lower high. I’m still 100% out of the market.”  Capo says Bitcoin is likely to drop down to $12,000 heading into 2023. At time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $17,729. Source: CryptoCapo/Twitter Capo also sets lower price targets for Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins. “Trend is still bearish. Indicators are pointing to full capitulation event. Bad news should come soon. ETH $600-$650. Altcoins 50%-70% potential drop (s**tcoins even more). Stay safe, things could get very ugly.” At time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,315. Capo also weighs in on Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of Binance, the world’s largest digital asset exchange, which has declined in value in recent days. Capo says BNB could drop by more than 85%, setting a price target range between $40-$45. At time of writing, BNB is changing hands at $273, down more than 6% from its weekly high of $291.

He tweaked the code to exempt Alameda Research, a hedge fund owned by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, from a feature on the trading platform that would have automatically sold off Alameda's assets if it was losing too much borrowed money. In a note explaining the change, the engineer, Nishad Singh, emphasized that FTX should never sell Alameda's positions. ""Be extra careful not to liquidate,” Singh wrote in the comment in the platform's code, which it showed he helped author. Reuters reviewed the code base, which has not been previously reported. The exemption allowed Alameda to keep borrowing funds from FTX irrespective of the value of the collateral securing those loans. That tweak in the code got the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged Bankman-Fried with fraud on Tuesday. The SEC said the tweak meant Alameda had a “virtually unlimited line of credit.” Furthermore, the billions of dollars that FTX secretly lent to Alameda over the next two years didn't come from its own reserves, but rather were other FTX customers' deposits, the SEC said. The SEC and a spokesperson for Bankman-Fried declined to comment for this story. Singh did not respond to several requests for comment. The regulator, which called the exchange “a house of cards,” alleged Bankman-Fried concealed that FTX diverted customer funds to Alameda in order to make undisclosed venture investments, luxury real estate purchases, and political donations. US prosecutors and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed separate criminal and civil charges, respectively. The complaints - along with previously unreported FTX documents seen by Reuters and three people familiar with the crypto exchange - provide new insights into how Bankman-Fried dipped into customer funds and spent billions more than FTX was making without the knowledge of investors, its customers and most employees. Police in the Bahamas, where FTX was based, arrested Bankman-Fried on Monday evening, capping a stunning fall from grace for the 30-year-old former billionaire. His company collapsed in November after users rushed to withdraw deposits and investors shunned his requests for more financing. FTX declared bankruptcy on Nov 11 and Bankman-Fried resigned as chief executive. Bankman-Fried has apologised to customers, but said he didn't personally think he had any criminal liability. The auto-liquidation exemption written into FTX code allowed Alameda to continually increase its line of credit until it “grew to tens of billions of dollars and effectively became limitless,” the SEC complaint said. It was one of two ways that Bankman-Fried diverted customer funds to Alameda. The other was a mechanism whereby FTX customers deposited over US$8 billion in traditional currency into bank accounts secretly controlled by Alameda. These deposits were reflected in an internal account on FTX that was not tied to Alameda, which concealed its liability, the complaint said. “SAFE, TESTED AND CONSERVATIVE” As Bankman-Fried grew FTX into one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, consumer protection was a central tenet of his pitch for crypto regulation in the United States. Bankman-Fried stressed this theme in countless statements to customers, investors, regulators and lawmakers. FTX’s auto-liquidation software would protect everyone, he explained. In congressional testimony on May 12, he called FTX’s software ""safe, tested and conservative"". “By quickly unwinding the riskiest, most undercollateralized positions, the risk engine prevents build-up of credit risk that could otherwise cascade beyond the platform, resulting in contagion,” Bankman-Fried testified. He did not tell lawmakers about the software change to exempt Alameda. Indeed, he told investors that Alameda received no preferential treatment from FTX, the SEC complaint said. Bankman-Fried had directed subordinates to update the software in mid-2020 to enable Alameda to maintain a negative balance on its account, the SEC complaint said. No other customer account at Alameda was allowed to do so, the complaint added. This would allow Alameda to keep borrowing more FTX funds without the need to provide more collateral. In software tweaks made in August 2020, Alameda was designated as the “Primary Market Maker” or “PMM,” according to a Reuters review of its codebase. Market makers are dealers who enable trading in an asset by standing ready to buy and sell it. To explain the change, Singh, the chief engineer, inserted a comment into the code: ""Alameda would be liquidating, prevented"". He included a warning ""not to liquidate the PMM"". Only Singh, Bankman-Fried and a few other top FTX and Alameda executives knew about the exemption in the code, according to three former executives briefed on the matter. A digital dashboard used by staff to track FTX customer assets and liabilities was programmed so it would not take into account that Alameda had withdrawn the client funds, according to two of the people and a screenshot of the portal that Reuters has previously reported. Bankman-Fried's house of cards ""began to crumble"" in May 2022, the SEC complaint said. As the value of crypto tokens plummeted that month, several of Alameda's lenders demanded repayment. Since Alameda didn't have the funds to meet these requests, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda to tap its ""line of credit"" with FTX to obtain billions of dollars in financing, the complaint said. Ultimately, when FTX customers dashed to withdraw their money this November, spooked by media reports about the company's financial health, many discovered that their funds were no longer there.

Attorneys representing the Bahamian government told a federal bankruptcy judge in Delaware that Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame, who was his co-CEO at the time, amassed a massive real estate portfolio throughout New Providence island in the Bahamas. The Bahamas representatives told the judge that it would be illegal under Bahamian law to allow US bankruptcy proceedings to administer the properties, according to CNBC. The Bahamian government wants the judge to dismiss bankruptcy proceedings against an FTX subsidiary that is listed as the owner of the properties. “Bahamian law does not allow recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding for a Bahamian company,” the attorneys for the island nation told the judge. But Bankman-Fried’s successor as CEO, John Ray, who was installed in the role to oversee the company’s bankruptcy restructuring, will likely resist any efforts by the Bahamian government to gain control over the assets.   4  Bankman-Fried’s company bought an estimated $256 million worth of real estate in the Bahamas, according to reports.Albany Bahamas Ray told the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that he is seeking to recover more than $7 billion in funds that could be returned to FTX investors — though the process is likely to take weeks, if not months. “At the end of the day, we are not going to be able to recover all the losses here,” Ray said on Tuesday.  “There was money spent that we will never get back.” Bankman-Fried was arrested by Bahamian authorities on Monday evening at the request of the US government. He is being held at a jail in the Bahamian capital of Nassau.   4  One of the properties was listed under the names of Bankman-Fried’s parents, Stanford law professors Sam Bankman and Barbara Fried.MEGA On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed the indictment against Bankman-Fried, who faces charges of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering.  They allege that Bankman-Fried devised “a scheme and artifice to defraud” FTX’s customers and investors beginning in 2019.  He diverted their money to cover expenses, debts and risky trades at his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations, prosecutors said in a 13-page indictment. If convicted, he faces a maximum of more than 100 years in federal prison.   4  The Bahamian government said US bankruptcy courts lack jurisdiction to rule on Bahamian real estate properties.Seaside Real Estate/ Bahamas MLS Bankman-Fried has said he will fight extradition to the US, though that would just delay the process by a few weeks, according to legal experts.

The FTX founder and former CEO was hit with eight counts, including wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., and money laundering. Bankman-Fried has also been accused of violating campaign finance laws by making illegal contributions under aliases, and the Justice Department has demanded he forfeit his assets. Damian Williams, U.S. attorney from SDNY, reiterated the charges later on Tuesday in a press conference. Williams said that Bankman-Fried had “knowingly” defrauded customers and investors of FTX as well as lenders to Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he founded in 2017. Williams accused Bankman-Fried of secretly and illegally funneling customer funds from FTX to finance operations at Alameda. “This is one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,” Williams said. He added that while only Bankman-Fried has been charged so far, “we are not done.” Williams was joined by a host of U.S. officials in outlining the charges against Bankman-Fried, including Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC Enforcement Division. The SEC brought a separate set of civil charges against Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, and Grewal warned other unregulated and rogue cryptocurrency trading platforms to register with the SEC soon, or risk falling afoul of federal prosecutors. “One immediate takeaway from today’s announcement should be that noncompliant trading platforms pose dramatic risks to both their investors and to their customers,” he said. “It’s imperative that noncompliant platforms come into compliance.” Federal regulators have been warning about the rise of noncompliant crypto platforms for months. In May, the SEC announced that Grewal’s division had brought forth more than 80 enforcement actions against “fraudulent and unregistered crypto asset offerings and platforms” since its creation in 2017. And FTX was far from the only crypto platform to implode and harm investors this year. Failures at crypto lender Voyager Digital and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital were just some of the many meltdowns the sector witnessed. Grewal warned noncompliant firms that time was running short for them to register with the SEC, echoing statements made last week by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who in an interview with Yahoo Finance warned crypto companies that the “runway is getting shorter” and they must “come into compliance” with U.S. regulations soon or risk facing legal action. On Tuesday, Grewal echoed Gensler’s earlier language.  “As Chair Gensler has made clear, the runway is getting shorter for them to come in to register with us. And for those who do not, the Enforcement Division stands ready to take action,” he said. Grewal warned investors and customers to remain cautious on crypto platforms, which he said “don’t provide [customers] with the same robust level of disclosures and protections against fraud and conflicts of interest” as SEC-registered platforms do.” As for Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO was expected to make a virtual appearance at a House hearing on Tuesday to answer regulators’ questions on the FTX collapse and lost customer funds, but was arrested Monday evening by authorities in the Bahamas, where he resided, on the direction of the U.S. government.  U.S. authorities are likely to request his extradition soon, Bahamian officials said Monday. Williams said extradition talks were “ongoing” with the Bahamas.Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter examines how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today's executives.

Bankman-Fried, 30, was one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors and even met with Biden’s White House advisers before his FTX currency exchange collapsed in one of the largest alleged frauds in American business history. Earlier Tuesday, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York charged Bankman-Fried with eight counts, including conspiracy to commit campaign finance violations. Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams claimed the illegal donations from Bankman-Fried amounted to “tens of millions of dollars.” “The president received campaign donations [from Bankman-Fried]. Will the president return that donation? Does he call on all politicians … to return those funds?” asked Associated Press reporter Zeke Miller. “So look, I’m covered here by the Hatch Act — [I’m] limited on what I can say and anything that’s connected to political contributions from here, I would have to refer you to the DNC,” Jean-Pierre said, citing the federal law that prohibits certain officials from advocating for candidates.   4  The White House did not say if President Biden would be returning campaign donations from disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty Images “I’m asking the president’s opinion, though,” Miller pressed. “You asked me two questions: You asked me about will he return donations and then you asked me about his opinion. I’m answering the first part, which is I’m covered by the Hatch Act from here. I’m limited on what I can say. And I just can’t talk to political contributions or anything related to that — I cannot speak to that from here,” Jean-Pierre claimed. When asked for her answer to the other question, regarding Biden’s opinion more generally, Jean-Pierre said, “I just cannot speak to this from here, even his thoughts.”   4  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she couldn’t answer the question about Bankman-Fried because of the Hatch Act.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images “Even his opinion, even his thoughts about the contributions, donations, I cannot speak about that from here,” she added. Violations of the Hatch Act typically involve direct support by federal officials to a candidate or party — as opposed to making a statement that could apply to candidates of both parties, such as calling on politicians to offload historical contributions. Bankman-Fried was welcomed this year to at least two West Wing meetings by one of Biden’s top aides, Steve Ricchetti, according to visitor logs. It’s unclear whom else he may have met during the April 22 and May 11 visits.   4  Bankman-Fried spent $10 million to help get Biden elected in 2020.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images Bankman-Fried gave $50,000 in October 2020 to the Biden Victory Fund and another $2,800 directly to the Biden campaign that same month, according to Federal Election Commission records. Since the collapse of FTX, the White House has referred questions about what Biden wants to do with his contributions to the Democratic National Committee, which has not responded to The Post’s inquiries.  In the 2020 election, Bankman-Fried spent $10 million backing Biden’s campaign — much of that indirectly.    4  Bankman-Fried was charged by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York with eight counts, including conspiracy to commit campaign finance violations.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images Bankman-Fried was the second-largest donor to congressional Democrats ahead of last month’s midterm election, donating at least $39.2 million — second only to left-wing billionaire George Soros. Although some Republicans received donations from Bankman-Fried, the money disproportionately went to Democrats.  Many members of Congress have already said they will redirect donations from Bankman-Fried and his younger brother, Gabriel, to charity — including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Reps. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.), Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.) and Kevin Hern (R-Okla.).  ",2022-12-13

Please refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure at the end of this release for an explanation of Zedge's formulation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.2We use the following business metrics in this release because we believe they are useful in evaluating Zedge as an investment.Monthly active users, or MAU, captures the number of unique users that used our Zedge App during the previous 30-days of the relevant period, is useful for evaluating consumer engagement with our App which correlates to advertising revenue as more users drive more ad impressions for sale. It also allows readers and potential advertisers to evaluate the size of our user base.Zedge Premium Gross Transaction Value, or GTV, is the total dollar amount of transactions conducted through the Zedge Premium Marketplace. As Zedge Premium is an internal focus for growth, we believe that this metric will help investors evaluate the progress we are making in growing this part of our business.Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User for our Zedge App, or ARPMAU, is a useful statistic in evaluating how well we are monetizing our user base.An Active Subscription is a subscription that has commenced and not been canceled, including paused subscriptions, and subscriptions in free trials, grace periods, or account hold.Total Installs - Cumulative is a measure of the cumulative number of times our Zedge App has been downloaded since inception.Fiscal 2023 Commentary""Although only halfway through the second quarter, we're encouraged to see both a continued ad spend rebound and improvement in Zedge Premium's GTV.""Additionally, earlier this month, we introduced ‘pAInt,' an A.I. wallpaper generator in the Zedge App. Although in its early days, our users have already created more than 150,000 images simply by describing what they want in a few words and letting the A.I. engine do the work. We believe this feature has the potential to convert consumers into aspiring creators easily, without the need for them to master the use of complicated graphic arts software to create great, unique content. We believe this feature has the potential to drive user growth and revenue.""GuruShots also started testing ‘Learn,' a feed of short-form instructional videos focused on improving photographic techniques. When surveying our users, nearly 70% said they would engage with this content regularly. ‘Learn' is also our first attempt to introduce a subscription offering to GuruShots' users. Additionally, we commenced early testing of ‘Battles,' which offers new users the opportunity to compete in simplified photo challenges that are short, limited in size and built on a coin-based economy. Our goal is to start scaling ‘Battles' over the next few quarters.""Finally, when we announced the GuruShots acquisition, we identified multiple opportunities for synergies between the two companies. Yesterday, we announced that we recently began marketing and recruiting initiatives to convert GuruShots players into new Zedge Premium artists. In addition to adding new content to the marketplace, we expect this to expand our portfolio of Zedge Premium artists by offering GuruShots players the opportunity to generate revenue from their photos.""As we look to the full year, given the overall macro challenges for the global consumer, we remain cautious in our outlook and reiterate our comments from our last earnings call for revenue growth and profits for fiscal 2023. Remember that we still expect to achieve these goals even as we invest in ramping up GuruShots, pAInt and other features to drive longer-term growth and profits,"" Reich concluded.Earnings Announcement and Supplemental InformationZedge's earnings release will be filed on Form 8-K and posted on the Zedge investor relations website (investor.zedge.net) at approximately 4:10 p.m. Eastern on December 13, 2022.

Among the investors moving XRP are whales, as reported by WhaleAlert. The tracker tweeted on December 13 that 300,000,000 XRP worth $115 million were sent from Binance to an unknown destination. XRP outflows from Binance are linked to the exchange’s opaque proof of reserves Hours apart, another 37,371,039 XRP worth $14 million moved from Binance to an unverified destination. Part of Binance’s outflows – which now amount to more than $1 billion – could partly be tied to the irregularities on the exchange’s recently declared proof of reserves by Mazars. The audit firm’s letter read: “we found that Binance was 97% collateralized without taking into account the Out-Of-Scope assets pledged by customers as collateral for In-Scope-Assets lent through the margin and loans service offering resulting in negative balances on the customer liability report. With the inclusion of In-Scope Assets lent to customers through margin and loans overcollateralized by Out-Of-Scope Assets, we found that Binance was 101% collateralized.“ Advertisement          Based on the report, industry experts are questioning why the exchange did not fully disclose its internal controls and their effectiveness. The former chief of the Securities Exchange Commission’s Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark, said: “Binance’s proof of reserve report does not address the effectiveness of internal financial controls, does not express an opinion or assurance conclusion and does not vouch for the numbers.” Mazars’ report – released on December 7 – showed that Binance’s Bitcoin reserves manage more than 575,742.42, worth $9.7 billion at the current price. The company has also advocated for the Merkle tree proof of reserves, letting users verify their assets – something experts term inadequate because it fails to include liabilities.                                            Ads by Cointraffic            ",2022-12-13

Rumors about trouble at FTX led to a $6 billion run on the company, allegations of gross malfeasance, and an eventual collapse into what John Ray III, the man charged with overseeing FTX's bankruptcy, called the most ""complete failure of corporate controls"" he's ever seen—and he's the guy who rode herd over the mega-bankruptcies of companies including Enron and Nortel.Questions about the role that Bankman-Fried and other executives played in FTX's fast, loose, and potentially illegal handling of investors' money arose almost immediately after the trouble at the company came to light. Bankman-Fried acknowledged in a lengthy Twitter thread that he ""fucked up, and should have done better,"" but has repeatedly denied knowingly taking part in fraud or any other criminal activity. But it's become clear more recently that, at the very least, there was a tremendous lack of oversight at the company: Records and money are both missing, and Ray, the man in charge of FTX's bankruptcy, said Bankman-Fried ""often communicated by using applications that were set to auto-delete after a short period of time, and encouraged employees to do the same."" In the world of corporate governance, that is a very, very bad sign.(Image credit: Sam Bankman-Fried (Twitter))The US Securities and Exchange Commission seems convinced that Bankman-Fried was up to no good. Today, the day after his arrest, the SEC formally charged him with fraud, and said that other securities law violations could be coming.""FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr. Bankman-Fried created by, among other things, touting its best-in-class controls, including a proprietary 'risk engine,' and FTX’s adherence to specific investor protection principles and detailed terms of service,"" Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said in a statement. ""But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.""""FTX's collapse highlights the very real risks that unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose for investors and customers alike. While we continue to investigate FTX and other entities and individuals for potential violations of the federal securities laws, as alleged in our complaint, today we are holding Mr. Bankman-Fried responsible for fraudulently raising billions of dollars from investors in FTX and misusing funds belonging to FTX's trading customers.""SEC chair Gary Gensler said Bankman-Fried ""built a house of cards on a foundation of deception,"" and said FTX's collapse is ""a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.""The SEC charges might be Bankman-Fried's biggest problem, but it's not the only one. The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also filed charges against him, and Prime Minister of the Bahamas Philip Davis said the country ""will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX.""On 12 December 2022, the Office of the Attorney General of The Bahamas is announcing the arrest by The Royal Bahamas Police Force of Sam Bankman-Fried (“SBF”), former CEO of FTX. pic.twitter.com/CRNeLPAbVpDecember 12, 2022See moreIt could be a while before this matter is resolved. According to Coindesk, Bankman-Fried said in a court hearing following his arrest that he is not waiving his right to fight extradition to the US.Along with all the investor cash lost, the collapse of FTX has also contributed to bitcoin miners defaulting on loans, leaving their financers, crypto companies such as NYDIG, with a bunch of mining rigs that have lost a lot of value since they were purchased.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.3%, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 1.0%.Stocks fluctuated throughout the day, paring significant early gains in the session before ending comfortably in the green. The session's jump came after data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics showed prices in November rose 0.1% over the prior month and 7.1% over the prior year.Tuesday's data was seen by investors as potentially encouraging for the Federal Reserve to ease off its aggressive rate hikes early next year. The Fed could start down a slowing rate-hike path as soon as Wednesday, when it concludes its two-day policy meeting and will announce its latest hike.“While this is the second consecutive month of softer-than-expected inflation, we don’t think this will change anything at tomorrow’s Fed meeting. We still expect a 50-basis-point hike, but what matters is guidance,"" Gina Bolvin, President, Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote in a statement following the inflation data. Following the inflation data and amid the subsequent stock rally, the dollar tumbled against most major currencies and bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged, rising as much as 5%.Yields rose, with the yield on 10-year Treasury notes up as much as 9 basis points to around to 3.52% Tuesday after dipping to 3.45% earlier in the session.Stocks had rallied Monday ahead of the inflation report, with the S&P 500 gaining 1.43% to kick off the new week, with energy, utilities, and tech outperforming.The rally continued early Tuesday as the consumer price data came in cooler than expected: Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected headline CPI to rise 7.3% over last year and 0.3% over the prior month.Meanwhile, core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy components, rose 6.0% year-over-year, down from the 6.1% annual increase seen in October. The data is the final piece of the puzzle before the Fed's final policy meeting of 2022, at which the central bank is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by another 0.50%.Story continues“Indeed, we don't get many days as important as the next two, and the US CPI today and the FOMC tomorrow are likely to be the difference between a big Santa Claus rally and a visit from Scrooge ahead of Christmas,” Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank wrote in an early-morning note Tuesday.In commodity markets, oil prices were higher, with WTI crude over 3% to around $75.41 per barrel, driven by China’s relaxation of COVID-related restrictions.On the corporate news front, United Airlines (UAL) has placed an order for 100 of Boeing's top-of-the-line 787 Dreamliners with options to purchase 100 more, according to a press release. Shares of United Airlines were down nearly 7% on Tuesday.Meanwhile, JetBlue (JBLU) shares tumbled after the company warned that demand is shaping up worse than expected. Another stock under pressure was Tesla (TSLA), as a 4% plunge sent the EV maker's market value below $500 billion.Moderna (MRNA) shares soared Tuesday after the company's mid-stage trial showed the combination of its experimental melanoma vaccine and Merck's (MRK) immunotherapy Keytruda lowered the risk of skin cancer's recurrence or death by 44%.Elsewhere, in the crypto world, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, was arrested on Monday in the Bahamas after the U.S. filed criminal charges.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, other defendants include a long list of celebrities deemed responsible for unrealistically hyping up the value of Yuga Labs’ intangible goods.A report by Deadline also pointed out that some of the defendants cited in the class action include Justin Bieber, Paris Hilton, Madonna, Jimmy Fallon, and Kevin Hart, among others.RelatedSnoop Dogg and Eminem’s Bored Ape music video is here to try and sell us on tokensSome of the specific charges include violations of unfair competition laws, aiding and abetting, and civil conspiracy, among others, but it is summarized fairly well in a quote from a 2017 article from the US Securities and Exchange Commission that states, “Celebrities and others are using social media networks to encourage the public to purchase stocks and other investments. These endorsements may be unlawful if they do not disclose the nature, source, and amount of any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, by the company in exchange for the endorsement.”The suit was filed alongside a wealth of evidence outlining how Yuga Labs used a service called MoonPay as an intermediary to compensate the people promoting the NFT collection. MoonPay is advertised as an NFT exchange for celebrities and other investors but was, according to the complaint, used as an avenue to compensate celebrity endorsements of Yuga Labs NFTs, without disclosing this information to investors. The complaint further details that MoonPay was started by Guy Oseary, a connected Hollywood talent agent who conspired with Yuga Labs to provide this intermediary.The plaintiffs are demanding a jury trial on these charges, requesting damages and restitution to be awarded to anyone who suffered financial losses by purchasing Yuga’s NFTs or Yuga’s cryptocurrency, ApeCoin, starting from April 23rd, 2021.

Reuters
In mid… [+5816 chars]",International Business Times,"In mid-2020, FTX's chief engineer made a secret change to the cryptocurrency exchange's software.He tweaked the code to exempt Alameda Research, a hedge fund owned by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, from a feature on the trading platform that would have automatically sold off Alameda's assets if it was losing too much borrowed money.In a note explaining the change, the engineer, Nishad Singh, emphasized that FTX should never sell Alameda's positions. ""Be extra careful not to liquidate,"" Singh wrote in the comment in the platform's code, which it showed he helped author. Reuters reviewed the code base, which has not been previously reported.The exemption allowed Alameda to keep borrowing funds from FTX irrespective of the value of the collateral securing those loans. That tweak in the code got the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged Bankman-Fried with fraud on Tuesday. The SEC said the tweak meant Alameda had a ""virtually unlimited line of credit."" Furthermore, the billions of dollars that FTX secretly lent to Alameda over the next two years didn't come from its own reserves, but rather were other FTX customers' deposits, the SEC said.The SEC and a spokesperson for Bankman-Fried declined to comment for this story. Singh did not respond to several requests for comment.The regulator, which called the exchange ""a house of cards,""  alleged Bankman-Fried concealed that FTX diverted customer funds to Alameda in order to make undisclosed venture investments, luxury real estate purchases, and political donations. U.S. prosecutors and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed separate criminal and civil charges, respectively.The complaints - along with previously unreported FTX documents seen by Reuters and three people familiar with the crypto exchange - provide new insights into how Bankman-Fried dipped into customer funds and spent billions more than FTX was making without the knowledge of investors, its customers and most employees.Police in the Bahamas, where FTX was based, arrested Bankman-Fried on Monday evening, capping a stunning fall from grace for the 30-year-old former billionaire. His company collapsed in November after users rushed to withdraw deposits and investors shunned his requests for more financing. FTX declared bankruptcy on Nov. 11 and Bankman-Fried resigned as chief executive.Bankman-Fried has apologized to customers, but said he didn't personally think he had any criminal liability.The auto-liquidation exemption written into FTX code allowed Alameda to continually increase its line of credit until it ""grew to tens of billions of dollars and effectively became limitless,"" the SEC complaint said. It was one of two ways that Bankman-Fried diverted customer funds to Alameda.The other was a mechanism whereby FTX customers deposited over $8 billion in traditional currency into bank accounts secretly controlled by Alameda. These deposits were reflected in an internal account on FTX that was not tied to Alameda, which concealed its liability, the complaint said.""SAFE, TESTED AND CONSERVATIVE""As Bankman-Fried grew FTX into one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, consumer protection was a central tenet of his pitch for crypto regulation in the United States. Bankman-Fried stressed this theme in countless statements to customers, investors, regulators and lawmakers. FTX's auto-liquidation software would protect everyone, he explained.In congressional testimony on May 12, he called FTX's software ""safe, tested and conservative.""""By quickly unwinding the riskiest, most undercollateralized positions, the risk engine prevents build-up of credit risk that could otherwise cascade beyond the platform, resulting in contagion,"" Bankman-Fried testified.He did not tell lawmakers about the software change to exempt Alameda. Indeed, he told investors that Alameda received no preferential treatment from FTX, the SEC complaint said.Bankman-Fried had directed subordinates to update the software in mid-2020 to enable Alameda to maintain a negative balance on its account, the SEC complaint said. No other customer account at Alameda was allowed to do so, the complaint added. This would allow Alameda to keep borrowing more FTX funds without the need to provide more collateral.In software tweaks made in August 2020, Alameda was designated as the ""Primary Market Maker"" or ""PMM,"" according to a Reuters review of its codebase. Market makers are dealers who enable trading in an asset by standing ready to buy and sell it.To explain the change, Singh, the chief engineer, inserted a comment into the code: ""Alameda would be liquidating, prevented."" He included a warning ""not to liquidate the PMM.""Only Singh, Bankman-Fried and a few other top FTX and Alameda executives knew about the exemption in the code, according to three former executives briefed on the matter. A digital dashboard used by staff to track FTX customer assets and liabilities was programmed so it would not take into account that Alameda had withdrawn the client funds, according to two of the people and a screenshot of the portal that Reuters has previously reported.Bankman-Fried's house of cards ""began to crumble"" in May 2022, the SEC complaint said.As the value of crypto tokens plummeted that month, several of Alameda's lenders demanded repayment. Since Alameda didn't have the funds to meet these requests, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda to tap its ""line of credit"" with FTX to obtain billions of dollars in financing, the complaint said.Ultimately, when FTX customers dashed to withdraw their money this November, spooked by media reports about the company's financial health, many discovered that their funds were no longer there.",2022-12-13

Instead, he sat in a Bahamian jail, arrested on Monday night by authorities at the behest of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Despite Bankman-Fried’s notable absence, the hearing went forward, with the committee—chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.)—grilling FTX’s new CEO, John Ray III, for nearly four hours.   Ray is a famously private man, with publications struggling to find up-to-date photos of him when he took over as CEO in the early morning of Nov. 11, days after FTX had stopped processing withdrawals. His previous claim to fame was overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of Enron, although he quickly established that FTX’s failure was unprecedented—a fact referenced frequently during the hearing.  “I’ve done probably a dozen large-scale bankruptcies over my career,” said the soft-spoken Ray. “This one is unusual.”  ‘Garden of snakes’ Waters and ranking member Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) are an odd match, with McHenry noting in his opening remarks that this was the first bipartisan hearing the committee had held in four years. Nevertheless, the two have united on the need for crypto legislation—one reason the committee insisted on holding what became the second congressional hearing on FTX. Even without the scheduled star witness, the hearing produced sparks, splitting some of the more outspoken members into two distinct camps: crypto skeptics and advocates. The former counted among them Reps. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) and Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), with both questioning the technology and the clear harm it’s caused, citing the collapse of companies such as FTX and the loss of billions in customer funds. “My fear is that we will view Sam Bankman-Fried as just one big snake in a crypto Garden of Eden,” said Sherman. “The fact is, crypto is a garden of snakes.” On the other side were representatives including McHenry, Tom Emmer (R-Ind.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), and Ted Budd (R-N.C.), who mostly spent their five allotted minutes criticizing the Securities and Exchange Commission for its failure to prevent FTX and calling for legislation.   McHenry, who will become the chair of the committee when the Republicans take control of the House next year, opened the hearing by differentiating the FTX fiasco from crypto as a whole.   “We have to separate out the bad actions of an individual from the good created by an industry and innovation,” he said, ending with an ominous warning to SEC chair Gary Gensler. “Next year, I look forward to hearing from Mr. Gensler early and often.” More questions than answers  The majority of representatives took more of a middle-ground approach, interrogating Ray about everything from the actions of the Bahamian government to FTX’s endorsement deals.   The House Financial Services Committee has over 50 members. Not every congressperson was present—and by the end of the hearing, the room was nearly empty—but the event still dragged on as many members asked Ray questions that were unlikely to elicit an answer, such as which regulatory body he thought was best equipped to oversee crypto.  The hearing also had moments of levity, including when Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) asked Mr. Ray if he would support his provision to change the word “cryptocurrency” to “creepy dough.” (Ray answered that he would leave it to the committee). Crypto points (as made up as FTT) went to Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) for asking about the implications of in-the-weeds tokens like Serum and were taken away from Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) for pronouncing Dogecoin as “dogey-coin.”  As committee members pried for more details into the spectacular collapse and Hollywood-ready descent of Bankman-Fried, the recurring theme was the utter incompetence of the previous FTX executive team. Ray backed up his claim that FTX’s failure was unlike any bankruptcy he had seen, laying out how a company once valued at $32 billion used the accounting software QuickBooks and approved invoices over Slack. After Bankman-Fried’s arrest at the hands of Bahamian authorities, Ray also helped shed light on the FTX founder’s seemingly cozy dealings with the country’s government, including opening withdrawals from Bahamian accounts even as they were paused everywhere else. Ray said that during this period, which was right before he took over as CEO and initiated bankruptcy proceedings, FTX processed $100 million in withdrawals for around 1,500 Bahamian accounts—a revelation that raised eyebrows for committee members.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez laid out the timeline of FTX’s collapse up until Bankman-Fried’s arrest, pointing to signs that he was receiving preferential treatment from the Bahamian government.   The main takeaway that Ray stressed was that his team was still unraveling Bankman-Fried’s web of deceit, which was often difficult to separate from incompetence. When asked by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) how much FTX had left to repay to customers, Ray answered that he was still finding new assets every day because of the poor management and controls. FTX was “a company uniquely destined to fail,” Ray said.Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter examines how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today's executives.

New research released today indicates that Cuba has been using pieces of malware in its attacks that were certified, or given a seal of approval, by Microsoft.Cuba used these cryptographically signed “drivers” after compromising a target's systems as part of efforts to disable security scanning tools and change settings. The activity was meant to fly under the radar, but it was flagged by monitoring tools from the security firm Sophos. Researchers from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 previously observed Cuba signing a privileged piece of software known as a “kernel driver” with an NVIDIA certificate that was leaked earlier this year by the Lapsus$ hacking group. And Sophos says it has also seen the group use the strategy with compromised certificates from at least one other Chinese tech company, which security firm Mandiant identified as Zhuhai Liancheng Technology Co. “Microsoft was recently informed that drivers certified by Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Developer Program were being used maliciously in post-exploitation activity,” the company said in a security advisory today. “Several developer accounts for the Microsoft Partner Center were engaged in submitting malicious drivers to obtain a Microsoft signature … The signed malicious drivers were likely used to facilitate post-exploitation intrusion activity such as the deployment of ransomware.”Sophos notified Microsoft about the activity on October 19 along with Mandiant and security firm SentinelOne. Microsoft says it has suspended the Partner Center accounts that were being abused, revoked the rogue certificates, and released security updates for Windows related to the situation. The company adds that it hasn't identified any compromise of its systems beyond the partner account abuse.Microsoft declined WIRED's request to comment beyond the advisory.“These attackers, most likely affiliates of the Cuba ransomware group, know what they’re doing—and they’re persistent,"" says Christopher Budd, director of threat research at Sophos. “We’ve found a total of 10 malicious drivers, all variants of the initial discovery. These drivers show a concerted effort to move up the trust chain, starting at least this past July. Creating a malicious driver from scratch and getting it signed by a legitimate authority is difficult. However, it’s incredibly effective, because the driver can essentially carry out any processes without question.""Most PopularCultureTaylor Swift and Beyoncé Are Resurrecting the American Movie TheaterAngela WatercutterBusinessSam Bankman-Fried Built a Crypto Paradise in the Bahamas—Now He's a Bad MemoryJoel KhaliliScienceHere’s the Truth Behind the Biggest (and Dumbest) Battery MythsGrace BrowneGearThe Best iPhone 15 Cases and AccessoriesJulian ChokkattuCryptographic software signing is an important validation mechanism meant to ensure that software has been vetted and anointed by a trusted party or “certificate authority.” Attackers are always looking for weaknesses in this infrastructure, though, where they can compromise certificates or otherwise undermine and abuse the signing process to legitimize their malware. “Mandiant has previously observed scenarios when it is suspected that groups leverage a common criminal service for code signing,” the company wrote in a report published today. “The use of stolen or fraudulently obtained code signing certificates by threat actors has been a common tactic, and providing these certificates or signing services has proven a lucrative niche in the underground economy.”Earlier this month, Google published findings that a number of compromised “platform certificates” managed by Android device makers including Samsung and LG had been used to sign malicious Android apps distributed through third-party channels. It appears that at least some of the compromised certificates were used to sign components of the Manuscrypt remote access tool. The FBI and CISA have previously attributed activity associated with the Manuscrypt malware family to North Korean state-backed hackers targeting cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges.“In 2022, we’ve seen ransomware attackers increasingly attempting to bypass endpoint detection and response products of many, if not most, major vendors,” Sophos' Budd says. “The security community needs to be aware of this threat so that they can implement additional security measures. What’s more, we may see other attackers attempt to emulate this type of attack.”With so many compromised certificates flying around, it seems that many attackers have already gotten the memo about shifting toward this strategy.",2022-12-13

Subject to approval from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023. Bitcoin Group SE announced in October that it was in negotiations with several banks, including Bankhaus von der Heydt. Bloomberg reported at the time that privately owned Bankhaus von der Heydt had wanted to launch digital asset trading and custody services, in an attempt to regain profitability, but was unable to finance the technology needed on its own. The bank did succeed in launching a euro-denominated stablecoin, EURB, in 2020, but Know Your Customer regulations prevented the coin from being traded openly.

However, the situation changed on Dec. 13 after Ether failed to break the $1,350 resistance.As the 60-day delta skew stands at 14%, whales and market makers are reluctant to offer downside protection, which seems odd considering that ETH is trading at its highest level in 32 days.

Rather, he was tapped to lead the company through its bankruptcy proceedings. Ray, who oversaw the Enron bankruptcy liquidation—an effort to return as much money as possible to investors, lenders, and customers—has not parsed words about Bankman-Fried in the past.“Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” Ray wrote in a court filing (pdf) on Nov. 17. Given that Ray oversaw the Enron bankruptcy, his words were striking.Ray isn’t finished liquidating FTX’s assets. And he apparently isn’t finished excoriating Bankman-Fried either.AdvertisementEnron was much more sophisticated than FTX FTX and Enron are two very different companies, Ray noted. Enron used accounting loopholes and various corporate entities to hide billions of dollars in debt. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2001, and has become synonymous with corporate fraud in the two decades since. Ray said that FTX, meanwhile, was far less sophisticated in its alleged financial crimes.“Enron was a very different company,” he said in response to one lawmaker’s question. “Crimes that were committed there were highly orchestrated financial machinations by highly sophisticated people to keep transactions off balance sheets.” Regarding FTX, he said: “This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purposes.”Ray also blasted Bankman-Fried’s lack of accounting measures (“literally there’s no record keeping whatsoever”) and the company’s use of Intuit’s personal accounting software Quickbooks (“I have nothing against QuickBooks, but it’s not for a multi-billion dollar company”).AdvertisementBankman-Fried’s attorney, Mark Cohen, did not respond to a request for comment about Ray’s allegations of embezzlement.",2022-12-13

A representative for Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ray’s testimony. Ray said he was shocked to learn FTX was using Quickbooks – software geared towards small and mid-size businesses – for accounting and approving invoices via Slack messages. Asked why he had testified that he did not believe the audited financial statements were reliable, Ray said: “We’ve lost $8bn of customer money. So by definition, I don’t trust a single piece of paper in this organisation.” It will take weeks, perhaps months, to secure all the group’s assets, Ray said, warning it would be a lengthy process. “At the end of the day, we’re not going to be able to recover all the losses here,” he said. ‘Old-fashioned embezzlement’ Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday evening in the Bahamas and appeared before a magistrate Tuesday. US federal prosecutors on Tuesday alleged he committed fraud and violated campaign finance laws. The former FTX CEO also faces additional charges by US regulators. The Bahamas attorney-general’s office said it expects Bankman-Fried will be extradited to the US. During Tuesday’s hearing, Bankman-Fried indicated to a magistrate judge in the Bahamas that he would fight extradition, according to a Reuters news agency witness. Ray said FTX would cooperate in turning over information to authorities and that he had already shared some findings of his internal investigation into the collapse of the company with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors. Since he took over as CEO, Ray said he has established that customer assets at FTX were commingled with those of Alameda Research. Client funds were used to engage in margin trading, which exposed customers to significant losses, he said, calling the practice “old-fashioned embezzlement”. Ray said in his testimony on Tuesday that he had hired a new chief financial officer, a head of human resources and administration, and a head of information technology. He also appointed a board of directors, which is chaired by former judge Joseph Farnan. Ray also told legislators that FTX will look to sell its crypto derivatives exchange LedgerX, which is regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and was not included in the bankruptcy proceedings. Bankman-Fried had also been scheduled to appear before the committee on Tuesday and his testimony had been highly anticipated. “Unfortunately, the timing of his arrest denies the public the opportunity to get the answers they deserve,” said the panel’s chair, Democratic US Representative Maxine Waters. “Rest assured that this committee will not stop until we uncover the full truth behind the collapse of FTX just a few months ago.” Representative Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, described “old-school fraud” behind the fancy trappings of cryptocurrency trading at FTX. “Fraud and fraudsters have been around just as long as that phrase has been around,” he said. “It appears to be the same old-school fraud – just using new technology.” ",2022-12-13

On page eighteen of the indictment, Bankman-Fried was charged with “knowingly and willfully” donating to federal candidates, along with political action committees, in the name of other persons and corporate entities over the threshold of $25,000 in one calendar year.   A part of the indictment reads: It was a further part and object of the conspiracy that SAMUEL BANKMAN-FRIED, a/k/a “SBF,” the defendant, and others known and unknown, would and did knowingly and willfully make contributions to candidates for federal office, joint fundraising committees, and independent expenditure committees in the names of other persons, aggregating to $25,000 and more in a calendar year, in violation of Title 52, United States Code, Sections 30122 and 30209(d) (1) (A) & (D).

Many have claimed that they even have the potential to ‘kill’ Ethereum, as they burst onto the scene with some unique capabilities while also supporting decentralised applications (dApps). However, things have changed in recent times. Plenty of investors now believe that Metacade, a project built on Ethereum, has much higher long-term potential. Failed Assassinations Cardano and Solana were once referred to as ‘ETH Killers.’ Despite the hype, they’ve both struggled to subdue the world’s biggest Web3 ecosystem so far. Both chains could offer higher transaction throughput and much cheaper fees, so why exactly have they failed in their attempt to knock Ethereum off its perch? The 2 ecosystems themselves are home to many different projects. Additionally, they can both offer NFTs as well as all kinds of decentralised finance (DeFi) services. The problem is that not as many people seem to want to use these services when compared with projects based on Ethereum. What is Solana (SOL)? Solana (SOL) has been touted as a next-generation, high-performance blockchain. The network enables developers to build decentralised applications that are scalable, secure, and efficient, utilising a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to reduce energy costs and increase transaction speeds. However, the network has regularly experienced failure during its first 2 years of being active. Between June 2021 and June 2022, the Solana blockchain switched off 7 times. Since blockchains are supposed to be available 24/7/365, this has caused many investors to lose faith in the ecosystem. To compare, Bitcoin has been running continuously for 9 years straight. What is Cardano (ADA)? Cardano (ADA) has a similar offering to Solana but has had a much better track record in terms of network resilience. The key difference between Cardano and other networks is that it was the first blockchain to be developed through peer-reviewed research. The ADA team is currently developing a new scalability solution for the network called Hydra. When this update goes live, it is expected that Cardano will be able to process up to 1,000,000 transactions per second (TPS), which is a monumental improvement on Ethereum’s, even after ‘The Merge’ increased ETH’s amount from 15 TPS to 100,000. High promise, low demand While both Solana and Cardano looked destined to ‘flip’ Ethereum in terms of market cap, this prediction has so far been wide of the mark. For Cardano, there are currently only 70,000 active wallet addresses, which is less than a tenth of Ethereum’s total. dApps built on Ethereum have a unique advantage when it comes to users rates, because more people want to use the ecosystem. A project that looks set to take advantage of Ethereum’s integrated benefits is Metacade. Metacade: Vast Usership Potential Investors have started to look deeper into Metacade for a number of key reasons. The project is a brand-new play-to-earn ecosystem that is inherently community-focused and offers some amazing benefits to members. As GameFi looks set to expand throughout a 3-billion-person market and conquer the gaming industry itself, projects like Metacade are extremely well-positioned to attract a large number of users. Considering that Metacade is a whole gaming arcade instead of a single title, this looks more than possible. Community Initiatives For players, it can often be difficult to find the latest (and most valuable) information to get the most out of their blockchain-playing experience. Metacade solves this problem by creating a hub for the gaming community to share all that they know, including the latest game developments and playing techniques. On top of this, Metacade will provide MCADE token rewards to users for sharing their knowledge with the community. The platform incentivises a strong relationship between players and gives them more opportunities to earn in the process. Owned by players Metacade has plans to become a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), which is another feature that looks set to attract a large number of users to the platform. MCADE holders can vote on how the platform will operate in the future, as the Metacade platform gives more power back to gamers with the aim of developing the GameFi industry itself. One key method that Metacade aims to help the GameFi industry grow is through the Metagrants program. Players can get together, vote, and decide which new P2E titles should be created in the future. After reviewing proposals that are submitted by talented development teams, the Metacade community can fund them directly to facilitate their creation. SOL vs ADA vs MCADE: This is what investors are thinking Since Solana has struggled to stay up and Cardano is underdelivering in terms of its userbase, neither project has managed to ‘kill’ Ethereum. In fact, Ethereum has just completed ‘The Merge’ and now offers similar transaction throughput to its competitors. Since the ecosystem is significantly bigger in terms of users, it has a large competitive advantage. Metacade, built on Ethereum, is well-positioned for explosive growth. Not only can it offer users from Ethereum some unique benefits, but the platform also offers a range of play-to-earn games in its arcade. The MCADE token has only just started its presale event, which means it has very high potential. Projects like Metacade can be keystone projects that links the wider industry together. It is extremely attractive to gamers, and investors who are starting to think that it could have a much better future when compared to major names such as Solana and Cardano. The MCADE token is being released for just $0.008 in its initial round of investment. At later stages of the presale, this will rise to $0.02. If you’re reading this, you can get involved and access some major gains before the token goes live to the public later this year. You can participate in the MCADE presale here.

The consumer price index increased 0.1% last month after advancing 0.4% in October, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3%.               The slowdown could give the Federal Reserve cover to start scaling back the size of its interest rate increases on Wednesday.               ""This month's report provides confirmation of October's step down in inflation pressures and is welcome news for the Fed,"" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a note on Tuesday morning.               ""Tomorrow's reduction in the pace of tightening to 50 (basis points) was already telegraphed, and with the downtrend in inflation becoming entrenched, the FOMC can set its sights squarely on the labor market.""               Wall Street stocks jumped on the news in morning trading but then pulled back to more modest gains by the afternoon.               The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.3%, the S&P 500 gained 0.74% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1%. Winners included energy stocks and Moderna Inc , which surged nearly 20% on promising skin cancer vaccine study results.               The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.3% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained about 1%, a pullback from larger gains earlier in the day.               ""It was good news on the inflation front, but the equity market is giving back gains as it reflects on, 'what now?'"" Yung-Yu Ma, BMO Wealth Management's Chief Investment Strategist, said in an email.               ""It's all a balancing act, which we believe points to near-term choppy markets even though the improving inflation backdrop adds a positive bias.""BOND YIELDS, DOLLAR DIP               U.S. Treasury yields dropped on the November inflation data.               The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 9.2 basis points to 3.519%; 30-year yields fell 3.2 basis points to 3.544%, and two-year yields, which typically move in step with interest rate expectations, dropped 16.4 basis points to 4.239%.               The dollar also declined, dropping nearly 1% against a basket of major currencies. It is now down more than 5% over the last three months on investor belief that U.S. inflation has peaked.               The pound gained against the dollar, up about 0.75% to $1.236. Data showed a rise in UK unemployment and an increase in wage growth that will keep Bank of England (BoE) policymakers on edge when they meet this week.               The BoE, Fed and European Central Bank are expected to raise rates by 50 basis points (bps), rather than the 75 bps hikes they delivered earlier in the year.               ""If data such as today's suggest a real trend that the momentum of inflation is lower, we could then see the Fed pause over the next few months at a still restrictive policy-rate, but not one which would put potentially excessive pressure on the economy,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, said in a statement.               Traders are now betting on 25-basis-point increases at each of the Fed's first two meetings of 2023 and no more, with some chance the last hike could come in May instead of March, bringing the policy rate to between 4.75% and 5%.COMMODITIES UP               Oil rallied for a second day, having jumped 2.5% on Monday, with U.S. crude up 3.12% to $75.45 per barrel and Brent at $80.68, up 3.45% on the day. The market was buoyed by concern about supply disruptions, including the ongoing shutdown of the Canada-to-U.S. Keystone crude pipeline following a massive leak.               Gold, which is sensitive to shifts in U.S. inflation, also gained, with spot gold up 1.6% to $1,810.26 an ounce and U.S. gold futures up 1.77% to $1,813.90 an ounce.               In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin climbed around 3.4% to $17,750, and crypto-related stocks gained, even as FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged by U.S. regulators, and Binance registered $1.9 billion of withdrawals in the past 24 hours.

Bankman-Fried's attorneys initally asked the judge to consider that he be released on a $250,000 bail, arguing he needed to be able to regularly take medication, including Zyrtec, an over-the-counter allergy medication, and keep to his vegan diet. Earlier in the day, police escorted Bankman-Fried's parents to his home in Albany in the Bahamas to pick up Adderall, another medication.Bankman-Fried testified on Tuesday that he uses Emsam patches for depression, as well as 10 mg of Adderall every four hours.Prosecutors in the Bahamas argued that granting Bankman-Fried bail would go against a treaty with the U.S., which required defendants to be held in custody pending extradition proceedings. Bankman-Fried told the judge he would not waive his right to fight the extradition effort, suggesting he may seek to remain in the Bahamas.Read more: Inside Sam Bankman-Fried's First Bahamas Court Hearing After His ArrestBankman-Fried was arrested Monday evening after prosecutors in the U.S. alerted the Royal Bahamas Police Force of a sealed indictment. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed the indictment earlier on Tuesday, announcing that officials were charging the former FTX CEO with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and campaign violation allegations, among others.""One month ago FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, collapsed, destroying billions of dollars in customer value, and for every day of the past month, the dedicated prosecutors of this office and our partners [in the] FBI, [Securities and Exchange Commission] and [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] have been working around the clock to figure out what happened and to begin the process of seeking justice,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. ""This morning, we unsealed an eight-count indictment charging Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, with a series of interrelated fraud schemes that contributed to FTX's collapse.""A grand jury in the U.S. indicted Bankman-Fried last Friday and an arrest warrant was executed Monday, Williams said.In addition to the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC and CFTC sued Bankman-Fried Tuesday on various securities and commodities fraud charges.Government officials in the Bahamas are pursuing their own civil and criminal investigations into Bankman-Fried and FTX.Flight riskHis lawyer, Jerome Roberts, argued that Bankman-Fried was not a flight risk, citing his ownership of real estate in the Bahamas, as well as the fact that he had been in possession of his passport for at least three weeks before his arrest on Monday, and could have left the country at any time (Roberts told the court on Tuesday that ""when it became clear that local police had no interest in Mr. Bankman-Fried, they released his passport to me""). Roberts also added that electronic monitoring and other methods could be used to keep him in the country, and that if he tried to take a flight or boat out of the country, police could be there in ""minutes"" to arrest him.Judge Ferguson-Pratt pushed back, telling Roberts that a determined individual could find a way to flee the country.""If you sat where I sit, with the number of bail violations that come before me, you would understand [my concerns],"" she said.Roberts asked her if Bankman-Fried was not traveling via ""air or by sea"" how he could leave the country.Ferguson-Pratt smiled coyly: ""I do not wish to put that into the public domain.""The judge asked Roberts what he thought an appropriate figure for cash bail would be.""You have opened the door and I don't see why I shouldn't walk in,"" she said. ""When you say cash bail, what number comes to your mind?""""I hope Mr. Bankman-Fried doesn't crucify me for saying this,"" Roberts said. ""But given the circumstances, perhaps $250,000? But your honor doesn't have to agree with me. If $50,000 is a good figure, then $50,000 is a good figure.""Bankman-Fried's parents began talking audibly and smiling widely at the mention of $50,000 bail.But prosecutors pushed back, and reminded the judge that Bankman-Fried's Bahamian real estate wasn't a sufficient tie to the country because, if found guilty of the crimes he has been accused of, the property could potentially be clawed back to repay investors. They also reminded the judge that Bankman-Fried has ""extensive ties"" to foreign countries and cities, including Hong Kong, China, where he initially set up Alameda Research, and had told at least one witness that he was ""ready to relocate"" to a country in the Middle East.Bail deniedJudge Ferguson-Pratt ultimately decided to deny Bankman-Fried's bail application, telling the court that she did not believe that Bankman-Fried's apartment or the prospect of forfeiting a cash bond would keep him from fleeing.""It's a subjective test, and it depends on how much one is willing to lose,"" Ferguson-Pratt said.""I am of the view that the risk of flight is so great that Mr. Bankman-Fried ought to be remanded to custody,"" she said.Bankman-Fried, sitting alone in the first row of benches, slumped over at the news and held his head in his hands.Until his extradition hearing on Feb. 8, Bankman-Fried will be held at the Bahamas' notorious Fox Hill prison, where conditions are known to be dangerous and cramped. Locals told CoinDesk that the prison is overcrowded, with as many as six people to a cell, and often has issues with potable water.UPDATE (Dec. 13, 2022, 22:55 UTC): Adds additional detail and information.",2022-12-13

The move could make it easier for developers to build apps around NFTs and broaden the ability to make crypto payments through iPhones and iPads. Your Web3 Gaming Power-UpEnjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership PassDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.Discover SCENEApple’s “walled garden” ecosystem design has enabled it to take up to a 30% cut of iOS app and service sales, to the frustration of users and creators alike. But a new report suggests that Apple is planning to open up its ecosystem—a move that may benefit apps built around NFTs and possibly expand the ability to make mobile crypto payments.Bloomberg reports that Apple plans to enable the installation of apps from external sources outside of its own App Store on iPhones and iPads, according to sources familiar with the plans. The changes are being made in response to the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, which requires tech companies to fully comply with restrictions by 2024.ADADAccording to the report, the rollout of support for external apps from third-party sources and marketplaces will initially begin only in Europe to comply with the new law. However, the functionality could be expanded to other territories depending on whether those countries adopt similar regulations.Apple is reportedly aiming to launch the feature in its iOS 17 software update, which is expected to launch next fall based on the typical annual release schedule.The company is still weighing whether to allow third-party apps to use their own payments infrastructure, Bloomberg claims, rather than force developers to route payments through Apple’s own payments setup. That particular shift, if implemented, could make it much easier to spend cryptocurrency through iPhone and iPad apps.The reported changes come amid growing pushback to Apple’s closed ecosystem, which not only philosophically clashes with Web3’s decentralized ethos but also has led to restrictions around the ways that apps can utilize NFT assets. In October, Apple updated its developer guidelines to state that NFTs cannot be used to gate access to features or content within apps.NFT purchases are also subject to Apple’s 30% fee—a potentially impossible limitation to enforce on secondary market sales, at least. The iOS apps for marketplaces like OpenSea and Magic Eden only allow users to browse NFTs, not buy or sell them through the app.Apple’s NFT rule changes have caused havoc with existing iOS apps as well. Coinbase recently announced that it had to disable NFT transfers through its mobile Wallet app, as Apple said that users would have to pay 30% of any network gas fee (like on Ethereum) for the action. Coinbase described that demand as “not possible” to implement.ADADDan Finlay, co-founder of popular crypto wallet app MetaMask and a former Apple employee, tweeted in support of Coinbase, calling out Apple’s “abuse of monopoly.” He suggested that MetaMask could be next to be impacted by Apple’s rules, and added, “I'll absolutely stand in solidarity here.”Apple’s reported upcoming plans to open up its ecosystem could benefit NFT and crypto apps that are currently limited or hobbled by App Store requirements. Such apps could then be installed via external sources and not be reliant on Apple’s strict policies, although Bloomberg reports that Apple may institute additional “security requirements” for outside apps.The move could also benefit the growing Web3 metaverse, as Apple is widely reported to be developing a mixed reality headset that may debut sometime in 2023. Many Web3 developers are building towards a metaverse defined by interoperability between platforms, using NFTs to represent ownership of assets that can be freely used across spaces.Web3 developers aren’t alone in griping about Apple’s current model. Epic Games sued Apple—as well as Google with its Android Play Store—after the tech giant blocked its popular Fortnite game over the addition of a third-party payments model.A previous court decision that could have forced Apple to allow third-party payments was ultimately delayed, and the companies are still embroiled in the legal battle. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted about today's report, pressing lawmakers to pass similar legislation to potentially force Apple to open up its ecosystem in the United States as well. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg, says Apple is preparing to open iOS to competing app stores - but only in Europe. This would leave American developers in serfdom in the nation where Apple was founded. Congress must pass the Open Apps Market Act! https://t.co/GnCChgi0hX — Possibly Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) December 13, 2022If external apps are only allowed in Europe, it ""would leave American developers in serfdom in the nation where Apple was founded,"" Sweeney tweeted. ""Congress must pass the Open Apps Market Act!""New Twitter owner Elon Musk also recently complained about Apple’s policies, and tweeted asking if Apple “[hates] free speech” after the firm cut its ad spending on the social media platform. Musk also alleged that Apple was considering removing the Twitter app, but later chalked it up to a “misunderstanding” after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook.ADADStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.Your EmailGet it!Get it!Copy link",2022-12-13

Still, bitcoin (BTC-USD) saw some solid upside momentum, climbing 3.4% to $17.75K at 5:03 p.m. ET, after the highly-anticipated November CPI report showed that headline and core consumer prices moderated more than expected. Those cooler than expected inflation prints potentially paves the way for a less aggressive interest-rate increase at the Fed's meeting on Wednesday.  It's relatively unusual to see MARA slide and BTC rise, or vice versa, given their strong historical relationship. The Quant system flagged MARA at high risk of performing badly in mid-November due to inferior profitability and decelerating momentum.

But his indictment and subsequent arrest Monday night obviously canceled his planned appearance. And within hours, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have now piled on for additional civil actions against SBF.  SEC charges Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors in now-bankrupt FTX    Yes, he and the executives at FTX/Alameda f—ed up. But these failures are not in a vacuum. He was allowed to f—up by a system that has ignored the need for regulatory guidance and oversight in a time of unprecedented financial innovation.     “ The SEC and the CFTC failed FTX, its investors, and the crypto community as a whole. ”                          John J. Ray III, the new chief executive of FTX, testified in front of a House committee Tuesday on the collapse of the crypto exchange. His testimony came less than a day after the company founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was arrested in the Bahamas. Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg News            Historically, the U.S. financial sector is one of the most regulated environments in the world. The SEC, CFTC, FTC, Fed, FDIC, OCC, and CFPB, as well as numerous self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) all have their hands on the regulation of financial products and services, with the general goals of investor and consumer protection, financial stability, market efficiency, competition, the prevention of financial crime, and fairness. Dusty rule books But these regulations were drafted decades ago and are framed on the so-called “traditional” bricks-and-mortar banks and an investing community of high-price brokers and sophisticated, wealthy investors. With the rise of cryptocurrency, the crypto investment community has significantly grown, and both sophisticated and novice investors have joined the fray.  Also read: ‘Crypto is a garden of snakes,’ Democrat says as Congress probes FTX fallout With several high-profile issues with exchanges and wallets and the associated public outcry, new regulation was inevitable. But the FTX debacle shocked the world and will likely significantly quicken the regulation. How it will affect the crypto investment community depends on what that regulation looks like. Ultimately FTX was unsurprising, as it shows that there is a significant hole in crypto exchange transparency. It also shows the fragile nature of crypto and the risk/reward for those that are looking for alternative investments. The unreliable financials and questionable leadership outlined today in the congressional hearing were shielded by the unregulated environment that also led to significant gains in the past few years.  Lukas I. Alpert: A framework for fraud: How FTX was a scam from the very beginning FTX is a reminder of the need for due diligence, and a true understanding of a business that is necessary for solid investments. And even strong due diligence can fail an investment into what may look like a solid company with a shaky foundation.  FTX fallout continues with Bankman-Fried arrest. But where is former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison?Don’t overregulate This, however, is dangerous territory for the regulators. A hasty attempt to rein in every potential for wrongdoing or anticipated event would likely fail and cause more damage than good to the investing community. Conversely, a well-designed regulatory scheme that aims to affect the bad actors only and not overregulate the technology that has allowed greater market access would likely be a positive. And this would require a collaborative effort between legislators, regulators, and the industry. It’s too early to tell what the regulators will do with cryptocurrency exchanges, but traditionally, the regulators lag in rulemaking and policy in unexplored areas of innovation. With this lag, the agencies must turn to regulation by enforcement, which is frustrating to industry participants and their lawyers. Rules and guidance should be sufficient for companies to know the who, what, and how the industry is regulated. So, where were the regulators? There has been the occasional enforcement action against cryptocurrency companies. But there is no guidance nor plan for the regulators to rein in control of the actions of FTX-like entities that operate offshore for a reason yet pull in investment dollars from hedge funds and celebrities located on U.S. soil.  For an innovative financial company, in crypto or otherwise, the lack of guidance is deafening. Be it a lack of understanding, a continuing turf war, or political motivation, the SEC and the CFTC failed FTX, its investors, and the crypto community as a whole. SBF f—d up. But he was allowed to by an antiquated regime. It’s time the regulators focus on the future and not be caught in the past. Braden Perry is a regulatory and enforcement attorney.

Ray III, CEO of the FTX Group, sat as a witness on a hearing entitled “Investigating the collapse of FTX, Part I.”Sam Bankman-Fried was scheduled to attend the hearing but was unable to do so following his arrest. Late on Dec. 13 news broke that SBF had been denied bail after his lawyer argued that his history of depression and ADD warranted his release into custody.Addressing the committee, Ray described the FTX situation as the result of the following:“A small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company entrusted with other peoples money or assets.”Ray said that it “immediately became clear” to him that he needed to file for Chapter 11, and he has since taken “meaningful steps” to regain “command and control” of the situation.Ray’s testimony was revealed before the hearing, which was covered by CryptoSlate earlier in the day.Questions from the House highlightsMrs. Wagnar questioned Ray on his past comments describing the FTX debacle as “worse than Enron.”Ray responded by saying that “literally there’s no recordkeeping whatsoever. It’s the absence of recordkeeping.”Ray detailed that the recordkeeping was managed using  Slack for invoicing/expenses and via Quickbooks.“Nothing against Quickbooks, very nice tool, just not for a multi-billion dollar company. There’s no independent board. We had one person really controlling this.”Wagner questioned Ray on whether SBF could have transferred customer funds to Alameda as a “mistake.” Ray responded, stating that he did not find “any such statements credible.”Bankruptcy attorney and chair of the subcommittee on consumer, protection, and financial institutions, Mr. Perlmutter, highlighted a concern that Ray’s job is to:“Gather as many assets as you can and that could be from some very innocent people who got paid money to then spread it out equally among who you think the real creditors are.”In response to the concern, Ray detailed the complexity of determining the “ins and out” situation due to the “comingling of assets.“That makes it a bit more complicated than simply how much is my coin worth?”Mr. Huizenga then questioned whether customer funds from FTX.com were transferred to Alameda Research. In response, Ray said, “definitely, the assets of customers in the .com silo were transferred to Alameda, no question about it.”Ray then highlighted the concern currently being investigated: “whether or not there is comingling between the .com silo and the U.S. silo exchanges.”Huizenga turned then towards family involvement in the case, enquiring whether SBF’s father, Mr. Bankman received payment from FTX. Ray confirmed that “the family did receive payments.”Huizenga met with SBF on Dec. 8, 2021, accompanied by his father, Mr. Bankman. Noting that SBF was 15 minutes late to that meeting, Huizenga said:“I asked and focused on what types of regulation he was under his engagemnet with regulators and how that affected FTX but it seems that there’s a lot more to uncover here.”Next, Mr. Emmer discussed Gary Gensler with Ray, stating:“We know that Chair Gensler had more meetings with FTX than anyone else in the crypto industry.”Emmer said that what was being negotiated was a “framework for digital asset exchange registration and token registration with the SEC that would benefit both parties.Emmer detailed that this framework would “expand the SEC’s jurisdiction in exchange for the SEC’s preferential treatment of FTX over other industry participants.”Explaining that Chair Gensler has refused to answer committee questions or testify before the committee, Emmer questioned Ray whether he would share “any internal documents” regarding communication between FTX and Mr. Gensler or others of the SEC.Ray said:“We can certainly work with your staff to get you what you need.”Ray then confirmed to Mr. Steil that assets were moved out after the bankruptcy. Ray continued to reveal that funds were transferred after the petition date and were done both as a part of a hack and by the Bahamian authorities with the help of SBF.“It is our view that it violated the automated stay of bankruptcy.”Under questioning whether SBF was working to undermine the bankruptcy proceedings, Ray responded by saying, “it appears so.”“We have opened up to share everything we have with the Bahamian authorities.”Ray also stated that he had not seen a similar level of transparency from the Bahamas.OverviewWhile some new information was disclosed during the hearing, several House Committee members used their time to attack crypto, calling it “a garden of snakes” and “like counting chewing gum.”Much of the hearing ignored the relevance of FTX.US, the only entity regulated in the United States, with most customers being U.S. citizens. Instead, the conversation focused on FTX.com and Alameda Research, along with the potential 2% of FTX.com users who reside in the U.S.Members of the Committee showed a lack of understanding of blockchain as they failed to comprehend basic terminology such as “token minting,” with Mr. Vargas even declaring, “I don’t get the point of cryptocurrency, to begin with…other than if you’re a terrorist or someone that wants to hide money.” Mr. Cleaver even suggested that the industry should rebrand to “CreepyDoCurrency” instead of ‘cryptocurrency.’Ray, however, chose not the throw the crypto industry under the bus by dodging questions about whether crypto should be regulated by the SEC or CFTC.The current CEO often stated that he was unable to comment on specific matters related to totals of losses or the timeframe for customers to be able to make withdrawals. He also said that he was unsure whether FTX.US customers would receive 100% of the funds they deposited onto the U.S.-regulated exchange.Worryingly, Ray also revealed that he had not yet been able to find all the private keys for all the FTX wallets that have been identified but that his team is discovering new funds every day.Complete coverage of the hearing was live-streamed on CryptoSlate’s YouTube channel.Posted In: FTX, U.S., Bankruptcy, Featured, Investments, Legal  Author      Josh O'Sullivan      Editor/Reporter at CryptoSlateJosh has been writing for a decade and is passionate about mainstream crypto adoption, bringing positive financial change to the masses through crypto and decentralized finance as a whole.

The disgraced wunderkind, who stands accused of financial fraud on an international scale after his crypto exchange FTX lost billions of dollars in customers’ money, was arrested Monday night at the request of prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York. After a court hearing Tuesday in Nassau, Chief Magistrate Joyann Ferguson-Pratt ordered that Bankman-Fried be remanded due to his flight risk and due to the nature of the two nations’ extradition treaty. Bankman-Fried’s counsel argued that the flight risk could be mitigated by “electronic monitoring systems” and a large cash bail, according to Coindesk, though the judge was left unconvinced. The 30-year-old has been charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and campaign finance violations, according to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday.

Frank Opposition to utility “smart” meters (electric, gas, and water) has been ongoing worldwide since companies started deploying them.  Utilities encourage or force consumers to accept “smart” meters (see 1, 2) in order to remotely control and/or ration energy use (see 1, 2) as well as collect consumer usage data 24/7 to sell and/or share with 3rd parties.  In the U.K., “smart” meter complaints and problems continue to be publicized (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  At least one journalist recommends that consumers refuse them; however, ½ million of the poorest households are not being given that option.  Recently it was also reported that the government will now be collecting consumer usage data as well. From MSN via The Daily Mail:       Government to collect data from your smart meter: Fresh privacy row breaks out as energy companies share information on usage Story by Helena Kelly For The Daily Mail A privacy row has broken out over the energy bills support package after it emerged data from household meters is being shared with the Government. Ministers quietly announced in October it would begin collecting and processing personal information from people’s smart and traditional meters. Experts say it sets a ‘dangerous precedent’ and will affect smart meter customers more because their devices contain more sensitive data. When smart meters first arrived, some feared they would hold too much information on households as they track energy usage in real time. Experts warn this could leave homes vulnerable to burglars if they managed to hack the gadget and work out from readings when nobody was in. But customers were assured the data could only be viewed by their supplier. Video The introduction of the Energy Bills Support Scheme and Energy Price Guarantee means that information will now be shared with the Government. The first scheme gives customers £66 a month in winter to help with bills, while the guarantee, brought in by former prime minister Liz Truss, caps average energy bills at £2,500. Ministers want to use meter data to help identify fraudsters, such as those who claim energy bills support on an unused second property, for example. Shadow Energy Minister Alan Whitehead says: ‘This proposal is an outrageous piece of private data-plundering and goes against every assurance put in place concerning the privacy of data generated from smart meter use.     ‘It needs to be stopped immediately. There are many other ways to check on possible fraud in obtaining Energy Price Guarantee refunds.’ Nick Hunn, founder of consultancy firm WiFore, adds: ‘Customers were promised their smart meter data would only ever be shared with their supplier. For the Government to go back on this without a consultation sets a dangerous precedent.’ A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman says: ‘The Government will only retain data for as long as required to support the success of our energy bills support schemes, including minimising any risk of fraud. ‘Any data needed . . . will be processed fully in line with UK GDPR and the Data Access and Privacy Framework, which protects smart meter customers’ privacy. ‘Personal information such as names, addresses and bank details are never stored on a smart meter.’  Activist Post is Google-Free Support us for just $1 per month at Patreon or SubscribeStar Problems associated with “smart” meters include billing errors, cybersecurity risks, explosions, fires (see 1, 2, 3, 4), harmful radiation emissions, higher bills, installation mishaps, mechanical issues, and short lifespans.  Proponents insist that “smart” meters are essential for “energy efficiency” despite research that has proven otherwise (see 1, 2).  Documented issues have led to lawsuits (see 1, 2) and inspired a documentary film.

Whitehead and Nisha Whitehead  “He sees you when you’re sleeping He knows when you’re awake He knows when you’ve been bad or good So be good for goodness’ sake!” —“Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” You better watch out—you better not pout—you better not cry—I’m telling you why: this Christmas, it’s the Surveillance State that’s making a list and checking it twice, and it won’t matter whether you’ve been bad or good. You’ll be on this list whether you like it or not. Mass surveillance is the Deep State’s version of a “gift” that keeps on giving…back to the Deep State.      Geofencing dragnets. Fusion centers. Smart devices. Behavioral threat assessments. Terror watch lists. Facial recognition. Snitch tip lines. Biometric scanners. Pre-crime. DNA databases. Data mining. Precognitive technology. Contact tracing apps. What these add up to is a world in which, on any given day, the average person is now monitored, surveilled, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways by both government and corporate eyes and ears. Big Tech wedded to Big Government has become Big Brother. Every second of every day, the American people are being spied on by a vast network of digital Peeping Toms, electronic eavesdroppers and robotic snoops. This creepy new era of government/corporate spying—in which we’re being listened to, watched, tracked, followed, mapped, bought, sold and targeted—has been made possible by a global army of techno-tyrants, fusion centers and Peeping Toms. Consider just a small sampling of the tools being used to track our movements, monitor our spending, and sniff out all the ways in which our thoughts, actions and social circles might land us on the government’s naughty list, whether or not you’ve done anything wrong. Tracking you based on your phone and movements: Cell phones have become de facto snitches, offering up a steady stream of digital location data on users’ movements and travels. For instance, the FBI was able to use geofence data to identify more than 5,000 mobile devices (and their owners) in a 4-acre area around the Capitol on January 6. This latest surveillance tactic could land you in jail for being in the “wrong place and time.” Police are also using cell-site simulators to carry out mass surveillance of protests without the need for a warrant. Moreover, federal agents can now employ a number of hacking methods in order to gain access to your computer activities and “see” whatever you’re seeing on your monitor. Malicious hacking software can also be used to remotely activate cameras and microphones, offering another means of glimpsing into the personal business of a target. A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State Tracking you based on your DNA. DNA technology in the hands of government officials completes our transition to a Surveillance State. If you have the misfortune to leave your DNA traces anywhere a crime has been committed, you’ve already got a file somewhere in some state or federal database—albeit it may be a file without a name. By accessing your DNA, the government will soon know everything else about you that they don’t already know: your family chart, your ancestry, what you look like, your health history, your inclination to follow orders or chart your own course, etc. After all, a DNA print reveals everything about “who we are, where we come from, and who we will be.” It can also be used to predict the physical appearance of potential suspects. It’s only a matter of time before the police state’s pursuit of criminals expands into genetic profiling and a preemptive hunt for criminals of the future. Tracking you based on your face: Facial recognition software aims to create a society in which every individual who steps out into public is tracked and recorded as they go about their daily business. Coupled with surveillance cameras that blanket the country, facial recognition technology allows the government and its corporate partners to identify and track someone’s movements in real-time. One particularly controversial software program created by Clearview AI has been used by police, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to collect photos on social media sites for inclusion in a massive facial recognition database. Similarly, biometric software, which relies on one’s unique identifiers (fingerprints, irises, voice prints), is becoming the standard for navigating security lines, as well as bypassing digital locks and gaining access to phones, computers, office buildings, etc. In fact, greater numbers of travelers are opting into programs that rely on their biometrics in order to avoid long waits at airport security. Scientists are also developing lasers that can identify and surveil individuals based on their heartbeats, scent and microbiome. Tracking you based on your behavior: Rapid advances in behavioral surveillance are not only making it possible for individuals to be monitored and tracked based on their patterns of movement or behavior, including gait recognition (the way one walks), but have given rise to whole industries that revolve around predicting one’s behavior based on data and surveillance patterns and are also shaping the behaviors of whole populations. One smart “anti-riot” surveillance system purports to predict mass riots and unauthorized public events by using artificial intelligence to analyze social media, news sources, surveillance video feeds and public transportation data. Tracking you based on your spending and consumer activities: With every smartphone we buy, every GPS device we install, every Twitter, Facebook, and Google account we open, every frequent buyer card we use for purchases—whether at the grocer’s, the yogurt shop, the airlines or the department store—and every credit and debit card we use to pay for our transactions, we’re helping Corporate America build a dossier for its government counterparts on who we know, what we think, how we spend our money, and how we spend our time. Consumer surveillance, by which your activities and data in the physical and online realms are tracked and shared with advertisers, has become big business, a $300 billion industry that routinely harvests your data for profit. Corporations such as Target have not only been tracking and assessing the behavior of their customers, particularly their purchasing patterns, for years, but the retailer has also funded major surveillance in cities across the country and developed behavioral surveillance algorithms that can determine whether someone’s mannerisms might fit the profile of a thief.     Tracking you based on your public activities: Private corporations in conjunction with police agencies throughout the country have created a web of surveillance that encompasses all major cities in order to monitor large groups of people seamlessly, as in the case of protests and rallies. They are also engaging in extensive online surveillance, looking for any hints of “large public events, social unrest, gang communications, and criminally predicated individuals.” Defense contractors have been at the forefront of this lucrative market. Fusion centers, $330 million-a-year, information-sharing hubs for federal, state and law enforcement agencies, monitor and report such “suspicious” behavior as people buying pallets of bottled water, photographing government buildings, and applying for a pilot’s license as “suspicious activity.” Tracking you based on your social media activities: Every move you make, especially on social media, is monitored, mined for data, crunched, and tabulated in order to form a picture of who you are, what makes you tick, and how best to control you when and if it becomes necessary to bring you in line. As The Intercept reported, the FBI, CIA, NSA and other government agencies are increasingly investing in and relying on corporate surveillance technologies that can mine constitutionally protected speech on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in order to identify potential extremists and predict who might engage in future acts of anti-government behavior. This obsession with social media as a form of surveillance will have some frightening consequences in coming years. As Helen A.S. Popkin, writing for NBC News, observed, “We may very well face a future where algorithms bust people en masse for referencing illegal ‘Game of Thrones’ downloads… the new software has the potential to roll, Terminator-style, targeting every social media user with a shameful confession or questionable sense of humor.” Tracking you based on your social network: Not content to merely spy on individuals through their online activity, government agencies are now using surveillance technology to track one’s social network, the people you might connect with by phone, text message, email or through social message, in order to ferret out possible criminals. An FBI document obtained by Rolling Stone speaks to the ease with which agents are able to access address book data from Facebook’s WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage services from the accounts of targeted individuals and individuals not under investigation who might have a targeted individual within their network. What this creates is a “guilt by association” society in which we are all as guilty as the most culpable person in our address book. Tracking you based on your car: License plate readers are mass surveillance tools that can photograph over 1,800 license tag numbers per minute, take a picture of every passing license tag number and store the tag number and the date, time, and location of the picture in a searchable database, then share the data with law enforcement, fusion centers and private companies to track the movements of persons in their cars. With tens of thousands of these license plate readers now in operation throughout the country, affixed to overpasses, cop cars and throughout business sectors and residential neighborhoods, it allows police to track vehicles and run the plates through law enforcement databases for abducted children, stolen cars, missing people and wanted fugitives. Of course, the technology is not infallible: there have been numerous incidents in which police have mistakenly relied on license plate data to capture out suspects only to end up detaining innocent people at gunpoint. Tracking you based on your mail: Just about every branch of the government—from the Postal Service to the Treasury Department and every agency in between—now has its own surveillance sector, authorized to spy on the American people. For instance, the U.S. Postal Service, which has been photographing the exterior of every piece of paper mail for the past 20 years, is also spying on Americans’ texts, emails and social media posts. Headed up by the Postal Service’s law enforcement division, the Internet Covert Operations Program (iCOP) is reportedly using facial recognition technology, combined with fake online identities, to ferret out potential troublemakers with “inflammatory” posts. The agency claims the online surveillance, which falls outside its conventional job scope of processing and delivering paper mail, is necessary to help postal workers avoid “potentially volatile situations.” Now the government wants us to believe that we have nothing to fear from these mass spying programs as long as we’ve done nothing wrong. Don’t believe it. The government’s definition of a “bad” guy is extraordinarily broad, and it results in the warrantless surveillance of innocent, law-abiding Americans on a staggering scale.           As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, surveillance, digital stalking and the data mining of the American people—weapons of compliance and control in the government’s hands—haven’t made America any safer. And they certainly aren’t helping to preserve our freedoms. Indeed, America will never be safe as long as the U.S. government is allowed to shred the Constitution. ABOUT JOHN W.

It believes that electricity is too dangerous to use for lighting but can be utilized to make cheaper candles.Headline, 1989:The United States postal service will adopt a new technology called “the internet” to speed up the sorting and delivery of letters and postcards.Headline, 2022:The CEO of a major investment bank argues that blockchain, a technology invented to eliminate legacy intermediaries such as banks, is best used by those intermediaries to incrementally improve their outdated methods. That final headline is a summary of an op-ed authored by Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who argues that private blockchains deployed by regulated intermediaries are more useful than cryptocurrencies. This is the latest iteration of the “blockchain, not Bitcoin” argument we’ve heard for years. It usually starts with a list of why things like public blockchains or decentralized finance (DeFi) are dangerous and ends with the conclusion that only incumbents should be allowed to use the technology. But that’s not how history works.Every transformative technology starts out as “inefficient and dangerous.” The earliest automobiles often broke down, and one of the first major uses of electricity was executing prisoners. The people and companies who initially embrace new tech also tend to be suspect. Most car companies that popped up 100 years ago failed, and Thomas Edison used to electrocute animals to make his competitors look bad. But good tech that solves important problems wins anyway. To be fair, there was a time when I considered private blockchains to be a useful, though insignificant, solution — not as a substitute to crypto but as a temporary solution that could evolve in parallel. A bank, I would have told you three years ago, could use a private network to reduce internal inefficiencies today while learning how to interact with public ones tomorrow.But I was wrong. Despite a massive effort, the only thing private chains have achieved so far is impressive headlines followed by even more impressive failures. I can’t find a single instance of a corporate project doing something useful despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested in many. The list of epic failures grows by the week.Related: Learn from FTX and stop investing in speculationThe first problem with any private network is the bastardization of the point of crypto, which is to eliminate intermediaries like banks and the fees they collect. Take cross-border payments, where multiple correspondent banks have been (supposedly) building private blockchains to improve their internal transfers. The best correspondent bank isn’t a more efficient one — it’s the one you don’t need thanks to stablecoins.That’s not to say that banking will go away. Even stablecoins will need someone to hold their reserves, and tokens often need custodians. But the more time big banks waste on their private-chain fantasies, the less likely they are to build useful crypto products.In his op-ed, Solomon argues that “under the guidance of a regulated financial institution like ours, blockchain innovations can flourish,” followed by “the invention of email didn’t make FedEx or UPS obsolete.” This is a false analogy. A better one is the U.S. Postal Service, where mail volume collapsed by 50%. Is Wall Street listening?The second problem with any private network is the slow pace of development. In DeFi, new protocols are frequently launched by random developers. Most fail (sometimes catastrophically), but thanks to the permissionless nature of public networks, the iteration is instant. That’s how we get generational breakthroughs like Uniswap, built on a $100,000 grant — less money than the salary of the countless bank executives working on the latest private network fantasy.Related: From the NY Times to WaPo, the media is fawning over Bankman-Fried“But wait a minute,” bankers like to argue, “what about regulations? We can’t just dive head first into DeFi even if we wanted to.” That’s true. But it’s also their problem.What these executives are really saying is that they expect their regulatory moats to protect them indefinitely. If every DeFi project had to first get a banking license, then the pace of innovation in crypto would slow drastically.But that’s not how disruption works. By using smart contracts and cryptographically guaranteed outcomes, DeFi will be a lot safer than any bank. By riding a transparent, global public network like Ethereum, it will also be more accessible and fair than any financial system that we have today. Regulators will eventually come around.It’s hard to know exactly what a public permissionless future would look like, but the one thing we can be sure of is that it won’t look like how Wall Street operates today. That’s not how history works. Omid Malekan is a nine-year veteran of the crypto industry and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, where he lectures on blockchain and crypto.

Jim Himes (D-CT) argued that the failure to have appropriate regulation of companies like FTX isn’t due to FTX’s campaign contributions, it’s because “most” members of Congress “are still learning” about crypto and are “far from experts on finance, much less on next-generation finance or cryptocurrency.” Host Richard Quest asked, “Congressman, the allegation of dirty money flowing through, it laps…at the door of Congress, and all politicians at different levels. Does Congress need to look at itself and say, were we too easily duped by lobbyists’ money, which has subsequently [been] found to be less than clean?” Himes responded, “I don’t think that’s at play here. Now, there’s a whole other conversation to be had about the permeation of money in the U.S. political system. And yes, that’s a very, very good conversation. But look, a year ago, very few members of Congress had any idea what a crypto asset was and very few people around here today have particularly strong convictions. I think most people are still learning. Yes, you might have been visited by one of these companies or whatnot, but this is really technical stuff. And I’ve got to ask the question, just an hour ago, if Sam Bankman-Fried had come and testified in front of your committee, would people have been easy on him because he gave somebody $2,900 in campaign contributions? The answer to that is absolutely not. Now, I do want to have that other conversation about campaign finance reform, but in this particular instance, this is more a question of it being an immensely technical and esoteric topic with members of Congress being far from experts on finance, much less on next-generation finance or cryptocurrency.”   Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett ",2022-12-13

According to a series of tweets Coinbase shared with its users, the airdrop will be distributed to XRP holders in “supported jurisdictions.” The exchange clarified that it cannot guarantee support for any particular jurisdiction and that FLR trading is “expected to generally be available in Coinbase’s supported jurisdiction.”  Coinbase intends to honor our prior commitment to our customers to support @FlareNetworks’ FLR airdrop.— Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) December 12, 2022  FLR trading is notably not going to be available in several jurisdictions including Germany, Japan, New York, and Singapore. Coinbase is joining a number of other exchanges supporting the airdrop, including Crypto.com. The airdrop is set to distribute $FLR tokens to each user holding XRP at the time of the snapshot at a 1:1 ratio. As CryptoGlobe reported, back in August Japanese cryptocurrency trading platform Huobi Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of popular trading platform Huobi, announced support for the airdrop. Flare network is a blockchain bringing smart contract functionalities to XRP and other cryptoassets that do not yet have them, although it’s bringing these in through a separate blockchain than the XRP Ledger.             Spark tokens are to be used for governance on the Flare network through voting mechanisms, and token holders will be able to earn a return on their holdings by committing Spark tokens as collateral to secure the trustless issuance and redemption of FXRP, a protocol built to “safely enable the trustless issuance, usage, and redemption, of XRP on Flare.” Earlier this year, Flare Networks entered a new partnership with Ola finance, a platform offering customized lending networks, in a bid to further expand the decentralized finance (DeFi) offering it brings to assets like $XRP and Dogecoin ($DOGE). Notably Coinbase was one of the cryptocurrency exchanges that delisted $XRP after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and two of its executives alleging they sold unregistered securities when they issued $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens. Ripple denies XRP is a security. Earlier this month Coinbase said its self-custody crypto wallet app Coinbase Wallet would be dropping support for four major cryptoassets, including XRP, from January 2023 over “low usage.” Image Credit Featured Image via Unsplash ",2022-12-13

The bank’s research note comes at a time when the entirety of the crypto market is facing adversity and the price of bitcoin is down more than 70% from its all-time high price at current levels. According to Goldman Sachs, gold actually presents the opportunity that investors seem to be looking for in bitcoin. Gold Is A Better Inflation Hedge In the research note, Goldman Sachs says it expects gold to perform better than bitcoin in the long run given its already established use cases. For one, gold remains a hedge against inflation and dollar debasement, as well as being a better portfolio diversifier compared to bitcoin. Related Reading: Why The GBTC Discount Could Lead To A Bitcoin Sell-Off Additionally, Goldman Sachs explained that gold is not as affected by tighter liquidity as BTC. Since there is more demand for gold, it tends to do better in situations such as these whereas digital assets such as bitcoin tend to succumb to such liquidity crunches.                   var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607465 = window.pid607465 || rnd;             var plc607465 = window.plc607465 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607465;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607465+';place='+(plc607465++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                     if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.async = true; s.type = ""text/javascript"";s.src = ""https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js"";var n = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}               var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];             var abkw = window.abkw || """";             var plc366606 = window.plc366606 || 0;             (function(){             var divs = document.querySelectorAll("".plc366606:not([id])"");             var div = divs[divs.length-1];             div.id = ""placement_366606_""+plc366606;             AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 366606, [728,90], ""placement_366606_""+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc366606++, keywords: abkw, domain: ""servedbyadbutler.com"", click:""CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER"" }});             })();                                  var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);             var pid607472 = window.pid607472 || rnd;             var plc607472 = window.plc607472 || 0;             var abkw = window.abkw || '';             var absrc = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=607472;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid607472+';place='+(plc607472++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';             document.write('');                  The research note also compares bitcoin to a “risk-on high-growth tech company stock.” As well as the digital asset’s value is based on future use cases instead of established use cases like in the case of gold. It explained that since bitcoin is “a solution looking for a problem,” it is more prone to volatility and is a more speculative asset compared to gold.  BTC trending at $17,400 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Can Bitcoin Close The Gap? Bitcoin is often referred to as the ‘digital gold’ due to its performance over the years. It has been utilized as an inflation hedge by many at various stages, but the bull and bear cycles can see BTC fall short as a hedge during times such as these.

We have seen this before. Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits. Business as usual for us. I actually think it is a good idea to ‘stress test withdrawals’ on each CEX (centralized exchange) on a rotating basis. It costs some network fees to run these ‘tests’. But keeps the industry healthy. Exchange business is simple.” Following the collapse of FTX, crypto exchanges have seen increased scrutiny over the transparency of their finances, prompting many to provide proof-of-reserves reports, including Binance. The reports haven’t satisfied everybody, and some, including Kraken founder Jesse Powell have spoken out to criticize the reliability of them. Powell said he wasn’t trying to spread fear or rumors, but did see some potential red flags in Binance’s latest report. “Big red flag for me is that this seems to be more of an attempt at proving collateral rather than proving reserves. They even admit to [being] insolvent with regard to actual assets owed vs tokens controlled. The ‘collateral’ accounting trick is exactly how FTX played solvent as well.” According to a recent review from Mazars, Binance has more than enough reserves to back its users’ Bitcoin (BTC), and all withdrawals from the exchange are so far being processed smoothly.

The complaint made public today by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has some hair-raising details — and if it’s right, Sam Bankman-Fried hasn’t been telling the truth for quite some time. According to the complaint, Bankman-Fried operated Alameda Research and FTX as a common enterprise, for instance. This complaint is civil.In a press conference today, US attorney Damian Williams characterized Alameda Research and FTX as “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.”Sam Bankman-Fried was deeply involved with Alameda ResearchSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud “from the start,” the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges — with a “multi-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.”Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.Bankman-Fried said that he “didn’t know exactly what was going on” at Alameda Research and that he “wasn’t running Alameda.” According to the CFTC complaint, that’s not even a little true. It says that Bankman-Fried was a signatory on Alameda’s bank accounts, and was an “authorized trader for Alameda’s accounts with CFTC futures commissions merchants.” He also had direct authority “over all of Alameda’s major trading, investment, and financial decisions.” He made calls in person and over “mobile chat communications” with senior Alameda personnel.From May 2019 through November 11th, 2022, FTX customer deposits — including both fiat currency and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum — were regularly held by “and / or appropriated” by Alameda for its own use, the complaint alleges. Only a small circle of insiders knew that. Alameda traders could tap an “essentially unlimited” line of credit on FTX, and there were special exceptions to FTX’s usual processes that gave Alameda faster execution times than everyone else.Still, Bankman-Fried wanted the world to think there was a strong separation between the two entities, the complaint says. That was a major motivator for his resignation as the CEO of Alameda.But wait! There’s more! When FTX was on the verge of collapse, Alameda Research’s traders were instructed to sell everything, fast, and “generally do anything possible to quickly obtain billions of dollars in capital to send to FTX,” the CFTC complaint says. When a trader summarized this directive to him, Bankman-Fried confirmed it. He also said “‘there is definitely a fair bit of urgency’ and asked for the ‘ETA on getting at least $2b of USD,”” according to the complaint.When FTX executives found a shortfall in FTX US, according to the complaint, Bankman-Fried said he would fill the hole using Alameda Research’s assets, and on November 8th, “Bankman-Fried directed Alameda traders to prioritize meeting FTX US capital requirements and to send excess capital to FTX US.” Alameda sent more than $185 million to cover the shortfall, the complaint says.Alameda and FTX were intertwined on a software — and hardware — levelAlthough Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison previously stated that she and Bankman-Fried keep the two companies “quite separate in terms of day-to-day operations,” the CFTC makes a pretty strong argument indicating that this, too, could be false.Bankman-Fried and other senior managers at both Alameda and FTX are accused of having “widespread access to each other’s systems and accounts.” Both teams shared office spaces, as well as “key personnel, technology and hardware, intellectual property, and other resources,” according to the complaint.FTX and Alameda commingled and traded customer fundsIn an interview at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit, Bankman-Fried said, “I didn’t knowingly commingle funds” between FTX and Alameda. The government thinks otherwise.When Bankman-Fried launched FTX, customers who wanted to send fiat currency to their FTX accounts were told to wire their money to Alameda Research. Those funds weren’t kept separate from Alameda’s money, or placed into accounts labeled “for the benefit of” FTX customers, the complaint says. The Alameda accounts that held FTX money were labeled “fiat@ftx” on FTX’s internal ledger system.The agency also alleged a longtime pattern of Alameda and FTX sharing funds. “Alameda accessed and used FTX customer funds for Alameda’s own operations and activities, including to fund its trading, investment, and borrowing / lending activities,” the complaint says.Alameda isn’t just accused of using money sent to its own bank accounts. According to the SEC, it had the ability to make unlimited withdrawals from its FTX trading account and could tap digital assets there, too.Bankman-Fried (and his parents) used customer funds for private jets and a bunch of other stuffThe CFTC claims that Bankman-Fried, his parents, and his employees at FTX and Alameda used customers' funds for personal benefit: luxury real estate, private jets, personal loans, and political donations. The customer funds were also used for a Super Bowl commercial starring Larry David and the sponsorship of FTX Arena in Miami. These advertisements, which the CFTC says were paid for by customers’ funds, said that FTX was “the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.”FTX’s terms of service were liesFTX’s terms of service said that none of the digital assets in a user’s account “shall or may be loaned to FTX Trading.” According to the CFTC complaint, that was a lie. The use of customer funds wasn’t authorized by FTX customers, and they didn’t know their funds were being used by Alameda Research, the complaint says.The CFTC’s complaint also indicates that Bankman-Fried may have lied to Congress about FTX’s terms of service during his appearance on February 9th, 2022. At the time, Bankman-Fried told US lawmakers, “As a general principle, FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms.”Bankman-Fried made “tens of millions” of dollars worth of political donations with customer funds, authorities sayBankman-Fried’s reputation as a liberal do-gooder was largely founded on his generous donations made to Democrats and progressive groups. But in its indictment published Tuesday, the Southern District Court of New York accused SBF of violating multiple campaign finance laws over his last three years at FTX. Specifically, US attorney Damian Williams said in a Tuesday press conference that SBF’s “contributions were disguised to look like they were coming from wealthy co-conspirators when in fact the contributions were funded by Alameda Research’s stolen customer money.” ",2022-12-13

Worry not. If you're hearing these words for the first time or are simply in need of a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean... Bitcoin Bitcoin is a type of digital currency (cryptocurrency). Similar to traditional currencies, like the dollar, pound or euro, there are many types of digital currencies. Other popular ones include Ethereum and Dogecoin. Unlike traditional currencies, though, Bitcoin is not backed or controlled by centralised financial institutions. Instead, it is decentralised. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile - rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers.Blockchain Blockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many other products like NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens). All of the buying, selling and trading of cryptocurrencies is recorded onto this virtual spreadsheet, which is arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain. Every cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. Since the blockchain is decentralised, it's not stored on one machine or network or owned by one company. The information is accessible to everyone.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Are crypto-currencies the future of money?Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency is the term used for digital currencies like Bitcoin that exist on the blockchain. Crypto Exchange A crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, from their banks into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees.Crypto WalletA crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. It stores the virtual assets much like a traditional wallet holds cash. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USBs that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage.Related TopicsCryptocurrencyMore on this storyWhat is Bitcoin?

An extradition hearing is scheduled for February 8th.Bankman-Fried, nicknamed “SBF,” was arrested in the Bahamas Monday evening after US prosecutors informed the Bahamas of sweeping criminal charges expected to be filed against the disgraced crypto darling. In an unsealed indictment Tuesday, prosecutors at the Justice Department’s Southern District of New York charged Bankman-Fried with eight counts of fraud, including lying to investors and violating US campaign finance law.Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud “from the start,” the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges — with a “multi-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.”Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.Earlier on Tuesday, Bankman-Fried appeared before a Bahamas court in his first public appearance since FTX’s November collapse. SBF’s lawyers sought his release on $250,000 in bail. The court’s decision to deny bail follows a marathon hearing in the House Financial Services Committee where lawmakers questioned current FTX CEO John J. Ray III over the exchange’s collapse. Before his arrest on Monday, SBF was slated to testify before lawmakers as well. In remarks obtained by The Wall Street Journal, SBF was prepared to apologize for the implosion, but also placed partial blame onto Ray and rival cryptocurrency exchange Binance. “I would like to start by formally stating, under oath: I fucked up,” the remarks said.Throughout Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers broadly agreed FTX’s collapse warranted greater regulation of the crypto regulation. But with little time left before the end of the year, McHenry said the committee would pick up negotiations in January. “The arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried is welcome news, but it still does not get to the bottom of what happened at FTX, and why it happened, and who else may be responsible,” incoming Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-TX) said in his opening statement.",2022-12-13

Federal prosecutors allege Bankman-Fried also violated multiple campaign finance laws by making secret political donations, and using customer funds in some of those cases.In a complaint filed by the SEC, the 30 year-old allegedly diverted customer assets maintained by his company FTX, into his separate crypto hedge fund Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried then used customer funds to make “undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.”“Bankman-Fried raised more than $1.8 billion from investors, including US investors, who bought an equity stake in FTX believing that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures,” the complaint reads.“Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire,” the complaint continues.Revelation surrounding the newly unsealed indictment come after watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint that alleged Bankman-Fried had earlier admitted to making contributions to both Democrats and Republicans. It was also outlined donations made to Republicans would likely make him “the second or third largest Republican donor.”Another criminal indictment against Bankman-Fried alleged he and others violated multiple federal campaign finance laws by donating to political action committees under different names in the amount of, at least, $25,000. The complaint brought by CREW alleges Bankman-Fried directed about $37 million, and maybe more “to influence federal elections while evading federal laws that require disclosure of the true source of contributions.”AnalysisBankman-Fried Arrest: FTX Founder May Know Whether Foreign Money Flew Into US Politics, Analyst Says13 December 2022, 18:57 GMTMark Cohen, an attorney representing Bankman-Fried, has said that Bankman-Fried is presently ""reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.""Bankman-Fried was denied bail on Tuesday by a magistrate judge in the Bahamas, who cited the FTX figure as a potential flight risk.

During Bankman-Fried’s first court appearance since his arrest on Monday, Chief Magistrate Joyann Ferguson-Pratt said that the FTX co-founder posed too big of a flight risk to be released. An attorney for the FTX co-founder had proposed that his client pay $250,000 cash bail and wear an ankle bracelet to be allowed to leave his cell.  “Risk of flight is so great that Samuel Bankman-Fried ought to be remanded in custody,” Chief Magistrate Joyann Ferguson-Pratt said. “I am not satisfied that there is any condition that I could place in Samuel Bankman-Fried to sufficiently satisfy, because of his access to substantial finances, that he would not and could not abscond.” An extradition hearing for Bankman-Fried was set for Feb. 8. Earlier in the arraignment proceedings on Tuesday, his lawyer said that he would fight plans to send him to the US to face charges.  Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts, including conspiracy and wire fraud, for allegedly misusing billions of dollars in customers’ funds before last month’s spectacular collapse of his cryptocurrency empire. Dressed in a blue suit and white shirt for the arraignment proceedings, Bankman-Fried at times appeared shaky and fidgety. His parents were present in the courtroom as their 30-year-old son was frequently referred to as a “fugitive.” After the judge announced that his bail would be denied his mom, visibly upset, hugged him with teary eyes. Bankman-Fried was allowed 15 minutes with his parents before he was to be taken to prison. Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter examines how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today's executives.

According to The Guardian – which ironically has one of the worst records when it comes to pro-establishment / anti-Assange reporting – “the biggest test of Biden’s commitment remains imprisoned in a jail cell in London, where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been held since 2019 while facing prosecution in the United States under the Espionage Act.”      Assange notably exposed US war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan and the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, which included 400,000 field reports about the Iraq War; 15,000 unreported deaths of Iraqi civilians; and systematic rape, torture and murder committed by Iraqi forces after the U.S. military “handed over detainees to a notorious Iraqi torture squad,” according to TruthOut. WikiLeaks also disclosed the Afghan War Logs, which are 90,000 reports of more civilian casualties by coalition forces than the U.S. military had admitted to. And its revelations additionally included the Guantánamo Files, 779 secret reports showing that 150 innocent people had been held there for years and documenting the torture and abuse of 800 men and boys in violation of the Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  And while former President Barack Obama commuted the sentence to leaker Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, Assange has been left to rot in prison as he awaits extradition to the United States to stand trial under the Espionage Act. Now, Biden is facing a push from both inside the US and internationally, to drop charges against Assange that were levied against him by the Trump DOJ in 2019 – when UK authorities arrested the WikiLeaks foundre and dragged him out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London. As he was pulled from the building, Assange yelled “This is unlawful, I am not leaving.” The Trial of Julian Assange: A Story of Persecution by Nils Melzer But the Biden administration immediately continued pursuing Assange. Within two weeks of his 2021 inauguration, the Biden DOJ repeatedly asked the UK courts to renew America’s request for Assange’s extradition – which was eventually approved by then-home secretary Priti Patel in June. Assange is appealing the decision, arguing that he is “being prosecuted and punished for his political opinions.”  Almost all of the 18 charges brought against Assange in the 2019 indictment center on the actual publication online of secret military and government material by WikiLeaks, much of it garnered from former US military whistleblower Chelsea Manning. Only one of the charges accuses Assange of actively working to help Manning secure the classified information. In that instance, prosecutors charged that Assange offered to help Manning to crack the password for one classified military system – an attempt that failed. -The Guardian  In late November, five major media outlets sent a letter to the Biden administration, including the NY Times and The Guardian, calling for the US government to end its prosecution of Assange.  Monday 28th Nov is the 12th anniversary of the beginning of the momentous #Cablegate publication     Nine days later its publisher Julian Assange was arrested and has been in detention ever since – facing a 175 year sentence if extradited for truthful reporting #FreeAssangeNOW pic.twitter.com/AeQdN94YXS — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 27, 2022  “This case is hugely significant,” said Columbia University law professor Jameel Jaffer, who runs the Knight First Amendment Institute at the university. “At the end of the day, I find it hard to believe that the Biden administration wants this case to be its press freedom legacy, and it will be its legacy if they continue to pursue it. That will overshadow everything else when it comes to press freedom.”  Justice department officials aren’t tipping their hand about where Assange’s prosecution might eventually lead, as he continues to challenge his extradition to the US before a British appeals court. The justice department declined to comment on all the outside calls to drop the case, but one official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Garland “has made clear that he will follow the law wherever it leads”, as he has in other politically charged cases. For all the outside pressure on the justice department to drop the case, a critical factor could turn out to be the internal regulations that Garland announced in October banning the use of records seizures and other investigative steps against “news media acting within the scope of news gathering” except in what the department said would be limited circumstances. -The Guardian            A central argument by the West has been whether Assange should be considered a journalist – which would entitle him to First Amendment protections in the US, or a ‘rogue operative,’ who GOP Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska once called “an outlet for foreign propaganda and … an enemy of the American people.” According to Barry J Pollack, Assange’s lead lawyer in the US, “the new regulations certainly cry out for someone at the highest levels of the justice department to take a fresh look at this prosecution to see whether it is really consistent with the new policy,” and to determine “is this the type of case we want to be pursuing?” “The timing is ripe for that,” he continued.

Can this help to sustain naira value for long? It really shouldn’t be the CBN’s role to be supplying banks with foreign exchange, at best, it should concern itself with forex needs of the government. The Central Bank of Nigeria can intervene in the economy by supplying banks with foreign exchange to help stabilize the value of the naira for a short period. However, this intervention alone may not be enough to sustain the value of the naira over the long term. The government would likely need to implement a broader range of economic policies (export expansion policies) to support the naira and help to promote sustainable economic growth. What matters isn’t how many Naira exchange for a dollar. Rather, there should be relative stability. Should the naira be devalued or the parallel market continue to allow it to operate with the official rate of the naira?  A parallel market exists for two reasons: The official market isn’t meeting all legitimate forex needs on a timely basis. People can also sell remittances at a much higher rate than the official market offers. It is normal human nature to pursue the part of the best profit. Once you fix this and part of the solution is a devaluation, you will have less demand at the parallel market. Allowing the parallel market to continue operating with an official rate for the naira could potentially lead to a situation where the official rate and the parallel market rate for the naira become misaligned, which could create confusion and uncertainty in the economy. Devaluing the naira, on the other hand, could help to align the official rate with the market rate and help to reduce the gap between the two. However, devaluing the naira could also have negative consequences, such as making imported goods more expensive and potentially leading to higher inflation. We must also take enforcement seriously. We simply shouldn’t have people hawking forex like soft drinks. Fixing demand should solve that in addition to law enforcement.       We also should bring back BDCs. This time they should source their own forex and strictly meet all KYC rules. I don’t see why for relatively small needs say between $100 to $5, 000 people are going to the bank. BDCs can solve that. As a professional in the personal finance space, what major challenges exist for most Nigerians in taking charge of their finance? Personal finance is in the best interest of everyone. Also, people want to see an immediate impact. It’s like going to the gym. It is a long-term play. So, the biggest challenge is that people want immediate results. Another question we get is, how can I invest so I can get N500, 000 every month? And If you ask them how much they want to invest? They usually have just N1m to N3m, and I do not mean this in a disrespectful way. So what you’re asking for is a miracle. Only a Ponzi scheme can give them the kind of return with the kind of capital they have. So, how do you educate people and be like, contrary to what everybody hears, building wealth is a long-term play? Not everyone can live for three months without a job. So, this passive income we all fantasize about, many of us are not there yet.  Even though I am not there yet. I cannot afford to quit. Now I have to keep working; it is a  truth that many people are not ready to face. They don’t want to accept it, and that’s where the problem is. So, in summary, the return that individuals desire is higher than what is reasonable; in one way or another, bad experiences, such as the stock market, also influence them. The bulk of work lies in changing the human perspective on saving and investment.         What options exist in the financial market for young people to invest in financial freedom? The first option that exists is education. If you jump into it without educating yourself, you will be back where you are. It’s like building a house, the foundation is not good, and then the building collapses; of course, we don’t want that. First, we want them to build a solid foundation with the right education. Now once you’ve gotten the right education, right, we want to start inculcating good habits; people are waiting to blow. Start with the N5, 000 every month and N10, 000 every month. What it’s doing is teaching you the discipline so that when the bigger money comes, you can channel it well. So, do not wait until you blow before learning how to manage money. Thirdly, everyone has to start from somewhere. You have to take action. First, you draw up that budget plan; how much is coming in? How much is going out? Are there any leakages that I can block? Then we block the leakages; imagine working so hard, but there is leakage letting all your effort be in vain?  Four, we need a long-term outlook.  Related News   Naira slumps further, exchanges 1,190/$  Sustainable solutions to current forex challenges  Naira under pressure, Nigeria may seek dollar loan –IMF    So the long-term outlook is very important if you want to play a long-term game. You are especially doing it so that you can pass generational wealth to our children. Propagating the message of financial literacy has been a struggle seeing that a 2015 Nigerian financial survey said 31.1 per cent of financial illiteracy exists in urban areas while 68.5 per cent abound in rural areas. What methods can be employed to bring this learning to the grass root?       For companies like mine, I see many of us doing it as a CSR. Now the thing about CSR is this. CSR means that you do not plan to monetize. It’s a one-off thing. And it’s not consistent. What you do not put a lot of expectation into, it’s hard for you to be able to track it. Now when people do that, play. That is, they’re going to rural areas. They already see what they can monetize. For instance, if you look at microfinance loans, they have deep penetrations there; LAPO and the rest of them know how the market works and can get their money back. Meanwhile, if you are thinking, I want to educate them, many people might not want to go that route because they can’t see how they can’t see a path to monetisation. In summary, how can we get to these areas? By playing the long-term card, where we don’t treat it like a CSR where we’re intentional, right? Even though we cannot monetize it today, those people might have the resources to pay for that service. The next three years, next five years, we play the long-term games and still do the education, or those currently offering them services that they are monetizing should then offer them that education because they are already monetizing in one way or the other. According to a Next Gen 2022, there’s no finance report in the US 22.7 per cent of high school students have access to courses on personal finance. So do you think these models should be emulated in Nigeria? Absolutely, and that is why we are also building our company’s kid service. Every time we teach adults about money, they end up spending their 20s and sometimes early 30s trying to figure it out, but if we get to the children early to play a long-term game, catch them in schools, catch them in primary and secondary schools, look for how to inculcate it into the system. We’re helping build adults now be able to manage their money better; then again, it is a long-term plan and is very important. In a bid to salvage finance, Nigeria has become a hotspot for Cryptocurrency trading. From a personal finance perspective, is this a sustainable venture? It depends. We must remember that cryptocurrency is a high-risk asset, and there is no regulation. So if it goes haywire,, we see that the impact is high. It is more advisable for people that have a safety net.   So imagine me not having any form of safety there, meaning that if I were to lose my job now if anything was to happen, I would be back on the street. This means  I have no business participating because of the risky nature of it. Could you look at FTX? Everything looked like it was okay, well funded, amongst others. Yet, people lost billions of dollars. So it’s a high-risk asset. I see why people embrace it because you can earn interest in dollars. You can use it to preserve your money and fight inflation. But other ways minimize that risk. So here’s my take. Am I saying no to cryptocurrency? No, I am not. It’s a luxury kind of investment in the sense that it is for those that have safety nets, for even those that have safety nets. They’re measuring the size of their portfolio, usually, something like five per cent or thereabout because of the high-risk nature of it that if they lose it, what’s going to happen? And everybody must always bear that in mind. What happens if I lose it? Ponzi schemes and fraud have increased, with more individuals falling prey. Is any of this tied to poor knowledge of financial systems? It is a 50/50 situation. Some people walk into it without knowledge of the alternate options that exist. We need to start showing people the options. What are they looking for? Looking for higher interest rates? Some options will not give you that unrealistic amount. For example, sometimes they promise them as high as 30 per cent monthly. That is unreasonable. Because it is about 360 per cent a year, who can afford to give anyone that? So we should start educating people about options for long-term play. People want good returns so show them the options. So, even if they are taking risks, it’s not an outright Ponzi. Is it risky? Yes, but there could be high returns there. The important lesson here is to paint the picture that building wealth is a long-term journey eventually, you will get there, but not as fast as the other options will give.       ",2022-12-13

According to the flow chart, Bankman-Fried held a roughly 53% stake in this silo; Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, former FTX executives, held roughly 17% and 8%, respectively; and third-party investors held just over 22%.The WRS / FTX US silo contains LedgerX, a crypto trading platform regulated by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that FTX acquired and rebranded as FTX Derivatives; securities broker-dealer FTX Capital Markets; Embed Clearing, a broker clearinghouse; FTX Gaming; and FTX NFTs.It also includes loans made to BlockFi, a crypto lender that received investment from FTX and also lent money to Alameda prior to entering bankruptcy amid the broader contagion in crypto markets caused by FTX's failure.BLOCKFI'S BANKRUPTCY EXIT PLANAlameda Research     Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison via Twitter (Twitter @carolinecapital)WHO IS CAROLINE ELLISON AND HOW DID SHE END UP AT CENTER OF FTX COLLAPSE?Alameda is a hedge fund that specialized in trading within the crypto space. It was co-founded by Bankman-Fried and Tara Mac Aulay. Mac Aulay tweeted that she and ""a group of others"" all quit in 2018, in part due to concerns over risk management and business ethics. Bankman-Fried held a 90% stake in the firm, which was led by Caroline Ellison prior to its collapse. Reports say Alameda improperly received billions of dollars in FTX customers' funds and leveraged those funds to make risky investments that didn't pan out and led to the failure of both the hedge fund and FTX when the firms were unable to repay their lenders. Notably, BlockFi filed a lawsuit against a holding company associated with Bankman-Fried that defaulted on a promise to repay Alameda's debts with shares in Robinhood Markets before the firms entered bankruptcy.The Alameda silo contained cryptocurrencies, crypto ETFs, other digital assets, and treasuries. Alameda also made a number of venture investments of its own into crypto miner Genesis Digital Assets; Modulo Capital; Pionic (Toss); and others.Venture Investments     Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during an interview on an episode of Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug 17, 2022.

Alameda is said to have improperly siphoned $8 billion from customers of the now-bankrupt FTX.In its own suit, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Alameda enjoyed special access to FTX’s trading backend. It could execute trades faster than other customers and was exempt from auto-liquidation, both “unfair advantages,” the suit said. And it could borrow as much money as it liked.Alameda Research was the giant crypto hedge fund and market making firm that Sam Bankman-Fried launched in 2017, well before FTX. It started as a bitcoin arbitrage trader but quickly grew into one of the industry's most influential names, both for its perceived trading prowess and its billions of dollars in capital. Alameda's stature rose in tandem with FTX's; Bankman-Fried ran both until October 2021, when he declared he was leaving the fund.Publicly, the firms claimed to be two different companies that operated ""at an arm's length,"" Alameda's former CEO Caroline Ellison has previously said. But in reality Bankman-Fried ran FTX and Alameda in lockstep, the suits allege. And Alameda was playing with FTX customers' funds.Bankman-Fried, who owns 90% of Alameda, was arrested in the Bahamas Monday and faces criminal money laundering, conspiracy and fraud charges in the U.S. His stunning fall from CEO at the top of the crypto industry to international defendant took just over one month.In that time, the 30-year-old former billionaire had embarked on an aggressive apology tour to cast his role in FTX’s implosion as stupid and reckless but hardly criminal. At times he jumped around questions that probed Alameda’s relationship with FTX and has repeatedly denied knowing of any back doors.Hardcoded loopholesThe new suits take direct aim at Bankman-Fried’s assertions. He “directed” FTX to let Alameda do things its other customers could not, such as fall below margin requirements on risky bets and execute trades when its accounts were empty, the suits allege. They went on to say these loopholes were baked into FTX’s code at Bankman-Fried’s direction.When institutional customers like Alameda placed trades on FTX they used an API, which is by design more streamlined – and thus faster – than the website retail traders use. But Alameda’s access was faster still. According to the CFTC, it “was able to bypass certain portions” of the FTX API to move “several milliseconds faster” than other big spenders.Part of Alameda’s speed boost was due to its other special privileges. Because it didn’t need to have enough money to place trades, it wholly sidestepped the automatic balance check that other accounts had to clear. This gave Alameda “another significant speed advantage.”Once, when Alameda maxed out its borrowing limit on FTX, Bankman-Fried told staffers to set a ceiling so high it would never be reached, the CFTC alleged. Alameda could theoretically withdraw tens of billions of dollars from FTX.Alameda’s infinite money glitch led to the hedge fund repaying “billions of dollars of loans” using customer deposits, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. It unsealed criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried Tuesday after the former FTX CEO’s arrest in the Bahamas.Bankman-Fried tried to hide the relationship between his “personal piggy bank” and FTX by routing money to seemingly unaffiliated bank accounts that Alameda controlled, according to the SEC. FTX used the unassuming account name “fiat@ftx.com” to track its sister company’s multi-billion-dollar debts without raising eyebrows. And Alameda never told third parties that its “loan” was from FTX.Even when FTX tried to untangle its liabilities in 2022 it gave special treatment to Alameda. Bankman-Fried stopped the exchange’s accounting systems from charging interest on the hedge fund’s $8 billion liability (it had done so automatically, per the SEC).'We can’t really shut it down.'Bankman-Fried “drafted and shared a document that questioned whether Alameda should be permanently shut down” in September 2022, months before it imploded, according to the CFTC.His reasoning: Alameda was taking on more risk than it was worth.“I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down. Honestly, it was probably time to do that a year ago,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a document titled “We came, we saw, we researched.”At the same time, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that Alameda played such a large role in FTX’s operations that it might be impossible to pull the plug. As FTX's primary market maker, ensured trades went smoothly for all FTX customers, not just itself. Disappearing Alameda would create a shortfall in liquidity that might undermine FTX's value as an exchange.“Given the amount that Alameda is doing, we can’t really shut it down,” he wrote, according to the CFTC.The fallThe SEC and CFTC chart Nov. 2 as the day Alameda and FTX began to unravel. On that day, the regulators said CoinDesk published an article that probed Alameda’s extensive FTT token holdings. FTT is a token issued by FTX, and Alameda had billions of dollars of FTT and other FTX-linked tokens on its balance sheet.“On November 6, 2022, in response to this article, the CEO of [rival exchange] Binance tweeted that, “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came (sic) to light,” he would be selling the remainder of his significant FTT holdings, which he acquired during the buyout from FTX seed investment,” the CFTC said, referring to CEO Changpeng Zhao.Binance’s call-to-liquidate tanked the price of FTT and triggered a run on deposits at FTX. One day later, it became clear to the exchange that it didn’t have enough cash to cover for customers, the CFTC said.At the same time, Alameda traders were directed to “sell everything that could be sold” in a mad dash to “generally do anything possible to quickly obtain billions of dollars in capital to send to FTX,” the CFTC said, noting Bankman-Fried played a key role in that effort.Bankman-Fried also planned to use Alameda’s fire sale to fill a hole at FTX US, which was also getting pummeled by withdrawals. Executives there had found “a shortfall they did not understand and were unable to quantify,” per the CFTC. (During his apology tour Bankman-Fried insisted that the U.S. exchange was never insolvent.)“On November 8, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda traders to prioritize meeting FTX US capital requirements and to send excess capital to FTX US. On information and belief, Alameda sent in excess of $185 million to FTX US to fill its shortfall,” the CFTC said.It was just one more criss-cross in the sprawling, unspoken ties between Alameda and all aspects of the FTX empire.",2022-12-13

SBF, as he is often called, has been on a media tour since FTX’s failure, and he portrays himself as a well-intentioned doofus savant who got in way over his head and—whoops—lost billions of dollars.

In a research note, the bank wrote that gold is a “useful portfolio diversifier” as it has developed non-speculative use cases, while $BTC is, in their view, still looking for one. Goldman’s analysts, according to Reuters, showed that while traders use gold to hedge against inflation and dollar debasement, BTC resembles a “risk-on high-growth tech company stock.” According to the bank, the cryptocurrency is a “solution looking for a problem,” whose value proposition comes from its future real use cases. For now it’s more volatile and speculative than the precious metal. The bank forecast that as financial conditions become tighter, investors’ willingness to explore decentralized digital currencies may erode. Referring to hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, lenders BlockFi and Celsius, and FTX, the bank wrote: Bitcoin’s volatility to the downside was also enhanced by systemic concerns as several large players filed for bankruptcy             According to Goldman Sachs, the net speculative positions in both gold and bitcoin have fallen significantly over the last year. However, gold has slightly increased in value year-on-year, while bitcoin has fallen by 75%. Tighter liquidity, the bank wrote, should be a “smaller drag on gold, which is more exposed to real demand drivers.” These include Asian consumer buying, central ban monetary demand, and industrial applications. BTCUSD chart via TradingView As CryptoGlobe reported, some investors are still bullish on BTC. Earlier this month billionaire investor Tim Draper, the founder of Draper Associates and one of Silicon Valle’s best-known investors, doubled down on his $250,000 Bitcoin price prediction, saying the cryptocurrency will hit that mark by June of next year. Draper isn’t the only billionaire bullish on crypto. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz has revealed that he still believes BTC will trade at $500,000 per coin in the future, but delayed his prediction over the Federal Reserve and other central banks raising interest rates to rein in inflation. Novogratz said that he believes $BTC will trade at $500,000 but “not in five years,” as per his words Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell found “his central banking superpowers.” Image Credit Featured Image via Unsplash ",2022-12-13

This means that there needs to be much more wreckage in the job market, which is yet to be seen, he added.Yet another obstacle for the Fed is that speculative assets have managed to stay afloat, according to Cramer. Bitcoin jumped to its highest level in over a month on Tuesday after the cooler-than-expected CPI reading – despite the spectacle of crypto exchange FTX's collapse. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday charged former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried with misappropriating funds.""Today should have been a huge victory for Jay Powell on a speculation front because part of beating inflation is draining out the speculative juices in the economy. Yet, there's still a ton of juice left to be drained from crypto,"" Cramer said.Both high wages and the resilience in crypto suggest that the Fed still has a long way to go, he concluded.""The Fed has to start somewhere in the fight against inflation and today's a good beginning, but … [Powell's] got to crush inflation for good,"" he said.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'FX Empire'}",Reuters,"Column-In the SEC’s suit against Bankman-Fried, what about the customers?: Frankel",By Alison Frankel (Reuters) -   Federal prosecutors and regulators from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission all told a similar story on Tuesday about Sam Bankman-Fried&#039;s alleged scheme to divert billi…,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/column-in-the-secs-suit-against-bankman-fried-what-about-the-customers-frankel-1229757,https://responsive.fxempire.com/width/600/webp-lossy-70.q50/_fxempire_/2022/12/tagreuters.com2022newsml_LYNXMPEIBC12Q2.jpg,2022-12-13 23:51:55+00:00,"They all accused Bankman-Fried of fraud, asserting that he repeatedly lied when he insisted that FTX customers money was safe, secure and completely segregated from the affiliated but purportedly ind… [+5646 chars]",FX Empire,"They all accused Bankman-Fried of fraud, asserting that he repeatedly lied when he insisted that FTX customers’ money was safe, secure and completely segregated from the affiliated but purportedly independent Alameda. According to the indictment unsealed on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan and separate complaints filed on Tuesday by the SEC and the CFTC, Bankman-Fried knew or should have known that money was being siphoned from FTX customer accounts to fund Alameda’s speculative trading and that, despite its repeated protestations to the contrary, FTX gave Alameda special trading privileges that ultimately proved disastrous for the platform and its customers. Who were the victims of this alleged fraud?  The CFTC’s complaint highlighted the deception of FTX users who, in the regulator’s telling, were duped into believing that their money was safe. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s indictment also cited FTX customers as the victims of wire fraud and commodities fraud charges against Bankman-Fried. But the SEC’s lawsuit focused on a different group of alleged victims: the investors that plowed $1.8 billion into FTX  in a series of stock purchases between 2019 and 2022. (The 90 U.S.-based FTX shareholders held a $1.1 billion stake, the SEC said.)  Reuters has reported that FTX’s equity investors included such firms as Sequoia Capital, SoftBank Group Corp, BlackRock Inc and Temasek – not exactly small-time crypto customers who wanted to trade on the FTX platform and trusted Bankman-Fried’s promises that their money would be secure. An important note here: Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, Mark Cohen of Cohen & Gresser, told Reuters on Tuesday that his client is “reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.” The SEC, meanwhile, did not respond to my query about the framing of its lawsuit. And to be fair, the SEC’s complaint, as I mentioned, cast FTX customers as victims, too, albeit parenthetically.  I’m being literal: The second sentence of the SEC’s complaint says, “Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.” My point is that the SEC’s pleading strategy in Tuesday’s lawsuit shows that crypto remains a big challenge for U.S. regulators. An alleged fraudster is accused of misappropriating billions of dollars from customers who wanted to buy and sell crypto, yet the foremost investor protection agency in the United States is not claiming securities fraud on behalf of those customers. Securities law professor Ann Lipton of Tulane University School of Law said that’s probably because of regulatory uncertainty about which crypto assets meet the definition of a security. (As you know, that question, in turn, is the subject of intense litigation between the SEC and Ripple Labs Inc.) “The SEC is limited to suing over securities fraud – and that requires the existence of a security,” Lipton said by email. “At the very least, each crypto asset would have to be analyzed individually to determine whether it was a security, which is presumably not feasible for customers who traded many different kinds of assets.” By focusing instead on the individuals and funds that acquired an equity stake in FTX, Lipton said, “The SEC ducks that issue – those investors certainly bought securities in the form of stock.” Former Manhattan federal prosecutor Timothy Howard of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer agreed: “It’s easier and more straightforward for the SEC to focus on equity investors.” Unlike private shareholders who sue for securities fraud, the SEC does not have to prove that investors relied on alleged misrepresentations. (The U.S. Justice Department, which has charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding FTX equity investors in addition to FTX customers, similarly does not have to show reliance to prove securities fraud.)  “This greatly eases the SEC’s and DOJ’s prosecutions because it takes off the table all questions associated with the adequacy of investors’ due diligence,” Stanford Law School professor Joseph Grundfest said via email. Many of the SEC’s allegations involve claims that FTX lied in publicly issued statements and reports on its websites. But, perhaps anticipating arguments from Bankman-Fried that he cannot be liable for general corporate statements, the SEC complaint did cite two instances in which FTX investors were allegedly misled by Bankman-Fried himself.  He gave a U.S. investor who had bought $35 million in FTX shares in July 2021 a document promising that FTX and Alameda did not comingle funds, according to the SEC. And in the late summer of 2021, the complaint alleged, Bankman-Fried told a potential U.S. investor who ultimately acquired a $30 million stake that FTX did not hold its native cryptocurrency, tokens known as FTT.  Bankman-Fried, according to the SEC, knew or should have known that his statement to the investor was false. Those specific allegations, said Freshfield’s Howard, seem intended to show Bankman-Fried that FTX investors are cooperating with the government – and that he can’t evade liability simply by claiming he wasn’t aware of FTX’s public statements. Looking way down the road at the potential fallout from FTX’s collapse, I’ll be interested to see if any FTX customers or creditors attempt to pin blame on the equity investors that are cast as victims in Tuesday’s SEC complaint, arguing that their due diligence failures enabled the platform’s subsequent alleged misconduct.  If that happens, it will be even more interesting to see if FTX’s equity investors point to their depiction in the SEC complaint as evidence that they, too, were victimized by Sam Bankman-Fried.

Ray III, who made his name overseeing the liquidation of Enron in the early 2000s, is the man in charge of sifting through the rubble of FTX, the once-mighty cryptocurrency exchange — founded in 2019 and run into the ground by 2022 by Sam Bankman-Fried.            On Tuesday, Ray testified before the House Financial Services Committee, relaying what he could about the company he took over just four weeks ago. When a congressman asked Ray how his experience with FTX compares with Enron, Ray was quick to make the distinction clear:            “The crimes that were committed [at Enron] were highly orchestrated financial machinations by highly sophisticated people to keep transactions off balance sheets,” Ray told lawmakers. FTX, on the other hand, was “not sophisticated at all.”           “This is really old-fashioned embezzlement,” Ray continued. “This is just taking money from customers, and using it for your own purpose.”           In other words: Look, there’s a lot going on here, but don’t let all the talk of digital assets confuse you — this is a con as old as time.            Mark Cohen, a lawyer for Bankman-Fried, said his client “is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.”          So, what’s happening? Quite a lot today:         Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York (aka, a really aggressive, elite bunch of lawyers who rarely lose when it comes to white-collar cases) charged Sam Bankman-Fried with eight charges of fraud and conspiracy. They say he misappropriated FTX customers’ deposits by using those funds to pay expenses and debts of Alameda, his crypto hedge fund.           US Attorney Damian Williams called the FTX case “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.”           Meanwhile, US markets regulators filed civil lawsuits accusing Bankman-Fried of defrauding investors and customers, saying he “built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto.”           And as if all that weren’t enough, Bankman-Fried’s successor, Ray, spent the day calling out the colossal mismanagement that took place before FTX and Alameda collapsed. In addition to calling the previous leaders “a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals” — under oath, mind you — Ray also illustrated that mismanagement by revealing that FTX used QuickBooks to run its business, which was valued at more than $30 billion at its peak. (Ray clarified: “Nothing against QuickBooks. It’s a very nice tool. Just not for a multibillion-dollar company.”)         Anything else?         So much… but I’ll stick to the highlights.            Bankman-Fried could face up to 115 years in prison if convicted on all eight counts against him in a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday morning, according to congressional statutory maximum sentencing guidelines.            (That said, he likely wouldn’t get the maximum sentence, and it’s not uncommon for a judge to have those sentences run concurrently.)            Bankman-Fried remains in the Bahamas, where FTX was based, and was arrested Monday night. He was arraigned Tuesday, and a Bahamian judge denied his request for bail, saying that he posed a flight risk. (His extradition to the United States is in the works, but that process can take weeks.)          What should we make of all this?          There’s still a ton we don’t know about the case. But the fact that prosecutors put together an eight-count, 14-page indictment just four weeks after FTX filed for bankruptcy suggests prosecutors may have an ace in the hole, and/or a preponderance of evidence against the company. (The SDNY are an aggressive people, but they are not sloppy, and they don’t indict without a solid case.)           Several lawyers not involved in the case have told me that the speed of Bankman-Fried’s arrest signals that former FTX employees may be aiding prosecutors.            “The smart move by former employees would be to rush to become a cooperator in exchange for more lenient treatment, and it would not be surprising to learn that one or more of them had done so,” said Howard A. Fischer, a former SEC lawyer. He added: “The fact that only one person has been charged so far would seem to indicate this as well.”       Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified John Ray. He is Sam Bankman-Fried's successor.  ",2022-12-13
