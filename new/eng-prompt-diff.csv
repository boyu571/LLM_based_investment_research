(NDR), which studied the relative performance of S&P 500 stocks from 1973-2020. Article content Article contentThis difference is nothing short of astronomical when coupled with the power of compounding. A $1-million investment in dividend payers over this period would have been valued at $68,341,836 as of the end of 2020, which is $60,070,380 more than the same amount invested in non-dividend-paying stocks would be worth.Within the dividend-paying complex, dividend growers and initiators have been the clear champions, with an annualized return of 10.4 per cent compared to 9.2 per cent for all dividend-paying stocks. A $1-million investment in dividend growers and initiators would have been valued at $115,482,326, which is $47,140,940 more than the same amount if the original sum had been invested in all dividend payers.Furthermore, dividend-paying companies have outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts while exhibiting lower volatility.NDR’s study also examined the relative performance of dividend payers versus non-payers in various macroeconomic environments, specifically the impact of inflation, economic growth and interest rates. Article content Article contentDividend-paying stocks have on average outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts regardless of whether inflation has been low, moderate or high. Unsurprisingly, dividend growers and initiators outperformed other dividend-paying companies during periods of moderate to high inflation.During recessions, dividend-paying stocks have underperformed non-payers by 2.5 per cent on an annualized basis. This shortfall pales in comparison to their 4.8 per cent outperformance during economic expansions, especially considering that economies spend far more time expanding than contracting.Once again, dividend growers and initiators have exhibited particularly strong performance, underperforming non-dividend payers by only 0.9 per cent during recessions while outperforming them by 5.6 per cent during expansions.As for interest rates, dividend payers underperformed non-payers by an annualized rate of 2.9 per cent during periods when 10-year rates were rising, but this shortfall pales in comparison to their blistering annual 9.4 per cent outperformance when rates were declining. Article contentOnce again, dividend growers and initiators stood out. They barely outperformed all dividend payers during periods of rising rates, but bested them by an annualized 1.8 per cent when rates were falling.The ability to consistently pay dividends suggests a company is mature, and has cash flow and cash on hand. These features enable dividend-paying companies to have lower volatility and to hold up better than their non-dividend-paying counterparts during market meltdowns.On a year-to-date basis through the end of October, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index has declined 8.7 per cent compared to a 17.7 per cent loss for the S&P 500 index. This is because high-quality dividend-paying companies typically pay dividends regardless of share price movement, which can mitigate losses in down markets.A company with a share price of $100 that pays $3 every year in dividends has a dividend yield of three per cent. If a bear market materializes and the stock price falls to $50 but the company maintains its annual payout of $3, then the stock’s dividend yield increases to six per cent. Article contentAssuming the company is financially stable, the new six-per-cent yield will provide what is referred to as “yield support.” The increased yield entices opportunistic bargain hunters to step in and buy the company’s stock, which slows, halts or even reverses its downward trajectory.Of course, there is the old notion that “there is no such thing as a free lunch,” that is, it’s impossible to get something for nothing. Notwithstanding their strong long-term performance, investors who are prone to FOMO (fear of missing out) be warned: there have and will be times when dividend payers underperform.Related Stories  Three hall-of-fame investors share the lessons they learned along the way   Cryptocurrency blowout shows disruption fuelled by easy money often only disrupts your portfolio   David Rosenberg: Why that 'remarkable' stock market rally was just another head fake FOMO sufferers who were heavily invested in dividend payers in 2007 would have watched in horror as the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index underperformed the S&P 500 by 7.6 per cent and the TSX Dividend Aristocrats index underperformed the TSX composite by 5.8 per cent. Article contentThey might have been similarly apoplectic in 2020-2021 as the liquidity-fuelled surge in growth stocks caused American and Canadian dividend payers to underperform their benchmarks by 15.5 per cent and 9.1 per cent, respectively.However, the fact remains that dividend-paying stocks have produced meaningful outperformance over the long term. Yet most dividend-focused managers have been unable to pass on the magic of dividend-paying stocks to investors.According to S&P Global Inc., 79.3 per cent of Canadian dividend-focused funds underperformed the TSX Dividend Aristocrats index over the 10 years ending June 30, 2022. The data over the past five years is even more daunting, with 88.1 per cent of managers underperforming.Francis Galton, a famous English statistician, was obsessed with measurement. His motto: “Wherever you can, count.” I agree with his assertion, particularly with respect to investing. To this end, I strongly believe a disciplined, rules-based investment process based on data, statistical analysis and machine learning can reap the full potential of dividend-paying stocks for investors.Noah Solomon is chief investment officer at Outcome Metric Asset Management LP._____________________________________________________________If you liked this story, sign up for more in the FP Investor newsletter._____________________________________________________________ Article content",0.8,0.0,0.8,0.0
U.S. Senate’s Warren Calls for Crackdown on ‘Sham’ Crypto Audits,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and another prominent colleague urged the U.S. auditing watchdog to take action against “sham audits” of crypto companies, citing the contribution of such audits to the recent stresses in the U.S. banking system.The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which is authorized and overseen by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and funded by audited public companies, acknowledged the potential problem with crypto auditing to the lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chair of the Senate Finance Committee.PCAOB Chair Erica Williams said she’s concerned when the auditors her organization oversees “perform ‘sham audits’ – even for entities whose audits generally fall outside of our jurisdiction,” as she wrote in a February response letter shared by the lawmakers.“Unfortunately, the PCAOB faces statutory limits when it comes to regulating the audits of certain cryptocurrency companies,” Williams wrote.Warren, who is on the Senate Banking Committee that oversees the SEC and will be instrumental in crafting crypto legislation, and Wyden argued the board does have more legal reach than it’s letting on and can act with “broad responsibility to protect the integrity of the auditing system,” according to a letter they sent to Williams on Tuesday.“Given that the ongoing use of sham audits of crypto firms conducted by PCAOB-registered auditors mislead the public and threatens the integrity of that auditing system – and we now know, potentially the banking and financial systems – you have both the authority and responsibility to rein them in,” the lawmakers argued.Earlier this month, the PCAOB’s inspector general had also recently issued a warning that crypto companies’ reserve reports were often based on untrustworthy information – not genuine auditing.Read More: Crypto Sector’s Reserve Reports Can’t Be Trusted, Says U.S. Audit Watchdog",-0.8,0.5,0.8,0.8

Venezuelans Selling Petro on LocalBitcoins at Half the Official Price,"Venezuelans are reportedly selling the state-launched Petro (PTR) cryptocurrency that was airdropped to them recently. Though the government claims to have fixed the value of one PTR at $60, the market price on LocalBitcoins is reported to be only half of that.According to a Reddit thread, Venezuelans are turning to LocalBitcoins to sell their airdropped Petro amid disastrous economic conditions. This follows an airdrop to a claimed 6 million people in December.The Reddit user claims that the government initially allowed the usage of Petro to buy products through a biometric app, but it soon shut it down as people flooded to the few stores that supported it.Some government exchanges are reported to support PTR as well, but the exchange rate deviated too much from the “official” price.The only option left for Venezuelans appears to be LocalBitcoins. Several listings can be found that accept Petro in exchange for Bitcoin or other currencies. However, all of them appear to be currently inactive. Several listings were still shown on the main page as late as Jan. 20.Source: LocalBitcoins.comCointelegraph reached out to Ernesto Pinto, one of the sellers on LocalBitcoins for clarifications.He confirmed that he does buy Petro from Venezuelans in exchange for Bitcoin (BTC). Pinto explained that the price was referenced from a local exchange, Amberescoin, which supported Petro. It amounted to 0.0036 BTC, or approximately $30 for one Petro.But the sellers are struggling due to the excessive selling pressure from the airdrop. Pinto is unable to accept Petro, as he cannot complete the full exchange cycle and sell the Petro he received previously.Pinto explained why:“The majority want to sell it because of an airdrop, where 8 million people want Bolivars because the Bolivar makes it easier to purchase things.”He also referred to a Telegram group where Venezuelans discuss and try to exchange Petros. One particular user in the chat asked for options in Maracaibo, the second-largest city in the country:“Anyone who sells food, rice, flour, sugar etc. and accepts Petros in Maracaibo?” ",-0.8,0.5,0.5,0.5

Citing volatility as a major issue, however, executives including Rainey continue to imply that merchants would rather pay PayPal’s fees and face the chance of upheaval over regulatory shifts than expose themselves to changing cryptocurrency prices. “The technology, there is real merit to it,” Rainey had told the WSJ.  I do think, though, it will be years down the road before we see the kind of ubiquity and acceptance that make it a form of currency that is used every day. PayPal has previously faced unforeseen regulatory hurdles both in Turkey and elsewhere.  The current status quo provides a conspicuous contrast to the vision that Peter Thiel, the company’s co-founder,  proclaimed to the press eighteen months ago. “PayPal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before,” he had said. Contrasts with Bitcoin meanwhile continue in the form of PayPal’s corporate timeline; having been bought by eBay, the acquirer dropped it as its payment partner in favor of Amazon’s Adyen.

Make a killing on NFTs and crypto? The IRS may tax them differently,"Non-fungible tokens are likely considered collectibles, which carry a 28% top federal tax rate on long-term capital gains, according to tax experts.That's higher than the 20% top rate that applies to investment returns for stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.However, the IRS hasn't explicitly said that NFTs are collectibles.  In the digital realm, all taxes aren't necessarily equal.Amid a cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) boom, wealthy owners may pay a different tax rate on investment growth in such holdings.Specifically, an investor who sells an NFT, such as digital art, may owe a top 31.8% federal tax rate on any earnings. By comparison, appreciation in bitcoin, ethereum and other digital coins is subject to a 23.8% top rate. More from Smart Tax Planning:Here's a look at more tax-planning news.Here's how to get a faster tax refundWhen to expect key forms for filing your tax returnElectric vehicle tax credits will be harder to get Here's a look at more tax-planning news.Here's how to get a faster tax refundWhen to expect key forms for filing your tax returnElectric vehicle tax credits will be harder to get That's because NFTs are likely collectibles, for tax purposes. Collectibles carry a higher maximum tax rate on capital gains relative to assets like stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies.The IRS hasn't explicitly said that NFTs are collectibles, leaving some room for interpretation. But many tax experts think they clearly belong in the same group as art, antiques, gems, metals, stamps and coins — which the IRS has labeled as tangible collectibles subject to the higher tax rate.""I don't see how it's not a collectible,"" said Jeffrey Levine, a St. Louis-based certified financial planner and accountant at Buckingham Wealth Partners, of NFTs. NFTs are essentially one-of-a-kind digital assets, which can extend beyond art to things like tweets and GIFs.The NFT market has grown quickly. Sales hit $6 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up from about $22 million the year before, according to NonFungible.com. In March, Christie's became the first major action house to sell NFT-based virtual artwork; the piece sold for $69 million. The numbers of NFT buyers has also swelled — to about 260,000 in the third quarter of last year, from 19,000 during the same period of 2020.Similarly, a crypto craze has gripped investors of late. More than 10% of American adults own cryptocurrency, with almost two-thirds buying in over the past year, according to a 2021 CNBC survey. Investors pay capital gains tax when they sell an asset. The levy is owed on any appreciation that accrued since purchase.The IRS generally taxes long-term capital gains at a top 20% federal rate. Long-term gains apply to crypto and other assets owned more than a year.In 2021, a single person with taxable income of more than $445,850 paid the 20% top rate. (Less affluent individuals pay a 0% or 15% capital-gains tax rate, depending on income.)Wealthier individuals also owe a 3.8% surtax on investment income, which kicks in at more than $200,000 of income for singles — for a total 23.8% federal tax rate on capital gains.However, collectibles — which tend to be owned by the super-wealthy — are subject to a different tax regime.Their long-term capital gains are taxed at a higher top federal rate, of 28%, and kick in at different income levels. The 3.8% surtax also applies.So, a wealthy NFT owner could owe up to 31.8% in federal taxes on the appreciation.""If you have artwork or a classic car, for example, you're [likely] a super-high-net-worth individual, which is why the IRS has this special long-term capital-gains tax rate,"" said Shehan Chandrasekera, an accountant and head of tax at CoinTracker. Confusingly, different income thresholds apply to capital gains taxes for collectibles, according to Troy Lewis, an associate professor of accounting and tax at Brigham Young University.Investors pay ordinary income-tax rates on collectibles' appreciation, up to a maximum 28%. (There are seven marginal income tax rates — 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% — which correspond with income.)""If your ordinary rates are below 28%, you pay your ordinary rates,"" Lewis, who also owns an accounting firm in Draper, Utah, said of collectibles. For example, a single taxpayer in the 22% tax bracket — which applied to income between roughly $41,000 and $86,000 last year — would pay a 22% top rate on the long-term appreciation of collectibles.Conversely, someone in the 37% bracket — which applies to income over about $524,000 — would see their collectible rate capped at 28%.In both examples, the taxpayer would owe a higher tax rate on NFT appreciation than that of crypto. Though prevailing thought among tax practitioners seems to be that NFTs are collectibles, the matter isn't necessarily closed.The IRS lists art and other ""tangible personal property"" as a collectible. NFTs likely fall under the ""art"" category, placing them in the collectible category; but NFTs are also intangible — placing them in a murky area of tax law.  ""Is it a collectible?"" Lewis said. ""It's not well settled yet because it's still a brand-new area.""",-0.8,0.5,-0.8,0.5
Why OnlyFans Is Double-Crossing Sex Workers,"OnlyFans—a website popularized as a place for the sharing and monetizing of erotic imagery—will stop allowing ""sexually explicit"" content as of October 1. ""In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""Creators will continue to be allowed to post content containing nudity as long as it is consistent with our Acceptable Use Policy."" The company attributed this change to pressure from banks and payment processors. ""These changes are to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers,"" its statement said. Asked to elaborate, a spokesperson for OnlyFans told me ""the platform has no further comments at this time."" Understandably, many sex workers who helped build up OnlyFans and now rely on the site for income are upset—and not mollified by promises that some nudity will still be allowed. ""Please consider telling sex workers that OF will still allow some nudity probably isn't helpful right now,"" tweeted podcaster and sex worker rights activist Phoenix Calida. ""Some of the policy is vague, there's a history of targeting & deplatforming SWs even when their content is within the guidelines. The fears & concerns are justified.""  When Facebook and Instagram ""updated their terms to crack down on explicit content. What Happened? A bunch of sws got banned for non sw posts. Everything from gofundmes for pets to bikini pics at the beach. All Bc they were sws,"" Calida added.  A lot of folks have been blaming OnlyFans' pivot away from porn on its desire to be more palatable to venture capitalists. Earlier this year, the company launched a PG version that can be downloaded from Apple and Google's app stores and features things ""like cooking tutorials, yoga routines and interviews,"" notes TechCrunch. ""OnlyFans is profitable, but to continue to grow, it is seeking funding at a valuation of over $1 billion."" ""OnlyFans would be nothing without the sex workers whose labor built it up into a major platform. Now it's tossing them aside,"" complained author Kim Kelly, in a sentiment that could be found across Twitter yesterday.  There's no doubt that OnlyFans is screwing over the very users who helped make it successful. But how much culpability the company has and how much anger it deserves are up for debate, since OnlyFans may be a victim in this too.  It may be accurate to say some are trying to cash out but I still think they wouldn't be in this position without the ""Onlyfans has sex trafficking"" articles. Why cash out when you can make 100x more? Only because they are scared of being completely defunded like PornHub https://t.co/8DZKL78WlP — Ashley Lake (@AshleyLatke) June 19, 2021  It's impossible to know how much of this decision relates to marketability and venture capital funding, and how much relates to insurmountable political and financial pressure. But the latter is a very real issue, and not one so easily overcome. It's plagued platform after platform that provide a digital home for sex workers. We saw this with Craigslist and Backpage, when they were the biggest purveyors of online sex work ads. Authorities pressured them to accept credit card payments, since these would be trackable and usable by prosecutors to help find and punish people who did use the site for exploitation. When Backpage agreed, it was then accused of profiting off exploitation; some even went so far as to threaten Visa and Mastercard if they wouldn't stop doing business with Backpage. Faced with political pressure and public accusations that they were facilitating sex trafficking, the credit card companies complied. The case had to go all the way to a federal appeals court, which ruled that the bullying of the credit card companies to drop Backpage had been unconstitutional. As this all played out, Backpage went back to free adult ads and tried alternative payment methods, like cryptocurrency. Both actions—moves brought about by unconstitutional political pressure—have since been used by prosecutors as evidence of criminal activity such as ""money laundering.""  Yep. And this is why ""blockchain solves this,"" isn't true unless we also fight back against repressive government attacks https://t.co/AfCUmwUCcx — Evan Greer (@evan_greer) August 20, 2021  The debacle highlights the impossible situation that platforms friendly to sex workers find themselves in these days, where almost any move they make short of ditching all adult elements will be used—in public pressure campaigns, civil lawsuits, and criminal prosecutions—to accuse them of serious wrongdoing. Specifically, activists toss around words like ""sex trafficking,"" ""human trafficking,"" and ""child sex abuse material"" with abandon, arguing that anything except total capitulation to moral groups' demands is a decision to willfully facilitate these things. Since Backpage was seized by the feds and Craigslist stopped allowing even personals ads, sites such as OnlyFans and Pornhub have become the next big targets of anti-porn and anti–sex work crusaders, with the media and lawmakers in their thrall. We've seen the same playbook used against porn sites as was previously used against classified-ad sites, with conservative groups—like the old Morality in Media, now rebranded as the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), and Exodus Cry—targeting the banks, credit card companies, and payment processors that enable these sites. Meanwhile, the same lawmakers that pushed FOSTA (the 2018 law making hosting prostitution ads a federal crime) have been pressuring the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate OnlyFans.  Blaming Onlyfans & not the real force behind it misdirects our energy. The same people behind this will not stop & will continue to pressure Mastercard/Visa to drop other sites too - just like they have to Pornhub & other ""free"" clipsites. We need to blame the real culprits — Avalon (@xFaeryPrincessx) August 19, 2021  I'm not saying that OnlyFans has made the right decision in choosing to stop allowing sexually explicit content. But maybe there is no right decision—and authorities have made sure that companies know that. The only ones to really stand up to political pressure and fight back in court have been the folks behind Backpage, and they've been shut down and criminally prosecuted for years, their assets seized and their founders facing the rest of their lives in prison. (The trial starts in September.) There's no doubt that officials wanted to send a message with Backpage, about what happens when platform operators refuse to just roll over and play along with the sex trafficking hysteria. The most perverse part of it all is that authorities and activists claim to be doing this to ""stop sexual exploitation"" and save women and children, but their charade only forecloses safer opportunities for sex work, making risk and exploitation more likely while sending digital markets for sex work overseas or underground. They admit this was the case with the Backpage seizure and the passage of FOSTA, yet they plow right ahead with the same antics with whatever new digital platforms become the most popular for sex work.  - sex workers find safer platform- usual suspects concern troll about human trafficking- sex workers get banned from the platform, forced to use less safe alternatives, decentralization of activity makes it harder to stop real cases of trafficking Great work as usual, society. https://t.co/ByWJPFQnne — Paul ⚡Tweeter Only In Theory⚡ Valentine (@paulrvalentine) August 20, 2021  Now, people are left with one fewer safe and profitable option to engage in sex work on their own terms. ""As anti-porn organizations celebrate, we brace ourselves for the crisis this will likely cause,"" said the Adult Performance Artists Guild in a statement. ""Workers in our industry have families to care for, and this change will push many into potential homelessness.""  I'm so sad.  Onlyfans was the most validating part of my entire 11 year career. After being told that I was not marketable and having few studios wanting to book me I became a top earner on there.  Anyways I'm still posting and creating just need to use Twitter as a diary rn lol — Arabelle Raphael (@ArabelleRaphael) August 20, 2021  It would be remiss to lay all the background blame on religious activists and government officials, of course. There are plenty of progressive and centrist feminists who crusade against sex work, too. And the progressive crusade in favor of devaluing free speech online and for holding the internet platforms and the infrastructure behind them (web hosting companies, email marketing companies, payment processors, etc.) responsible for user-generated content also puts us in this situation. ""This was the inevitable result not just of right wing fundamentalist moral panic over sex work, but also of DC based progressive nonprofits constantly calling for more deplatforming even at the infrastructure layer, and ignoring warnings about why it was a bad idea,"" tweets Evan Greer of the digital rights group Fight for the Future.   FREE MARKETS The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has refiled its antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The first time around, a federal court said the FTC hadn't proved Facebook was actually a monopoly. But the court left it open for the agency to amend its complaint and file again. In the new complaint, the FTC's monopoly argument still leaves a lot to be desired. To ""prove"" Facebook's monopoly status, it defines the relevant market—the sphere Facebook is supposed to be dominating—to exclude many of Facebook's competitors, including Twitter.  FREE MINDS Montana abortion laws challenged. Planned Parenthood has filed a lawsuit over Montana's latest abortion restrictions. From Fox News: The laws are set to take effect Oct. 1. They would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation; restrict access to abortion pills; require abortion providers to ask patients if they would like to view an ultrasound; and prohibit insurance plans that cover abortion procedures from being offered on the federal exchange. The lawsuit filed in Yellowstone District Court claims the laws violate Montana's constitution, which protects access to abortion before the fetus is viable, generally at 24 weeks gestation. It says the laws will reduce the number of locations where abortion services are offered and will threaten abortion providers with civil and criminal penalties.  QUICK HITS  Just spotted: Court dismisses almost all of the bogus lawsuit against Twitter.

Pipestone Announces That ISS Reaffirms Recommendation That Shareholders Vote “FOR” Proposed Combination With Strathcona to Create a Leading Canadian Energy Producer; ISS Says Dissident’s Arguments “Do Not Appear Well Supported”," Pipestone encourages all shareholders to vote FOR the Arrangement today to ensure their votes are counted; the proxy voting deadline is 10:00 a.m. (Calgary time) on Monday, September 25, 2023Have questions or need help voting? Call Kingsdale Advisors on 1-888-659-1824 (toll free in North America), email contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com, or visit www.pipestonestrathcona.com CALGARY, Alberta, Sept.  20, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (PIPE – TSX) Pipestone Energy Corp. (“Pipestone” or the “Company”) today announced that leading proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) has reviewed the arguments of GMT Capital Corp. (“GMT”) in its dissident proxy circular dated September 15, 2023 and reaffirmed its recommendation that shareholders vote FOR the proposed arrangement (the “Arrangement”) with Strathcona Resources Ltd. (“Strathcona”) that would see Pipestone and Strathcona combine to become one of Canada’s largest energy producers. “Upon review, the dissident arguments do not appear well supported and there is no clear indication as to whether a rejection of the deal would enhance shareholder value or lead to an enduring improvement in PIPE's share price. As such, ISS continues to recommend shareholders vote FOR the transaction,” ISS said. Shareholders of Pipestone (“Shareholders”) should not be distracted by GMT’s flawed and misleading arguments. As Pipestone has outlined in detail, the dissident circular of US-based GMT is rife with flawed assumptions and misleading arguments against this value-creating transaction. Click here to read Pipestone’s news release dated September 17, 2023 and click here to access the accompanying investor presentation, each of which provide in-depth rebuttals to GMT’s arguments. There is nothing new in GMT’s speculative arguments in its dissident proxy circular, which focuses on short-term, cherry-picked data, nor does GMT have a value-enhancing plan for the standalone Company. GMT’s argument can be summarized as nothing more than “kill the deal and hope for the best.” But hope is not a strategy the board of directors of Pipestone (the “Board”) and Pipestone can support. Neither should Shareholders. By contrast, Pipestone believes that the Arrangement offers numerous advantages for Shareholders. The all-share consideration will enable Shareholders to fully participate in the upside of a much larger and more diversified producer that is expected to benefit from scale at 185,000 boe/d; a well-positioned reserves base and much longer life at over 38 years; better access and lower cost to capital; extending our tax shelter by over two years; and a potential positive re-rating by markets. The independent committee (the “Special Committee”) of the Board and the Board have determined that the Arrangement is in the best interests of Pipestone and the Shareholders and it has the full, signed backing of management of Pipestone. “We are pleased to see the continued support for the Arrangement from independent parties such as ISS. Management fully supports the Arrangement which we believe is superior to the status quo, significantly reducing the go-forward technical risk of the business while allowing Pipestone shareholders to participate in future upside,"" said Dustin Hoffman, Chief Operating Officer and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Pipestone. The determinations of the Special Committee and the Board came after an extensive and robust strategic review process that considered all alternatives available to Pipestone, including the arguments and options put forward by GMT, and was supported by the advice of Pipestone’s financial and legal advisors. The 18-month strategic review process that began in early 2022 evaluated over 75 potential counterparties. In February 2023 Pipestone received an initial proposal from Strathcona. The terms of the Strathcona proposal were improved through several revised proposals. The definitive arrangement agreement with Strathcona was signed on July 31, 2023 and includes support agreements from management and Riverstone Holdings LLC, a significant and highly sophisticated shareholder in Pipestone. Throughout Pipestone’s thorough strategic review process, the Special Committee and the Board consistently compared the Strathcona transaction to the status quo as a standalone single-asset producer, and against other potential alternatives for the Company. Those included alternatives identified during the long and robust strategic review process and included those put forward by GMT. The recommendations that Shareholders vote “FOR” the Arrangement by the independent proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis underscore the Board’s recommendation. The job of ISS and Glass Lewis is to review transaction terms and process in detail and offer proxy voting guidance to investment managers, mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors. Pipestone once again thanks Shareholders for the strong support they have shown so far by voting FOR the Arrangement and encourages all Shareholders to vote FOR the Arrangement before 10:00 a.m. (Calgary time) on Monday, September 25, 2023. Details on how to do so can be found below. PIPESTONE SPECIAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING Shareholders must take action to vote by proxy before 10:00 a.m. (Calgary time) on Monday, September 25, 2023 On August 28, 2023, Pipestone filed a management information circular (the “Circular”) and related meeting materials (the “Meeting Materials”) in connection with the special meeting of Shareholders (the “Meeting”).

The sole purpose of the Meeting is for the Shareholders to consider and, if deemed advisable, approve the Arrangement. Further details regarding the Meeting are set forth in the Circular.

Production and Reserves Information The reserves estimate in this press release is based on Pipestone's internal evaluation and were prepared by a member of Pipestone's management who is a qualified reserves evaluator in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities. The growth potential of the pro forma entity is based on: (i) in respect of Strathcona, (a) the report prepared by Sproule Associates Limited dated February 23, 2023 evaluating the petroleum and natural gas reserves and contingent resources attributable to certain of the assets of Strathcona as at December 31, 2022, (b) the report prepared by McDaniel & Associated Consultants Ltd. (""McDaniel"") dated February 1, 2023 evaluating the bitumen reserves and contingent resources attributable to certain of the assets of Strathcona as at December 31, 2022, and (c) the report prepared by McDaniel dated February 14, 2023 evaluating the heavy oil reserves and contingent resources attributable to certain of the assets of Strathcona as at December 31, 2022, and (ii) in respect of Pipestone, report prepared by McDaniel dated February 13, 2023 evaluating the crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves attributable to Pipestone's properties as at December 31, 2022. Such estimates constitute forward-looking statements, which are based on values that Pipestone's management believes to be reasonable. For further information regarding the reserves of Strathcona and Pipestone, see the Meeting Materials and the annual information form of Pipestone dated March 8, 2023 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a copy of which is available on Pipestone's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca, respectively. Barrels of Oil Equivalent This press release contains references to ""boe"" (barrels of oil equivalent). Pipestone has adopted the standard of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) when converting natural gas to boes. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. The foregoing conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and do not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading.

Government grants ASIC wish to ban binary options - The Australian Financial Review,"Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones has backed the corporate regulator’s longstanding plan to ban retail investors from trading so-called binary options – a complex derivative product likened to gambling.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has extended a ban on the issue and sale of binary options to retail clients (that is, those with less than $2.5 million in assets) until October 31, 2031.ASIC says Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones has given its binary options ban a green light.  Alex EllinghausenBinary options are risky, speculative investments which allow traders to take an “all-or-nothing” position on the future price of an asset, and a 50 per cent chance of losing their money.ASIC has tried to ban binary options since at least 2017, when a review of the market found about 80 per cent of retail investors lost money trading these products.The regulator used its then-new product intervention powers in April last year to temporarily outlaw binary options trade. But it was required to publicly consult and seek ministerial approval before the ban could be extended from October until the end of the decade.",-1.0,0.5,0.5,0.8
": Silvergate announces departures of CEO, CFO, legal chief","             Silvergate Capital Corp., as part of its plan to wind down operations and liquidate the assets of Silvergate Bank, announced departure plans for its chief executive and chief financial officer in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Tuesday.  Silvergate Capital          SICP,         +0.05%        said Alan Lane, CEO of both the holding company and the bank, and John Bonino, chief legal officer of the company and the bank, no longer held those positions effective Tuesday. Effective Sept. 30, Antonio Martino, CFO of both the company and bank, will depart from those positions, Silvergate said.   In the filing, the company said the executives will “no longer be entitled to any further compensation under each of their respective employment agreements, but each will receive certain severance benefits provided to bank employees being discharged in the course of the bank liquidation.”  Silvergate said Kathleen Fraher, chief transition officer of the company and the bank, now serves as the company’s principal executive officer, while Andrew Surry, chief accounting officer of the bank, will serve as the company’s principal financial officer when Martino leaves.  Shares of Silvergate were unchanged after hours, following a 35% rise to close Tuesday at 30 cents a share. Year to date, Silvergate shares have shed 98%, and had once closed as high as $222.13 back on Nov. 3, 2021, according to FactSet data. In March, Silvergate was forced to wind down operations of cryptocurrency-friendly Silvergate Bank. That occurred a few days before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10. Crypto-friendly Signature Bank failed on March 12, and was acquired by New York Community Bancorp. NYCB,         -1.66%        in May. Prior to the announced wind-down plans in March, ongoing concern over Silvergate’s ability to stay afloat had triggered selloffs of bitcoin          BTCUSD,         +2.88%        and ether          ETHUSD,         +2.57%,        following announcements from Coinbase Global Inc.

Same number for internet / social / or even traditional industries,” the Binance CEO added.  CZ Isn’t Alone in Thinking So Changpeng Zhao isn’t the first prominent executive and investor to suggest that a vast majority of cryptocurrencies are unlikely to perform well. There are many other commentators that are coming out against a majority of altcoin projects. Jason Calacanis, an angel investor in Robinhood and Uber, recently said that he thinks 99% of crypto projects have no merit. Calacanis’ comment was in reference to his opinion that most crypto founders have no vision or experience to be doing what they are doing and thus are doomed to fail. His comment has been echoed by Kevin Rose, who said to TechCrunch in June: “The problem is that 99% of the projects out there and a lot of the people who are behind them are just in this for the pure financial gain. And there’s a lot of garbage out there. And that’s unfortunate because it really drags down the high-quality projects, and it muddies the space quite a bit.” Featured Image from Shutterstock  Price tags: xbtusd, btcusd, btcusdt  Charts from TradingView.com  Binance CEO: 95% of Crypto Projects Are Unlikely to ""Pump"" This Cycle  ",0.8,0.5,-0.9,-0.8

Why Ethereum’s price rise is not cause for celebration yet,"       Ethereum’s price increased by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.  However, market indicators were bearish, suggesting a change in trends.  The Binance and Coinbase episode with the US Securities Exchange Commission caused havoc in the crypto industry. It caused a decline in the supply of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] on Binance, suggesting that investors were losing confidence in CEXes.   Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24  Ethereum investors’ confidence in Binance declined Glassnode’s latest tweet revealed that after the SEC incident, investors actively withdrew their ETH and BTC from Binance. As per the tweet, Ethereum’s balance on Binance was around 4.56 million to 4.2 million.   Since the SEC charges, the #Bitcoin and #Ethereum Balance on #Binance has declined by -48K BTC and -360K ETH respectively. 🟡 BTC Balance: 706K BTC to 658K BTC (-48K BTC)🔵 ETH Balance: 4.56M ETH to 4.2M ETH (-360K ETH) pic.twitter.com/rOKZpfgJwn — glassnode (@glassnode) June 15, 2023  This indicated that they were losing faith in the CEX. In order to keep their holdings safe, investors were moving their assets to self-custody, or DEXes. This was evident from Dune’s data.       After a decline, ETH’s volume on DEXes registered an uptick, as per the chart ETH’s DEX volume has increased on multiple projects such as Curve [CRV], Uniswap [UNI], and more since 11 June.

"Best Bitcoin Cash Casinos: Ranking the Best Bitcoin Cash Casinos by BCH Games, Bonuses, and More","Are you looking for the best Bitcoin Cash casinos available right now? You are in luck! That’s exactly what we are going to discuss in today’s article. After extensive research and numerous casinos checked, we found Bitstarz to be the overall best casino accepting Bitcoin Cash payments. However, there are many others that we have ranked and rated below. Let’s dive right in. Best Bitcoin Cash Casinos  Bitstarz: Best overall Ignition: Best for poker Super Slots: Best for live games MyStake: Most generous bonuses Bovada: Best for sports betting Red Dog: Best for new players 7Bit Casino: Best for jackpot slots mBit Casino: Best for free spin bonuses Wild.io: Best design Crypto Loko: Best for high rollers  1. Bitstarz – Best Bitcoin Cash Casino Overall    Bitcoin Cash casinos offer a number of stand-out features in relation to land-based betting venues and traditional  online gambling sites .    Pros:  4,000+ casino games from leading providers Exciting welcome bonus for BCH players 20 no-deposit free spins for all new users Variety of cryptocurrencies supported Amazing customer support team  Cons:  Cluttered website  Bitstarz is a very well-known online crypto casino with a lot to offer. It is very popular among crypto players and accepts a variety of digital coins, including Bitcoin Cash. Let’s see what makes it our top pick today.       Betting Variety: 4.95/5 At Bitstarz, there’s virtually nothing you can’t play – from crypto slots and jackpots to unique specialty titles and classic table games; they have new players covered with 4,000+ options. Casino traditionalists can try their luck with about 1,000 exclusive crypto reels, and there are tens of virtual blackjack and baccarat tables to explore in between spins. If you’re looking for something a bit more light-hearted, you can roll a 100-sided die or play Limbo for a chance to win BCH! 10+ video poker variants round out their game selection for everybody. Welcome Bonus: 4.95/5 Before you decide to stick around with Bitstarz, verify your email address. You’ll receive 20 free spins with no prior deposit required! If you like what you see, make your first deposit with BCH – Bitstarz will double your money up to 100 BCH plus 180 free spins.         Crypto Compatibility: 4.9/5 In addition to Bitcoin Cash, you can use BTC, Litecoin, Ethereum, and DOGE to deposit funds at Bitstarz. If you don’t have any crypto on-hand, you can buy Bitcoin Cash tokens with one click directly on their website! Their welcome bonus requires a minimum deposit of 0.17 BCH. However, you can start playing 4,000+ games with just 0.034 BCH to spare. All crypto transactions are rocketed to your personal wallet in just 5-10 minutes! Customer Support: 4.9/5  Bitstarz’s customer support team has accrued 2,000+ positive reviews from verified players. While this told us everything we needed to know ahead of time, our experts decided to test their 24/7 chat feature anyway. As expected, we got an immediate and helpful response from a real person! If you’re dealing with a complex issue, using their email hotline is the better choice. You can also find Bitstarz on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram.       Follow this link to find out more about the latest Bitstarz bonuses by clicking here. 2. Ignition – Best Bitcoin Cash Online Casino for Poker  Pros:  24/7 live poker rooms 250+ Bitcoin games $3,000 poker and casino bonus Accepts 5 forms of cryptocurrency Chat, email, and Forum-based support  Cons:  Not the best mobile gaming library  Ignition promises a well-rounded betting experience with 250+ crypto slots, classic table games, “Hot Drop” Jackpots, and live dealer titles. However, Ignition’s unprecedented library of poker is the main attraction. Betting Variety: 4.8/5 First and foremost, Ignition appeals to seasoned poker players with non-stop action. Reserve your seat and play poker in real-time with just $5 to spare! You’ll compete against thousands of very average online players, and Ignition’s cash tables are 5%-10% softer than average.   In between rounds, you can explore 250+ Bitcoin Cash games or take a peek at their jam-packed “Tournaments” section. Ignition hosts numerous freerolls, high-stakes matchups, and budget-friendly buy-ins throughout the week. Most notably, their “Monthly Milly” tournament offers a $1M guaranteed prize pool! Welcome Bonus: 4.95/5 Ignition’s double-ended welcome package caters to casino traditionalists and seasoned poker players in one swift motion. Make your first qualifying BCH deposit to get started! For your trouble, you’ll receive a match bonus worth up to $3,000.  150% of their welcome package is allocated towards Ignition’s crypto slots and tables, while the remaining 150% match up to $1,500 is reserved exclusively for live poker games and tourneys. Crypto Compatibility: 4.85/5 You can use a debit card, MatchPay, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, ETH, and USDT to deposit funds at Ignition. While they are a crypto-focused casino, it’s nice to see other options supported here too.       Either way, you must deposit at least $20 in crypto or $25 in cash before redeeming your $3,000 welcome package. Ignition offers very flexible payout minimums, so you can withdraw anywhere between $10 and $9,500 per transaction! Bitcoin Cash payouts are processed and delivered within 24 hours. Customer Support: 4.9/5 Even without dedicated phone support, Ignition promises white-glove service for every player that signs up with the platform. You can use their 24/7 live chat feature if you need immediate assistance, and their free Player Forums are packed with helpful information from real people. Finally, if you need detailed “one-on-one” support, we’d suggest sending them an email. Our experts got a reply from a real agent just 6 hours after reaching out with a complex question. Check out the Ignition website and start playing poker now. 3. Super Slots – Best Bitcoin Cash Casino for Blackjack Players          Pros:  20+ live dealer table games 300+ cutting-edge crypto titles 400% crypto bonus up to $4,000 Accepts 18 forms of cryptocurrency 24/7 live chat + email support  Cons:  High cash payout requirements  Super Slots’ name isn’t exactly misleading, but they’re better known for their collection of 20+ live games than anything else. Players who opt into their “Wild Diamond 7’s” $1 side bet can take home six-figure prizes while enjoying round after round of live blackjack. Betting Variety: 4.85/5 Super Slots accommodates a wide variety of player preferences with 300+ crypto slots, virtual tables, video poker variants, and unique specialty titles. Between their “Black” and “Red” live casino sections, we also found 20+ variants of blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and Super 6. However, high rollers and card game enthusiasts should check out their live blackjack tables. If you get three Diamond 7’s in any game of live blackjack, you’ll take home their six-figure grand prize. Even if you get one or two special cards, there’s a very special treat in store!       Welcome Bonus: 4.9/5 Use the bonus code “CRYPTO400” with your first Bitcoin Cash deposit of $20 or more. Super Slots will quadruple your existing bankroll and credit your account with a 400% match up to $4,000! No matter your budget, you won’t play casino games with less than $100 to spend. Crypto Compatibility: 4.8/5 Aside from Bitcoin Cash, Super Slots accepts 17 other forms of cryptocurrency. Even though you can use a debit card, P2P transfer, money order, or wire transfer to bank your funds, we’d advise against betting with fiat here. Before requesting a traditional fiat payout, you’ll have to win between $50 and $500. Bummer! Thankfully, all Bitcoin Cash transactions start from just $20. You can deposit or withdraw as much as $100,000 at a time, which might come in handy if you win their six-figure jackpot! Customer Support: 4.8/5       If you have any questions or concerns, Super Slots is here to help. They prioritize your satisfaction, and they offer two 24/7 contact methods for your convenience. Their built-in chat feature spits back instantaneous replies from live agents, so that should be your first choice. However, their support email doesn’t go without merit. Players with complex inquiries or individual problems are encouraged to send Super Slots a more detailed message. Follow this link to visit Super Slots and find out more about all of its bonuses. 4. MyStake – Most Generous Bonuses of All Bitcoin Cash Casinos  Pros:  17+ ongoing promotions 6,000+ crypto slots and tables Countless sports betting markets Accepts 10 different cryptocurrencies 24/7 live chat and email support  Cons:  Cluttered homepage  MyStake launched in 2020, but they’ve already ascended to mainstream popularity. As a new player, you’ll have 6,000+ crypto games, countless sports betting markets, and 17+ exclusive promotions at your fingertips.       Betting Variety: 4.85/5 MyStake is something of an international superstar, and they host 6,000+ crypto games for players in multiple countries. However, depending on your region, a few hundred titles may be “off-limits.” Then again, with so many titles to choose from, we doubt you’ll notice the difference. Additionally, MyStake doubles as a crypto sportsbook. They cover hundreds of betting markets across 45+ sports categories, but many of them aren’t competitive. On the bright side, their “Boosted Odds” are certainly worth your next wager. Welcome Bonus: 5/5 MyStake’s list of bonuses and promotions might appear endless, but our experts counted 17+ sports and casino-related offers. If you’re looking for a bit of guidance, we’ve got you covered. Not to mention their 35% sports reload bonus, sportsbook veterans can redeem a similar 100% match worth up to $500. Plus, every player can take advantage of their social media giveaways. Finally, all deposits made with Bitcoin Cash will qualify you for 10% “forever” cashback.       Crypto Compatibility: 4.8/5 MyStake accepts 10 forms of cryptocurrency. New sign-ups can use Bitcoin Cash, BTC, ETH, LTC, USDT, XMR, Dash, and Ripple to bank their funds and request payouts. Regardless of your preferred cryptocurrency, you must deposit $20 or more to claim bonuses and play games. Their withdrawal limits are similarly accessible, and they range from $20 to $15,000 per transaction. MyStake follows in Bitstarz’s footsteps with same-day crypto payouts! Of course, you won’t have to deal with any processing fees when you use Bitcoin Cash to play here. Customer Support: 4.75/5 While MyStake launched fairly recently in 2020, they fiercely compete with established brands in the customer support department. You can get in touch with a real person around the clock! Better still, our team enjoyed quick, professional, and helpful responses via live chat and email. Follow this link to visit MyStake and score your welcome bonus.       5. Bovada – Best Bitcoin Cash Casino With Sports Betting  Pros:  32+ sports categories Highly competitive odds 300+ crypto slots + tables Claim up to $3,750 in bonuses Phone, email, and live chat support  Cons:  Lines are sometimes posted late  Bovada is a reputable, well-known sportsbook that recently began accepting Bitcoin Cash. Over the past decade, they’ve earned a solid reputation for listing highly competitive odds across 32+ sports categories. Betting Variety: 4.65/5 It’s no secret that Bovada heavily appeals to sportsbook veterans. From horse racing and eSports to MMA/UFC and college football, there’s nothing you can’t wager on at Bovada. Our experts uncovered hundreds of betting markets across 32+ popular sports categories. They’re known for posting the most competitive odds the industry has to offer, but they’ll occasionally list money lines a bit too close to game time for comfort. Notably, if you win too much BCH from an eight-game parlay, you’ll be presented with less attractive odds over time.       Welcome Bonus: 4.7/5 Casino traditionalists should use the bonus code “BTCCWB1250” with each of their first three BCH deposits. For every qualifying transaction in excess of $20, you’ll receive a 125% casino match worth up to $1,250. The welcome package can go up to $3,750 in total! Sports fans should use the promo code “BTCSWB750” instead. Bovada will match your first BCH deposit of $20 or more by 75% up to $750. Their 5x sports rollover is among the lowest in the industry. Crypto Compatibility: 4.65/5 Bovada accepts payments made with BTC, Bitcoin Cash, LTC, ETH, and USDT. You’ll have to deposit at least $20 before claiming each component of Bovada’s triple-tiered welcome bonus. You can also use a debit card to play here, but you’ll be forced to deposit $25 or more.       Bitcoin Cash gamblers can withdraw as little as $10 or as much as $9,500 per transaction. High rollers should know that Bovada’s weekly BCH payout limit is $180,500. Still, regardless of your budget, you’ll enjoy fast and fee-free payouts. Customer Support: 5/5 Bovada’s customer support team is their pride and joy. As you might expect, they promise quick and helpful replies across the board! Plus, they have a dedicated phone number for players to call. Our experts waited on hold for less than 10 minutes before speaking with a real person. Of course, you can use their built-in 24/7 chat feature for much quicker assistance. Follow this link and start betting on your favorite sports at Bovada.

No matter how great their bonuses or games may appear, unlicensed online casinos are not trustworthy as a general rule. What’s the Difference Between a Bitcoin Cash Casino and A Regular Casino? A regular online casino is guaranteed to accept fiat currencies, whereas a Bitcoin Cash Casino is guaranteed to accept Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Still, they share more similarities than differences, and modern-day online casino sites accept multiple forms of crypto alongside fiat. Here’s where the primary difference lies.

"Hive Ransomware Gang Hits 1,300 Businesses, Makes $100 Million","The Hive ransomware gang has victimized more than 1,300 businesses, receiving over $100 million in ransom payments over the past year and a half, US government agencies say. Active since June 2021 and offered as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), Hive has been used in attacks against businesses and critical infrastructure entities, including communications, government, healthcare, IT, and critical manufacturing organizations. In an effort to increase awareness of Hive ransomware, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have released a joint alert detailing observed indicators of compromise (IoCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Depending on the affiliate disseminating Hive, initial access into the victim’s network may be obtained via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), virtual private networks (VPNs), and other remote connection protocols that have not been secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA). In some Hive ransomware attacks, the threat actors were observed bypassing MFA and exploiting CVE-2020-12812 to access FortiOS servers, the joint alert reads. Hive affiliates have also been seen sending phishing emails with malicious attachments and targeting known Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-34473, and CVE-2021-34523). After gaining access to a victim’s network, the Hive ransomware attempts to identify and terminate processes related to antimalware, backups, and file copying, to stop volume shadow copy services and remove existing copies, and to delete Windows event logs. Prior to encryption, the cybercriminals also exfiltrate data of interest from compromised Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi, and FreeBSD systems.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.   Hive creates a file with the .key extension in the root directory – this file, which is unique to the system it was created on, is required for decryption. A ransom note is dropped into each affected directory, warning victims not to tamper with the .key file, as that would prevent data recovery, and directing victims to contact the attackers via live chat on a website accessible via the Tor browser. The ransom note also threatens victims that, if a ransom is not paid, data would be made public on the Tor site ‘HiveLeaks’. The Hive threat actors were also seen using anonymous file sharing sites to leak stolen data. “Once the victim organization contacts Hive actors on the live chat panel, Hive actors communicate the ransom amount and the payment deadline. Hive actors negotiate ransom demands in US dollars, with initial amounts ranging from several thousand to millions of dollars. Hive actors demand payment in Bitcoin,” CISA, FBI, and HHS say. The three agencies also warn that Hive actors have been observed reinfecting – either with Hive or other ransomware variant – victims that restored their environments without paying a ransom.

Binance faces legal battle as US regulator gets ready to rumble,"In this issueBinance: In the dockDo Kwon: Journey’s endHong Kong crypto: State-sanctionedFrom the editor’s deskDear Reader,It’s a rare thing when corporate spokespeople say much that could be considered interesting, let alone revealing. Yet that’s just what Binance’s communications folks have done following the news that the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange is being sued for allegedly breaking U.S. law.In a statement responding to the lawsuit the U.S. Commodity Futures and Trading Commission has brought against Binance and its co-founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, over alleged breaches of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, the company called for the development of a “clear, thoughtful regulatory regime.”So far, so bland, right? Perhaps. But in arguably the world’s most litigious country, the law must be nothing if not clear. And when it comes to finance in the home of the world’s deepest and most liquid capital markets, things don’t get much more crystal than the rules and regulations. And as it happens, this comes in the same week that another U.S. agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed a Wells notice to crypto exchange Coinbase, signaling that enforcement action is coming. Coinbase is apoplectic, and its frustration is summed up simply in a tweet posted by its chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, who said: “After years of asking for reasonable crypto rules, we’re disappointed that the SEC is considering courts over constructive dialogue.”    Binance’s call for regulatory clarity is unassailable, as is Coinbase’s, and it’s representative of a view shared across the rest of the crypto industry as it struggles to emerge from the shadow of last year’s traumatic busts and blowouts. Whether the CFTC’s allegations hold up or not, Binance has a colorful history when it comes to regulation and compliance. Yet the exchange’s move late last year to set up a recovery fund for distressed crypto assets — quibbles over its size aside — was an admirable gesture that appeared to signal a new determination on its part to get on the right side of things. As was Binance’s announcement last summer that it would establish a global headquarters and a transparent, professional management structure. But perhaps these were all well-strategized moves to counter potential earlier missteps in this game of regulatory chess. And that continues to play out. Many pieces have fallen. Following the enormous sense of betrayal the crypto industry has been saddled with by fellow crypto-kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried, there is a political tailwind to the actions of the CFTC and SEC this week.   But until the judge’s gavel falls, it seems that the crypto industry is in for yet more soul-searching as it seeks sturdier ground. Internationally, regulators are taking notice too. This game of chess is a global one, and we await the next move.Until the next time,Angie Lau,Founder and Editor-in-ChiefForkast1. Risky businessBinance’s latest troubles in the U.S. are just the most recent in a long line of problems the exchange has had with regulators around the world. Image: CanvaBy the numbers: Binance — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has sued Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and its co-founder and chief executive, Changpeng Zhao for allegedly illegally offering unregistered cryptocurrency derivatives in the U.S.The CFTC filed a civil enforcement action on Monday accusing Binance and Zhao, also widely known as “CZ,” with alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Samuel Lim, Binance’s former chief compliance officer, was also sued for allegedly aiding and abetting Binance’s violations.“Since the launch of its platform in 2017, Binance has taken a calculated, phased approach to increase its United States presence despite publicly stating its purported intent to ‘block’ or ‘restrict’ customers located in the United States from accessing its platform,” the complaint said.Crypto exchanges must register with the CFTC before providing crypto derivative services in the U.S., but Binance did not do so. In August 2020, Binance earned US$63 million in fees from derivatives transactions, and around 16% of its accounts were held by customers located in the U.S., according to the CFTC.Binance and its staff stand accused of evading CFTC regulation on purpose through measures such as instructing U.S. customers to obscure their locations with virtual private networks and intentionally structuring their entities and transactions to avoid registration requirements, according to the CFTC.Through the litigation, the CFTC is seeking monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and an order to prevent Binance from violating the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.Zhao tweeted the number “4” on Monday in response to the CFTC’s accusations, a reference to a Jan. 2 tweet in which he said “4” meant “ignore FUD” — fear, uncertainty and doubt — “fake news, attacks, etc.”Binance later responded to the CFTC in a blog post in which Zhao claimed the regulator’s complaint “appears to contain an incomplete recitation of facts” and that Binance would “continue to respect and collaborate with U.S. and other regulators around the world.”Binance has faced mounting regulatory challenges in the U.S. Prior to the CFTC complaint, the exchange was probed by the Justice Department over potential anti-money-laundering law infractions and by the Securities and Exchange Commision over suspected sales of unregistered securities.In February, Binance corporate partner Paxos Trust was ordered by U.S. authorities to stop issuing the Binance USD stablecoin after it was identified by the SEC as an unregistered security.BNB, Binance’s native token, was trading at US$318.11 midweek in Asia, down more than 3% from a daily high of US$329.33 on Monday, according to data from CoinGecko.Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?Changpeng Zhao described the filing of a lawsuit by the CFTC against Binance as “unexpected,” but the regulator has been probing his crypto exchange since 2021. The CFTC has been investigating whether Binance has sufficient measures in place to keep U.S. residents from buying and selling crypto derivatives. CFTC rules generally require platforms to register with it if they let Americans trade such products. Binance has, for years, seemed unwilling to comply, and the CFTC says the exchange has made millions of dollars by doing so. The regulator has also accused Binance of not doing enough to combat money laundering. According to CFTC’s complaint, since at least last May, Binance had not filed a single suspicious activity report in the U.S. For an industry in which such activity is rife, it seems odd that the world’s biggest exchange wouldn’t have been a conduit for at least some shady money.  The CFTC can’t bring criminal charges against firms or seek jail time for individuals, but it can further damage the reputation of an exchange that has thus far managed to shrug off a lot of lawsuits as well as consternation by other regulators. 2. Lost and foundTerraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon’s flight from justice has finally ended, and his legal woes are just beginning. Image: Woohae Cho/BloombergBy the numbers: Do Kwon — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.Kwon Do-hyung, co-founder of collapsed Terraform Labs, has been arrested in the Balkan nation of Montenegro, more than six months after Interpol issued a red notice for the wanted crypto entrepreneur. Do Kwon, as he is better known, is facing multiple charges by authorities in the U.S., South Korea and Montenegro, and possible extradition.Do Kwon, alongside Han Chang-jun, the former chief executive of Terra-affiliated Chai Corporation, was arrested by the police at an airport in Montenegro last Thursday, allegedly traveling on forged documents, South Korean police told Forkast.Following Do Kwon’s arrest, U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment for him on eight charges, including securities fraud, commodities fraud and conspiracy, according to a Bloomberg report. He has also been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with alleged crypto asset securities fraud.Terraform Labs was behind the collapse of the Terra-Luna stablecoin last May, which wiped out an estimated US$40 billion, affecting around 280,000 investors in South Korea alone. South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for him last September, and his whereabout had been largely unknown until now.Both the U.S. and South Korea are seeking Do Kwon’s extradition. A court in Montenegro will hold an extradition hearing after it makes a decision on his forgery charges, according to a report by AFP. Since Do Kwon was detained, South Korean prosecutors have been making renewed efforts to arrest Terraform Labs co-founder Shin Hyun-seung, also known as Daniel Shin, according to a Bloomberg report. Shin is said to have cut ties with Do Kwon in 2020 and has been cooperating with South Korea’s investigation of the Terra-Luna collapse.South Korean prosecutors sought in November 2022 to detain Shin, who allegedly earned as much as US$100 million from the Terra-Luna debacle, but they failed to convince a court to issue an arrest warrant. Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?Do Kwon’s arrest is noteworthy for many reasons. His detention is not only a victory for law enforcement but it represents a significant change in how authorities regard crypto crime. At the time, the collapse of Terra’s token was chalked up as indicative of the inherent flaws of algorithmic stablecoins, and the technology was pilloried as the reason why so much money was lost. But thanks to the persistent efforts of law enforcement agencies, that narrative is now changing. One part of the history being rewritten concerns the role FTX and affiliated companies may have played in breaking the Terra-Luna relationship for profit. The other, and the reason for Do Kwon’s arrest, is how he and others allegedly managed to siphon billions of dollars from investors while propping up liquidity, in addition to developers’ apparent concealment of vulnerabilities in the project’s code.  The wheels of justice may seem to turn slowly for those accused of crypto crimes, but law enforcement’s increasing cooperation with each other internationally has quickly ended Do Kwon’s run.3. Over the Great Crypto FirewallChinese state banks are warming to Hong Kong crypto businesses following the apparent blessing Beijing gave to the city’s plans to become a digital asset hub. Image: CanvaA number of Chinese state-owned banks’ Hong Kong branches have started offering services to local cryptocurrency companies, according to a Bloomberg report, as the city welcomes a growing list of cryptocurrency and digital asset firms looking to expand or relocate there.The Hong Kong entities of Bank of Communications, Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank have begun to offer services to local crypto firms or have made inquiries about doing so, according to the report.Companies in Hong Kong’s crypto industry frequently had difficulty setting up corporate bank accounts, and the moves by the state-owned lenders reflect China’s backing of the city’s digital asset industry, the report said.In September 2021, China banned cryptocurrency transactions within mainland Chinese borders, but Hong Kong has continued to be the home base for many companies in the sector. Last October, Hong Kong released policy documents embracing the sector, aiming to regain its position as an international hub for digital assets and Web3 companies.More than 80 foreign and mainland Chinese companies have expressed interest in establishing operations in Hong Kong, ahead of new crypto regulations that will take effect in June, Christopher Hui, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said last week.Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said last month that the government was setting aside HK$50 million (US$6.37 million) to develop the sector, which he called a “golden opportunity” to lead innovative development.Meanwhile, in mainland China, the legal status of cryptocurrencies is still under discussion, despite the country’s ban on crypto trading. The Chinese Procurators, a state-run legal magazine, published an opinion piece on March 20 advocating that cryptocurrencies should be identified as property under the country’s criminal law and thus protected from infringements.Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?Crypto’s speculative nature and enormous energy consumption — not to mention its ability to move large amounts of money outside of government control and monitoring —  made China sufficiently nervous to ban all crypto mining and crypto transactions in September 2021. However, Chinese authorities now appear to see the upside of crypto development, with Hong Kong publishing a series of policy documents to oversee the growth of the crypto sector in the city.Now that Chinese state-owned banks are voicing support for a growing number of crypto firms in need of corporate bank accounts, startups in the city may gain easier access to banking services. The Chinese banks’ moves could fill the void left by the collapses of crypto-friendly U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.Chinese officials, including representatives from China’s Hong Kong Liaison Office — Beijing’s representative outpost in the city — have been spotted mingling with local crypto industry figures at events in Hong Kong, Bloomberg reported last month, another sign that Beijing has given its blessing to Hong Kong’s crypto push.It’s becoming increasingly clear that China intends to develop its Web 3.0 industry, deploying all kinds of enterprise blockchain and government infrastructure projects while confining all things crypto to Hong Kong, a special administrative region that runs its own economy according to free market principles. As Hong Kong’s new licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms comes into effect later this year, the city may find itself in the enviable position of returning to its former glory as a crypto hub while underscoring assurances to investors and company founders that Hong Kong’s political overlords will not interfere.",0.5,-0.8,-0.8,-0.8
"Thanks to XRP, altcoins have started displacing Bitcoin","       Altcoin volume dominance across exchanges climbed to a four-month high. With increased profit-taking underway, XRP saw a decline in accumulation.  Investors have shifted their attention away from Bitcoin [BTC] following the Ripple ruling, sending altcoin volume dominance to a four-month high, research firm Kaiko noted in a new report.  Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2023-24  On 13 July, Judge Analisa Torress, through her ruling, put to rest the debate on whether Ripple’s sale of its XRP tokens in 2022 amounted to the sale of an “unregistered security.” Across all top cryptocurrency exchanges, Kaiko found that,       “BTC volume dominance has slipped 8% since the start of July following the Ripple ruling, which instantly caused altcoin markets to rally.” On the top 25 centralized exchanges, the leading coin’s volume dominance was less than 30%, marking its lowest level since April.  Source: Kaiko Kaiko further noted that there has been an uptick in altcoin trading on offshore exchanges to the detriment of BTC. The report stated: “Offshore exchanges have experienced a more extreme drop in BTC trading activity, partially due to a spike in South Korean altcoin volume. Since the start of 2023, BTC dominance has fallen by 20%.” Similarly, on U.S-based crypto exchanges, altcoins have seen increased trading activity. According to Kaiko, this suggested that  “Regulatory crackdown has not yet dampened demand.” Source: Kaiko The shift in demand from BTC toward altcoins was also confirmed in James Butterfill’s latest report on last week’s flows into digital asset investment products. According to the research analyst, while BTC experienced outflows of $13 million last week, leading alt Ethereum [ETH] and other alts such as XRP, Solana [SOL], Uniswap [UNI], and Polygon [MATIC] all posted inflows.  Regarding available liquidity in the altcoin market, Kaiko found that there has been a slight uptick in altcoin liquidity since the beginning of July.  “Since the start of July, 1% market depth for the top 10 altcoins by market cap has increased by ~$20mn.” Source: Kaiko All good things must come to an end An assessment of XRP’s on-chain activity revealed that the price uptick in the past few weeks might be nearing its end. At press time, XRP exchanged hands at $0.6877, with a 7% drop in value in the last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  How much are 1,10,100 XRPs worth today?  The price decline is attributable to a shortfall in new demand and the count of daily active addresses that have traded the token in the last week. According to data from Santiment, XRP’s daily active addresses peaked at a high of 29,937 on 19 July and have since declined by 17%. Likewise, the count of new addresses created to trade the altcoin has dwindled in the last week. Per Santiment, this has since seen a 46% drop. Source:Santiment While some accumulation occurred on a daily chart, buying pressure had begun to lose momentum. This suggested that traders have taken to distributing their XRP holdings to log profits.  With an MVRV of 86% at press time, holders would be at an average loss of approximately 14% if they were to sell their XRP tokens at the current price. This means that the press time market value is 86% of the average price at which the tokens were acquired, resulting in a negative profit.

"The Wall Street Journal on the decade since the crash: inequality, giant banks, regulatory failures, looming catastrophe","It's been ten years since the financial crisis, when barely regulated banks destroyed the world's economy, kicked off wars, and directly and indirectly killed millions.  The Wall Street Journal is a curious beast; its news stories tend to be firmly reality-grounded (because investors don't get a return on ideology, and reality has a well-know left-wing bias), while its editorial page has grown steadily more troglodyte since Rupert Murdoch bought the paper.  The WSJ's retrospective of the decade since the crash is much more in the reality-based news than the ideology-driven editorial section, despite a lot of editorializing.   In a series of snappy graphics and pithy text-blocks the Journal's writers hit all the high points:  * Markets are peaking  * Bankers are getting paid more than ever      * Unlike everyone else, whose wages suck  * We're more unequal than ever  * The bank bailouts pissed off everyone except bankers  * The banks got bigger and are now way, way too big to fail  * The finance sector continues to eclipse the economically useful parts of the economy  * Regulators are inevitably former execs in the industries they're regulating  * Bond-rating firms are dirty af  * Even more US mortgages are underwritten by the US government  * We're in the midst of a new round of asset-bubbles (see e.g. Bitcoin)  * Companies are amassing ever-larger silos of sensitive data and leaking it like crazy  * Student debt is hitting crisis levels and could spark the next crash  * Index funds now dwarf stocks, and are creating systemic risk  * More people rent than ever, and chances are their landlords are rapacious private equity funds  * Consumer debt is up  * The financial sector is increasingly based on the kind of ""complex"" (e.g. bullshytte) instruments that led to the 2008 crash  * The next crisis will be way worse: the US government can't borrow the way it did in 2008, and there's no more room to cut interest rates  What could possibly go wrong?   The financial crisis and the massive federal response reshaped the world we live in. Though the economy is in one of its longest expansions and stock indexes have hit new highs, many people across the political spectrum complain that the recovery is uneven and the markets' gains aren't fairly distributed. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at some of the most eventful aspects of the response and how we got to where we are today.   10 Years After the Crisis [Cezary Podkul.

In line with this, Tether will destroy 500m USDT from the Tether treasury wallet and will leave the remaining USDT (approx 466m) in the wallet as a preparatory measure for future USDT issuances. Conceptually, the Tether issuance and redemption process is outlined in the Tether white paper, with issuances and redemptions visible through observing the Tether treasury balance on the OMNI blockchain. Is Tether Losing Ground to Regulated Stablecoins? On October 9th, Tether had a total market cap of $2.8 billion and over the course of the month, the stablecoin, which was once the primary dollar pegged asset used by traders has seen its total market valuation drop below $2 billion as new regulated stablecoins are launching almost daily.  To date, the stablecoin has dropped 29% and the asset dropped even further when Coinbase announced plans to listed USDC earlier this week. It’s pretty clear that many traders are redeeming USDT for USD or purchasing other stablecoins which are not mired in controversy.  In total, Tether has pulled 800 million USDT from circulation and after today’s action, the Tether treasury contains roughly 467 million USDT. Do you think Tether is thinning its coin count as an attempt to re-peg with the U.S. Dollar?

5 Common Ways to Lose Your Bitcoins (And How to Stop It),"While the Bitcoin network is secure, things like poor safekeeping methods, malware, and user error can part people from their hard-earned coins. Here are five things to watch out for as you navigate the confusing cryptocurrency waters.   Are your coins safe? Coins can be lost in a variety of ways, with most people losing coins simply due to user error. This is a very real issue, as using many cryptocurrencies is way too hard for tech-illiterate people. There are quite a few opportunities for mistakes and some could result in you losing everything.                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609691 = window.pid609691 || rnd;                 var plc609691 = window.plc609691 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609691;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609691 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609691++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc367529 = window.plc367529 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc367529:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_367529_' + plc367529;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 367529,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_367529_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc367529++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                  Storing Funds on Exchanges Thousands of cryptocurrency users keep their holdings on exchanges for convenience or lack of knowledge about private wallets, i.e. wallets that enable only you to control the private keys. Hardware wallets like the Trezor have a great reputation in this space and are known for good customer services. Other mobile wallet apps like Samourai and Edge also never have access to your private keys and give users full control. Exchanges are honeypots for hackers looking to make a quick buck. If you use a lesser known exchange or an exchange that may not have proper security, your coins could be at risk. Just in the past month, two exchanges, Coincheck and Bithumb, have been hacked totaling in well over $450 million in cryptocurrencies stolen. Make sure you keep your coins in a private wallet, or at the very least a reputable exchange. Also, make sure you don’t get phished. Always double check the domain you’re visiting and use bookmarks. Most importantly, don’t visit your exchange by clicking random links online!                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609692 = window.pid609692 || rnd;                 var plc609692 = window.plc609692 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609692;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609692 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609692++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                                     if (!window.AdButler) {                     (function () {                         var s = document.createElement('script');                         s.async = true;                         s.type = 'text/javascript';                         s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';                         var n = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];                         n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);                     })();                 }                                var AdButler = AdButler || {};                 AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var plc476001 = window.plc476001 || 0;                 (function () {                     var divs = document.querySelectorAll(                         '.plc476001:not([id])'                     );                     var div = divs[divs.length - 1];                     div.id = 'placement_476001_' + plc476001;                     AdButler.ads.push({                         handler: function (opt) {                             AdButler.register(                                 172179,                                 476001,                                 [728, 90],                                 'placement_476001_' + opt.place,                                 opt                             );                         },                         opt: {                             place: plc476001++,                             keywords: abkw,                             domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com',                             click: 'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER',                         },                     });                 })();                                     var rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random() * 10e6);                 var pid609693 = window.pid609693 || rnd;                 var plc609693 = window.plc609693 || 0;                 var abkw = window.abkw || '';                 var absrc =                     'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=172179;size=0x0;setID=609693;type=js;sw=' +                     screen.width +                     ';sh=' +                     screen.height +                     ';spr=' +                     window.devicePixelRatio +                     ';kw=' +                     abkw +                     ';pid=' +                     pid609693 +                     ';place=' +                     plc609693++ +                     ';rnd=' +                     rnd +                     ';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER';                 document.write(                     ''                 );                  How to prevent loss: Keep your coins in a wallet where you control the private keys.

However, too many of these token sales end up as scams. ICO organizers will promote their ICO to as many people as possible as investors pour more valuable cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, into the founder’s pockets. Bitcoinist also reported that more than 80% of tokens have traded below ICO price since 2017. Moreover, many of these projects have questionable motives, tend to overpromise and underdeliver, and do not even need a blockchain. So unless you love the risk, nine times out of ten, it will be safer to stick with the more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin than some novel coin whose founders spent millions on marketing. How to prevent loss: Research the team and the project before investing in any project including past projects they’ve been a part of. ‘Free ETH Giveaways!’ These have become so common that even people with under 3,000 followers now have impersonators. Fake accounts aim to impersonate public figures in the community, announcing a brand-new giveaway. All you need to do to enter is send a bit of ether to an address, and you’ll get ten times that back! As the saying goes; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. How to prevent loss: Don’t send money to strangers on the internet (duh).  https://t.co/beDM05c9F5 https://t.co/As3jOkfpAV — Vitalik ""Not giving away ETH"" Buteriп (@RheaVaughan19) June 27, 2018  Sending to the wrong address Bitcoin transactions are completely irreversible, unlike traditional financial systems. Sending a transaction to the wrong address could mean they’re gone forever, unless the owner of the address is kind enough to send them back to you. Some malware will paste a hack’s address even when you’ve copied a legitimate address. Even worse, sending them to an address that no one owns means they’re lost to the void, never to be spent again. How to prevent loss: Before you go to send a transaction, triple check that the address you’re trying to send the coins to matches the one pasted in your wallet. Verify everything is correct before you hit send. Losing your private keys Your private keys are what gives you ownership of your coins and losing them could mean they’re lost forever. There are numerous stories online about people throwing out old hard drives with hundreds of bitcoins on them that are now worth fortunes. Don’t be one of the people during the next bull run wishing they hadn’t thrown out that old laptop! How to prevent loss: Create working backups of all wallets and test the recovery phrases to make sure they work. Keep your seed on a physical medium, such as a piece of paper, and store it in a safe place.  Scared Yet? Don’t be! A bit of personal due diligence makes the chance of these scams almost zero. Before you invest in a project or send coins to an exchange, read reviews from other investors/users. See if they have a reputable history and if anyone has been scammed before. Only use businesses that have a long-standing presence in the community. Whenever you store coins on a personal wallet, make sure it’s properly backed up in the event of your device gets lost or breaks down. And finally, for the love of Satoshi, don’t send Ether to people on Twitter. Have you ever lost cryptocurrencies in any of these ways? How do you protect your holdings?

FTX says $415M in crypto was hacked since it filed for bankruptcy,"The company provided additional details on Tuesday, saying it had recovered $1.7 billion in cash, $3.5 billion in liquid cryptocurrency and $300 million in liquid securities. FTX did not provide an estimate of total liabilities, but said it had identified important significant shortfalls at both its international and US crypto exchanges.  Catch up on The Post’s latest in the Sam Bankman-Fried FTX scandal SBF arrives at parents’ house under cover of night for confinementLawyers explain why SBF has ‘no easy path’ forward after ex-lover’s possible flipThis is where Sam Bankman-Fried will be under house arrest after $250M bail  “We are making progress in our efforts to maximize recoveries, and it has taken a Herculean investigative effort from our team to uncover this preliminary information,” Ray said in the statement. The crypto assets recovered to date include $685 million in Solana, $529 million in FTX’s proprietary FTT token and $268 million in bitcoin, based on crypto prices on Nov. 11, 2022. Solana, which was lauded by Bankman-Fried, lost most of its value in 2022. During FTX’s initial investigation into hacks of its system, it uncovered a November asset seizure by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, which led to a dispute between FTX’s US-based bankruptcy team and Bahamian regulators.  The two sides settled their differences in January, and Ray said on Tuesday that the Bahamian government was holding $426 million for creditors. Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis referenced the dispute during a Tuesday event at the Atlantic Council in Washington, saying that Ray’s team had “come around” and accepted that the Bahamian asset seizure “was appropriate and perhaps has saved the day for many of the investors in FTX.”  ",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Oxfam prostitution scandal widens to at least three countries,"The executive director of Oxfam International said she was “heartbroken” by an unfolding sexual misconduct scandal linked to aid workers in Haiti. (Video: Reuters)ShareAdd to your saved storiesSaveA confidence crisis spread through the international aid community Tuesday amid accusations that the charity Oxfam had buried reports that its workers had prostituted survivors of the Darfur genocide, a catastrophic earthquake in Haiti and possibly disasters beyond those.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightHaitian President Jovenel Moïse condemned those involved in the scandal, saying on Twitter that “there is nothing more outrageous and dishonest than a sexual predator who uses his position as part of the humanitarian response to a natural disaster to exploit needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability.”Il n'y a rien de plus indigne et malhonnête qu'un prédateur sexuel qui utilise sa position dans le cadre de la réponse humanitaire à une catastrophe naturelle pour exploiter les personnes nécessiteuses dans leurs moments de grande vulnérabilité.— Président Jovenel Moïse (@moisejovenel) February 13, 2018  His words echoed those of a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May, who this week condemned the “horrific behavior” within Oxfam, as her government opened an official inquiry into the charity and a top executive resigned in shame.AdvertisementBut the scandal may not stay limited to Oxfam. The Guardian reported that British politicians are demanding an investigation “across the wider aid sector,” as new reports claim that vulnerable women were prostituted across multiple charities and countries, and that warnings went ignored for much of the 21st century.Many of the allegations center on one man: Roland van Hauwermeiren, who led Oxfam's relief efforts in Chad in the mid-2000s, when a genocidal war in neighboring Sudan sent refugees and violence spilling across the border.“Things are very, very desperate and are only likely to get worse. People are suffering; they are drinking dirty water and have nothing to eat,” van Hauwermeiren said in late 2006 in an Oxfam news release.Citing a former aid worker, the Guardian reported Saturday that prostitutes were repeatedly invited to Oxfam's living quarters in Chad and that van Hauwermeiren was aware of the activity, if not also involved in it. Oxfam has since admitted that it knew about the allegations, but it continued to put van Hauwermeiren in charge of humanitarian missions.AdvertisementA year later, the news agency IRIN reported, he served as the spokesman for a coalition of nonprofit agencies working in Chad — including Oxfam, Save the Children and Action Against Hunger. The community had been scandalized at the time by the arrest of six workers from a French-based aid group, Zoé's Ark, who were later convicted of trying to abduct dozens of children from Chad.At the time, van Hauwermeiren urged the world not to lose confidence in the global aid community. “We continue delivering services as ever before,” he told IRIN. “The population is smart enough to make differences.”As an Oxfam country director, van Hauwermeiren went on to lead missions in Congo and then in Haiti after a deadly earthquake destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and society in 2010.About a year later, in late 2011, Oxfam cryptically announced that six workers had left the organization after an internal investigation revealed unspecified “misconduct” in Haiti — including “abuse of power and bullying” that brought the charity's “name into disrepute.”AdvertisementVan Hauwermeiren also had resigned, the statement read, taking “managerial responsibility” for the misconduct, whatever it was.Nearly seven years later, on Thursday, a report in the Times of London revealed that Oxfam's investigation had turned up much more than bullying in Haiti.The Times reported that van Hauwermeiren and several male workers — a small fraction of the more than 200 Oxfam workers in Haiti — had been accused of turning their guesthouse into what they allegedly called “the whorehouse.”Share this articleShare“These girls wearing Oxfam T-shirts, running around half-naked, it was like a full-on 'Caligula' orgy,” a source told the paper.After the report ran, Haiti's ambassador to Britain told the Guardian that the victims “may have been underage kids.” The Times alleged that Oxfam deliberately limited its investigation in the hope of hiding the scandal.AdvertisementOxfam has since admitted to knowing about the prostitution allegations involving the Haiti and Chad missions. The charity's deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, resigned on Monday. She was the program director at the time of the alleged wrongdoings. “I am ashamed that this happened on my watch and I take full responsibility,” Lawrence wrote in a statement.The charity's chief executive, Mark Goldring, has denied a coverup attempt and defended Oxfam's misleading 2011 statements.“With hindsight, I would much prefer that we had talked about sexual misconduct, but I don’t think it was in anyone’s best interest to be describing the details of the behavior in a way that was actually going to draw extreme attention to it,” he told BBC Radio 4 on Saturday, according to the Guardian.The scandal keeps widening, with new reports of sex abuse involving charities other than Oxfam.AdvertisementBefore van Hauwermeiren joined Oxfam, IRIN reported Tuesday, he directed relief efforts for a charity that has since merged with Save the Children.Van Hauwermeiren was accused of arranging sex parties in Liberia after its civil war in the early 2000s, IRIN wrote, and was sent home after an internal investigation.“Oh, my God, he’s been doing this for 14 years,” a former aid worker who complained about his behavior at the time told the news service. “He just goes around the system … from Liberia to Chad, to Haiti, to Bangladesh,” she said, referring to reports that van Hauwermeiren continued to work in the aid sector with yet another nonprofit organization, Action Against Hunger, after he resigned from Oxfam.Nor did Oxfam's problems end with van Hauwermeiren's departure, according to new reports. A former Oxfam investigator told reporters this week that “a culture of sexual abuse” festered in the organization at least until 2015, according to Reuters. The investigator said reports of a woman coerced into prostituting herself for aid went unheeded by executives, as did allegations of abuse at a charity shop in Britain.AdvertisementResponding to the new allegations, Reuters wrote, Oxfam expressed “regret that we did not act on [them] much quicker and with more resources.”This is by no means the first scandal in the global aid community, which some say is rife with sexual exploitation. Dozens of U.N. peacekeepers were accused of abusing civilians last year, for example, according to Al Jazeera.But Oxfam — with about half a billion dollars in annual income from public and private sources — had been renowned worldwide for it relief efforts. It was also a vocal critic of government missteps, such as when the charity called out the Trump administration's “inadequate” response to last year's hurricane in Puerto Rico.So its fall in stature has created an upheaval, with world leaders condemning Oxfam's failure and the British government considering whether to defund it.“If the moral leadership at the top of the organization isn't there, then we can't have you as a partner,” Penny Mordaunt, Britain's secretary of international development, told the BBC in reference to Oxfam.Read more: Nuclear scientists logged on to one of Russia’s most-secure computers — to mine bitcoinA witness drew this terrible sketch to help police identify a suspect.

"Recall of 300,000+ Wireless Earphones Due to Fire and Burn Injuries","By B.N. Frank Wireless wearables (activity trackers/watches, earphones, hearing aids, rings, Virtual Reality (VR) goggles, etc.) operate via biologically harmful wireless frequencies (aka “Wi-Fi”) and expose wearers to biologically harmful radiation.  They have been associated with  Cyberattacks Fires, explosions, overheating (see 1, 2) Health complaints (rashes, electric shock, other undesirable symptoms) (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Health monitoring / Invasion of Privacy (see 1, 2, 3, 4) High Levels of Harmful Electromagnetic Radiation Interference with medical implants (cardio defibrillators, pacemakers, etc.) (see 1, 2)  Nevertheless, companies keep making and marketing them because they legally can.  Now additional wireless wearables are being recalled due to fire and burn injuries. From MSN:       Wireless Earphone Users Report Fire and Burn Injuries, Prompting Recall of Over 300K Units A specific brand of wireless earphones has been recalled due to safety concerns that can arise when the earphones overheat, product safety officials said this week. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), an independent agency with the federal government based in Maryland, issued a press release announcing the recall on Wednesday. The recall covers more than 300,000 of the Jobsite Pro Wireless Earphones by DEWALT. According to the CPSC’s release, the earphones can run the risk of overheating while they are either charging or in use. In some cases, the earphones can pose “burn and fire hazards” when they are overheated, the CPSC’s release said. #Recall: About 300,000 E-filliate DEWALT Jobsite Pro Wireless Earphones can overheat while charging or in use, posing burn and fire hazards. Get replacement. CONTACT: 888-979-4439, DW2091@efilliate.com, or https://t.co/WVp8e1Abnp. Full recall notice: https://t.co/1UX0kjm7pZ pic.twitter.com/cEHPeoSGDM — US Consumer Product Safety Commission (@USCPSC) December 1, 2021 E-Filliate, Inc., a consumer electronics company, initiated the recall after receiving 61 reports of the products overheating, according to CPSC. Among those were “five reports of fire and four reports of minor burn injuries,” the CPSC said. E-Filliate said on its website that it launched the recall “to keep our customers safe and prevent injuries by removing the problem products.” The earphones covered by the recall were described as having “a black and yellow neckband with wired earbuds” and were sold in packaging that includes mention of the “DEWALT” brand and the specific product name. All of the earphones have a manufacturing number printed on the left side of the neckband. Any earphones with the following codes are covered by the recall, according to E-Filliate: D4 1910, D4 1912, D4 2003, D4 2004, D4 2006, D4 2009, D4 2011, D4 2012, D4 2101, D4 2103, and D4 2104. Earphones without any printed manufacturing code on the neckband are also covered by the recall, E-Filliate said. The recall covers an estimated 301,800 sets of earphones.     The earphones were sold between December 2019 and July of this year for an estimated $60 at The Home Depot, Lowe’s and other electronic and hardware stores across the U.S., as well as online at cyberguys.com, according to the CPSC. Individuals who believe they are in possession of a set of the recalled earphones were instructed to stop using them “immediately,” regardless of whether they have personally experienced an issue with the product. Those who have the product were encouraged to contact E-Filliate by phone or email to get a pre-paid return label, which can be sent to the consumers by mail or email. The consumers can then use the return labels to send the earphones back to E-Filliate and receive a replacement set. No receipt is necessary in order to return the earphones, E-Filliate said. Newsweek reached out to DEWALT for comment.

"Optimism: DeFi protocol succumbs to hack, how was OP impacted","– DeFi protocol on Optimism, called Hundred Finance, was hacked with $7 million worth of funds stolen. – The sentiment against the protocol declined, however activity on Optimism remained high. Hundred Finance, a lending and borrowing DeFi protocol on the Optimism [OP] network, was attacked by a hacker on 15 April. The hack led to the exploitation of $7 million worth of assets.  Realistic or not, here’s OP’s market cap in BTC’s terms       Taking millions from Hundred According to data provided by PeckShield Inc, a blockchain security firm, the hacker’s strategy was to donate a large amount of Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] to manipulate the price of another cryptocurrency called Hundred Finance Wrapped Bitcoin [hWBTC]. By inflating the exchange rate of hWBTC, the hacker was able to take advantage of a vulnerability on the platform and drain its lending pools by withdrawing a tiny amount of hWBTC. This resulted in significant losses for Hundred Finance and its users. Hundred Finance has been using Twitter to keep its users informed about the recent attack on their platform. In their latest tweet on 16 April, they mentioned that they are attempting to open a dialogue with the hacker in order to come to an agreement.  We advise not to speculate on how the attack was executed, team is preparing a post mortem.  Main focus is establish coms with hacker, reach an agreement.  In parallel we are gathering all information available in order to have that handy for possible further steps.  Thank you — Hundred Finance (@HundredFinance) April 16, 2023  These attacks caused a severe impact on the state of the Hundred Finance protocol. According to data from Dapp Radar, volume and overall transactions on the network have declined. Source: Dapp Radar Caught in the crossfire The dApp hack has the potential to affect people’s opinions of the network it operates on. Data from Santiment showed that over the past few days, there has been a decrease in positive sentiment toward the Optimism protocol. This indicates that the general outlook of the crypto community towards Optimism turned more skeptical. Source: Santiment However, the negative sentiment around Optimism didn’t affect the protocol’s health. According to Token Terminal’s data, the daily activity on the protocol continued to surge over the last few days. Moreover, the fees collected by the protocol also increased by 29% in the last week. Source: Token Terminal OP seems to be okay OP experienced a significant price increase of 21.78% since 12 April. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for OP is currently at 64.32, which suggests that it is in a slightly overbought territory.  Is your portfolio green? Check out the Optimism Profit Calculator  Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator for the token surged from -0.03 to 0.06 in the last few days. This indicator implies that the demand for OP has recently gone up, resulting in increased buying pressure. These factors point towards a positive trend for OP, with rising buying pressure leading to a hike in its price.

"Bitcoin - Still Needs To Close The Open Gap At $8,500","Bitcoin (BTC-USD) had a spectacular rally between April and June. Since the top at US$13,880 it has pulled back sharply, recovered and is now trading below US$10,000 again. As things look now, the open gap in Bitcoin Futures at around US$8,500 still needs to be closed. Sentiment is already beaten down and could be ready for a surprising rally if Bitcoin drops another US$1,000. Review Since my last analysis from July 12, 2019, Bitcoin has continued its correction as expected. Back then, I called a potential target zone between US$7,000 and US$9,000. This zone was almost reached on July 17, with the lows at US$9,050. After prices rebounded from the broad support zone between US$8,600 to US$9,100 with a low of US$9,111 on July 28, market participants took more courage again. Within less than two weeks of trading, prices jumped up significantly and reached US$12,325 on August 6 almost within sight of the annual high at US$13,880. However, over the past ten days, Bitcoin prices have slipped south again and are currently trading at US$10,000. Overall, a broad-based consolidation at high levels and a flat downward trend channel have emerged in the last one and a half months. So far, there is a series of lower highs, while at the same time volatility has retreated due to the summer trading season. Considering the sharp and impressive rally from movement US$3,125 to US$13,880 (+ 344%), the current correction remains modest and healthy with the maximum pullback being 34.8% so far. Technical Analysis For Bitcoin Bitcoin in US-Dollar, weekly chart as of August 15th, 2019. Source: Tradingview On the weekly chart, the overall extremely bullish setup is obvious. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has risen from US$0.008 to nearly US$20,000 in just under 10 years, far outperforming all other asset classes. It is very likely that this unique performance will continue in the coming years. In the next two months, however, new all-time highs are not foreseeable. Rather, Bitcoin is in a consolidation at high levels, which seems not yet completed. It is therefore more likely that prices will continue to bounce back and forth with a tough and confusing sideways movement. With Bitcoin futures having an open gap at US$8,500, a new low within the current correction cycle is also conceivable. However, prices below US$6,500, are extremely unlikely.  Bitcoin in US-Dollar, daily chart as of August 15th, 2019. Source: Tradingview The daily chart captures the price movements of the last three and a half months. Since the high of US$13,887, a series of lower highs has been established, while at the bottom, the support zone between US$8,600 and US$9,100 has been tested only once. With the recent sell-signal from the Stochastic Oscillator, Bitcoin has now fallen back within the relatively shallow downtrend channel below US$10,000. As this psychological number has not stop the sell-off, the open gap in the Bitcoin Futures is likely to attract prices at around US$8,500 US dollars. Depending on how long the consolidation process will take, the 200-day-moving-average (US$7,042) could rise towards this price area until end of September. A closed gap and a successful test of the 200-day-line as well as a strongly oversold situation could then form the ideal foundation for a explosive rally in the 4th quarter 2019. Overall, the daily chart lacks any bullish evidence and provides more warning signals than contrarian opportunities. I recommend a wait-and-see attitude. Commitments of Traders Report For Bitcoin Commitment of Traders for Bitcoin as of August 9th, 2019 Source: Barchart As mentioned before, Bitcoin has a relatively small set of data available, since bitcoin futures contracts have only been trading since December 2017. Based on the weekly COT report, a rather atypical picture emerges so far, because the commercial hedgers, which are usually known as contra-indicators and ""smart money"", are not (yet) particularly active in the bitcoin futures market. This is most likely due to the fact that there are still not many products that can or need to be hedged via the derivatives markets. In addition, most ""market makers"" are different crypto exchanges that are spread all over the planet and can also hedge against client positions via their own platform. However, it is remarkable that the small speculators (i.e reportable private traders or traders) have continued to expand their pro-cyclical long positions between spring to mid-July, while the large speculators (big hedge funds) have taken the other side and are clearly short on Bitcoin. Most interesting though is the positioning of the ""Other Reportables"". This group is not listed individually in the normal COT report and represents all reportable traders who can not be assigned to one of the three groups of producers, swap dealers or money managers. In retrospect and from a countercyclical point of view, this group has played the bitcoin market almost perfectly as they were heavily on the long side at the starting point of the Bitcoin Rally in April. Over the last few months however, the ""Other Reportables"" have moved further and further to the short side. Since the high in July, they have gradually covered their shorts. It will be interesting to see, how much of their shorts have been covered with Bitcoin now trading below US$10,000 again. Once this group has a solid long position again it is time to join the long bitcoin trade! If one follows the group of the ""Other Reportables"" the correction will have to go continue in the coming weeks until Bitcoin will find a new and final low in the autumn. Sentiment Bitcoin Bitcoin Optix as of August 14th, 2019. Source: Sentimentrader According to data from Sentimentrader, sentiment for Bitcoin peaked on August 5 at US$11,800. Since then, the correction has already pushed the mood among market participants towards growing pessimism. Overall, it doesn't take much more beating until the Bitcoin Optix will move to a contrarian buy signal. Source: Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index  Source: Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index Similar results are currently being provided by the far more in-depth ""Fear &amp; Greed Index"", although no pronounced sentiment highs have been measured by the index in early August. Rather, the last sentiment high was well below the euphoria high of late June. Interestingly enough, the ""Fear &amp; Greed Index"" has now plunged nearly as deep as in last December when the crypto winter reached its final lows. The downward pressure has obviously surprised many market participants during the last few days. In summary, the sentiment analysis does not yet provide a buy signal. Neither of course is the euphoria among the investors so extreme, that one would have to bring himself and his investments to safety, nor is there a blind panic and blood in the street, which one should use to buy with both hands. However, in the short term, due to the price decline of the last few days the mood has fallen surprisingly deep into pessimistic levels. Seasonality Bitcoin Seasonality for Bitcoin as of August 11th, 2019. Source: Seasonax Even though an evaluation period of only 10 years for Bitcoin is rather short, there is a certainly a clear picture regarding the typical seasonal price pattern. Due to the exorbitantly large price swings, however, this pattern can change significantly within just one year! In the current year, Bitcoin has so far followed its seasonal cycle quite well. Accordingly, the correction could continue until the end of September or mid-October, while the fourth quarter should bring significantly rising prices! Generally, we are in the middle of summer doldrums. Many traders are on vacation and like to take a break after the massive rally in the second quarter. Lower volume and falling volatility did confirm this. In summary, the seasonality currently provides no reason to be fully invested in the crypto market. Bitcoin against gold Bitcoin in Gold as of August 11th, 2019. Source: XE Currently, a Bitcoin costs just under 6.5 ounces of gold. In other words, for one ounce of gold, you currently have to pay 0.152 Bitcoin! As a result, gold has become about 26% more expensive against Bitcoin in the last four weeks. Although the gold price is currently heavily overbought, for the immediate future the trend could continue in favor of gold. An exchange of bitcoin into gold is not advised at current levels anymore. Basically, one should be invested in both asset classes. The recommended allocation in precious metals (primarily physical) should be at least 10% and a maximum of 25% of oneâs total assets. In cryptos and especially in Bitcoin investors should hold at least 1% and a maximum of 5%. If you are very familiar with crypto currencies and Bitcoin, you can individually allocate higher percentages in Bitcoin. For the normal investor, who of course is invested mainly in equities and real estate, holding 5% in the highly speculative and highly volatile Bitcoin is already quite a lot! Conclusion and recommendation The situation in Bitcoin has obviously reversed over the last one and a half months. The correction brought an end to the euphoria with a healthy but still manageable pullback. However, these sideways and consolidation phases are anything but easy to handle. On top of that, the low summer trading season is causing nerve-racking moves in Bitcoin, as the crypto currency jumps up and down with price swings of US$500 without a sustainable and prevailing trend. Only in the last days the bears were able to achieve significant progress. In the larger picture, lower prices seem still likely in the weeks ahead. Should Bitcoin close its open gap at US$8,500, aggressive long positions are recommended. On the other hand, if the last two highs at US$12,300 and US$13,200 can be taken out, a new wave up with a first target at US$20,000 should already have started.  For the time being, a wait-and-see attitude at the sidelines is recommended.",-0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5
Why US tech controls on China could end up hurting American semiconductors - Yahoo Canada Finance,"When the US first banned sales of certain tech products to Chinese tech firm Huawei three years ago, it crippled a once-proud national champion and sent ripples across the US semiconductor industry. In the quarters following that export ban in May 2019, top American chipmakers reported a median revenue decline of 4% to 9%.The Biden administration’s latest tech controls threaten to accelerate those losses, throwing the global semiconductor sector into disarray. And Chinese companies targeted by the new regulations won’t be the only ones feeling the pain.“If China really wants to be as aggressive as the US and retaliate, there could be a lot of impact for other companies in the US,” said Edith Yeung, Race Capital General Partner, in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “This is beyond impact on revenue for Intel (INTC) or Qualcomm (QCOM) or NVIDIA (NVDA).”The US has long been a global leader in semiconductors, commanding roughly 45% to 50% market share. However, that leadership has been built on global demand for its products, with China consuming roughly 75% of semiconductors sold globally.Chinese device makers alone accounted for roughly a quarter of global semiconductor demand in 2018, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).'More than just a preventative tool'That innovation cycle is at risk of being picked apart, with the Biden administration’s sweeping tech controls, aimed at freezing China’s semiconductor development and dramatically limiting critical technology exports from the US“Technology export controls can be more than just a preventative tool,” said National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, ahead of the administration’s announcements. “If implemented in a way that is robust, durable, and comprehensive, they can be a new strategic asset in the US and allied toolkit to impose costs on adversaries, and even over time degrade their battlefield capabilities.”US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is seen on a monitor while speaking during a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden, CEOs, and labor leaders, not pictured, regarding the Chips Act, in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House, in Washington, DC, on July 25, 2022. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)'A sea change' in policySpecifically, the new measures block sales of semiconductors critical to the development of artificial intelligence, supercomputers, and other advanced technologies, unless companies receive exemptions. It also expands an existing ban to sell advanced chip-making equipment to Chinese firms.Story continuesIn a broad escalation, the Biden administration’s actions also restrict US firms and citizens, including permanent residents, from supporting China’s development of advanced chips.The restrictions announced earlier this month have already created a chilling effect.At least 43 senior executives are American citizens working with 16 publicly listed Chinese semiconductor companies, according to the Wall Street Journal. Western firms like Dutch equipment maker ASML Holding NV have suspended American employees from working as a precaution, while they seek further clarity. What's more, Apple temporarily halted plans to use memory chips from China’s Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. in products, according to Nikkei Asia.“This is really a sea change in policy… the U.S. is imposing a freeze-in-place strategy toward China's indigenous chip development,” said Reva Goujon, Rhodium Group Director. “[The semiconductor sector] is an interdependent, interlocking ecosystem where all the parts kind of have to be in place for things to work to be able to upgrade to more and more advanced levels. So, if you cut the legs out from under that production cycle, you can really cause a lot of disruption, which is exactly what the US intent is.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken views products near Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson at Applied Materials, in Santa Clara, California, U.S. October 17, 2022. Josh Edelson/Pool via REUTERSImpact on US chipmakersThe disruption may not be limited to Chinese firms. A 2020 study by BCG estimated that US companies could lose 18% of their global market share and 37% of their revenues over the same period if the US completely bans semiconductor companies from selling to Chinese customers.The measures have already prompted chip equipment maker Applied Materials to cut fourth-quarter estimates for net sales by approximately $400 million.

I think this is about leading the arms race for the next generation of technology in areas like supercomputing, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence.”An employee works on the production line of semiconductor wafer at a factory of Jiangsu Azure Corporation Cuoda Group Co., Ltd. on September 27, 2022 in Huai'an, Jiangsu Province of China.

If companies there find a workaround for the Biden administration’s measures, Goujon said the new controls could end up backfiring on the US“Foreign competitors to US [equipment makers] have an opportunity here, of course, to try to capture more market share in China if they can displace US persons and US linkages, which is possible in some areas,” she said.“The US is applying heavy bilateral and plurilateral pressure for partners to follow its lead, and it's sending the signal that look, This package contains extraterritorial measures and we will add more if needed. But here's the window to try to basically align with our controls. So that's really going to be an important question now.”Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Nasdaq-Based Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange Shuts Down,"DX.Exchange, launched in January, utilized Nasdaq’s matching engine and financial information exchange to avoid the problem of double-spending and fake volumes that often plague cryptocurrency exchange desks, a digital assets publication CoinDesk reports.The cryptocurrency startup partnered with MPS Marketplace Securities to let its users own real-world stocks using tokens.According to its concept, the users would own the cryptocurrency, while MPS would own the actual stocks.

Google Stock Price Slumps Despite Upbeat Earnings Performance,"Google Stock Talking Points:Alphabet’s Google surpassed expectations with revenue and EPS comfortably above estimatesIncreased capital expenditures spooked investors and saw Google shares trade slightly lower Although the group delivered results above expectations, many of them came with warning signsSee Q1 2019 forecasts for the Dow, Dollar, Bitcoin and more with the  DailyFX Trading Guides.Google’s parent company Alphabet reported earnings after the market close Monday, surprising investors with results comfortably above expectations. Revenue for the fourth quarter read $31.84 versus the $31.28 billion expected. Not to be outdone, earnings per share recorded a beat of $1.91 at $12.77. Despite the great revenue and earnings performance, Google shares traded lower as analysts were disappointed by the firm’s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter.  Alphabet Earnings Impress (Chart 1)Apart from an 80% increase in spending from $3.84 billion in Q4 2017 to $6.85 billion in Q4 2018, the firm’s other attributes remained encouraging. Paid clicks on Google properties spiked 66% and Alphabet’s operating margin increased by 21% despite a 29% decrease in cost-per-click on Google properties. Still, the strong overall performance was not enough to overcome the considerable spike in capital expenditure and shares of Google slumped roughly 2% in after-hours trading.Google Stock Price (GOOG): (February 4, 2019) (Chart 2)Chart source: MarketwatchFAANG Remains on Top, But with a CaveatWith Alphabet’s earning release today, all five FAANG members have reported earnings for the quarter. Despite the brief correction experienced by the Dow Jones and S&P 500, the high-flying group of tech stocks offered robust quarterly performances nonetheless. All members, apart from Netflix, beat current-quarter revenue and EPS expectations. The group’s performance bodes well for overall equity market sentiment but warnings from Apple, Amazon and others cloud the picture. To start, Apple’s quarterly performance beat expectations only after guidance was lowered.  The announcement subsequently caused a USDJPY flash crash  and Apple’s stock price reacted similarly. Elsewhere, Amazon offered impressive results for the quarter  but disappointed on forecasts for the future.  The underwhelming projections saw Amazon shares trade lower despite the earnings beat. Outside of FAANG,  Caterpillar and Nvidia highlighted slowing economic growth in China  and the US-China trade war as reasons for their poor performances and cause for concern in the quarters to come.

Trump administration slaps more sanctions on North Korea,"""As North Korea continues to threaten international peace and security, we are steadfast in our determination to maximize economic pressure to isolate it from outside sources of trade and revenue while exposing its evasive tactics,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement.       In total, Tuesday's action targets one individual, 13 companies and 20 vessels that have engaged in trade worth hundreds of millions of dollars with North Korea.    Treasury said a number of persons targeted in the announcement operate in the North Korean transportation industry or import or export goods to the rogue state. North Korea is known to employ deceptive shipping practices, including ship-to-ship transfers, according to the Treasury Department.   Related: Trump gives 'final warning' on North Korea trade     Three Chinese trading companies exported roughly $650 million in goods to North Korea and imported more than $100 million. The products included notebook computers, coal and iron.   Another Chinese firm, Dandong Dongyuan Industrial, exported more than $28 million in motor vehicles, electrical machinery and other items associated with nuclear reactors to North Korea over several years. Dongyuan has also been associated with front companies for North Korean organizations known to develop weapons of mass destruction.   Another organization was designated for exporting workers from North Korea.   The latest move comes a day after Trump declared he was placing North Korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. President George W. Bush removed the rogue nation from the list in 2008.   North Korea is now one of only four countries in the world with that label. The others include Iran, Sudan and Syria.   President Trump has been steadfast in upholding his policy of exerting ""maximum pressure"" on North Korea to isolate the regime. Monday's announcement was seen by analysts as a diplomatic tool by the administration to heighten pressure on foreign countries to stop doing business with North Korea.   ""Anything you can do to add on to the narrative business with North Korea is not acceptable -- and certainly the state sponsor determination does that -- pushes it in the right direction to cut off their relationships,"" said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.   Such a designation, prevents North Korea from receiving U.S. foreign assistance and places a ban on defense exports and sales. The designation also allows the U.S. to punish people or countries who trade with it.    Related: North Korea still making millions from small arms exports    Under sanctions legislation signed by Trump in August, the State Department was required to report to Congress whether it would re-designate North Korea earlier this month. The agency had opted to delay the decision until after the president's trip to Asia.   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged the designation would bring a few new sanctions beyond those already imposed. But he noted the decision to add North Korea back to the list was ultimately a message to the regime about the U.S.'s resolve to ""disrupt and dissuade"" certain actors from doing business with North Korea.   The latest sanctions are expected to be one of several to be announced against North Korea in the coming weeks, Trump said on Monday. The series of actions would bring U.S. sanctions against Pyongyang to their highest level ever.   Already, the Treasury Department has designated eight North Korean banks and more than two dozen North Korean nationals working in countries like China, Russia and Libya.   The North Korean regime is believed to use a complex network of front companies to do business in China and other countries in order to dodge sanctions. The September order put the onus on banks and other firms to find out whether their clients have any dealings with North Korea.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest    In September, Trump signed an executive order that would penalize any company or person doing business with North Korea by either cutting off their access to the U.S. financial system or freezing their assets -- or potentially both.   Under the order, Trump gave Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Tillerson more power to slap sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear efforts. Mnuchin now has the ability to freeze assets of any individual or business that trades in goods, services or technology with Pyongyang.   Mnuchin said last week at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council he has no doubt sanctions work. ""In the case of Iran, the only reason they came to negotiate was this,"" he said.   ""We're going through a process where I think the sanctions are beginning to work [in North Korea] and we'll continue to put more on,"" he said.   --CNN's Dan Merica, Jeremy Diamond and Zachary Cohn contributed to this report.

Canada’s Quarantine Hotels Backfire As People Starved,"By Tyler Durden A couple of weeks ago, the Canadian government introduced a new set of rules forcing international air travelers to quarantine in hotels for three days upon arrival; the plan has since backfired, “after a series of endless, chaotic setbacks including food shortages and even alleged sexual assaults,” according to RT News.       Vancouver’s local radio station CKWX reports travelers have become upset at Sheraton Gateway Hotel in Toronto after they waited hours for their meals. Arunthia Urmi, who traveled outside of Canada to visit her father, said she waited hours for food, only to receive nothing more than a flimsy piece of salmon – barely a meal. She also said: “There was no water. There was no fork or knife, no utensils. No salt or pepper. Nothing,” Urmi said. Twitter user Raymond Truesdale documented the frustration between travelers at the Toronto hotel and staff. Truesdale said, “Here at Hotel Sheraton airport terminal 3 They were ill-prepared for this 3-day quarantine No kitchen staff no food they say no water people have come to lobby boondoggle.”  Here at Hotel Sheraton airport terminal 3 They were ill prepared for this 3 day quarantineNo kitchen staff no food they say no water people have come to lobby boondoggle pic.twitter.com/Zdcl37XuNY — Ray Truesdale (@RaySuperurass) February 26, 2021  Multiple confrontations broke out between those in quarantine and hotel staff about lack of food and water.  @Canada help at Sheraton airport boondoggle pic.twitter.com/NZ5N3KOSiG — Ray Truesdale (@RaySuperurass) February 26, 2021  This time there was “no food, no water.”  Wow unbelievable no food no water pic.twitter.com/3UZC7rhWLk — Ray Truesdale (@RaySuperurass) February 26, 2021      …and when they got food – the hotel price gouged the living hell out of those in quarantine. Judging by the content of the food, it was certainly not worth $50.  This what being served in one quarantine Hotel Sheraton gateway airport Toronto 50 dollars ordered at 4 pm got delivered at 10 pm pic.twitter.com/bw50W7yXzy — Ray Truesdale (@RaySuperurass) February 28, 2021  The mandatory quarantines have restricted these people from going outside to retrieve food. So they must rely on staff who were not adequately equipped with supplies. At a Holiday Inn quarantine in Toronto, residents also complained about water shortages, cold food, and a lack of utensils. “I was so hungry. I called so many times,” one woman told CTV News. Canadian officials were underprepared as the lack of security and confusion among hotel staff resulted in starving people.           A spokesperson for the Minister of Health said they had been informed of many of these mishaps. “We’re aware of reports that some travelers have experienced issues with food and accommodation at government-authorized hotels during their mandatory 3-night hotel stopover,” they said in an email. “The Public Health Agency of Canada is working directly with hotel partners to find solutions to these issues.” Police at Toronto Pearson International Airport slapped several people with fines after they attempted to escape quarantine. Other reports state there have been multiple sexual assaults at these quarantine hotels – calls for lawmakers to end the program are mounting. Canada’s sudden imposition of mandatory hotel quarantine for incoming air travelers has done nothing to suppress the virus’ spread but has only created more problems.  Source: Zero Hedge Become a Patron!

"Has Dogecoin, Elon Musk’s ‘People’s Crypto’, Fizzled Out After Record Rally?","Dogecoin value is faltering after a record making rally where it hit new highs. Dogecoin's value was driven up with enthusiastic backing from people like Elon Musk, who helped drive the value of the light-hearted dog-themed cryptocurrency that was created as a meme, to an all-time high. The value of the cryptocurrency soared to $0.45 (approximately Rs 34) on April 16.However, since then the cryptocurrency has been on a downslide. The crash began on April 21, a day after fans of Dogecoin celebrated ‘Doge Day'. Using hashtags such as DogeDay and DogeDay420, backers posted memes and messages on various social media platforms to fuel a rise in the cryptocurrency's value. On Friday, (at the time of writing), Dogecoin's price was just over Rs. 16.The rise of Dogecoin has been heavily influenced by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, whose tweets time and again have sent the price of the cryptocurrency soaring.Dogecoin Price Slumps After Hashtag-Fuelled Surge to Record HighOn April 15, Musk tweeted the photo of a 1926 painting ‘Dog Barking At The Moon' by a Spanish artist and changed the title of the artwork ‘Doge barking at the moon', referring to the cryptocurrency. That took the value of Dogecoin to all-time high. However, since it began crashing, Musk hasn't tweeted anything yet about the cryptocurrency.In February, a series of tweets by Musk, hailing Dogecoin, took the value of the meme-based cryptocurrency to wild levels. He first tweeted a photo of a rocket reaching the moon, and followed it up with a one-word tweet: “Doge”.pic.twitter.com/vviUzWhodT— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021Doge— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021Musk also posted his version of the iconic Lion King image of Rafiki holding a baby Simba over Pride Rock. He replaced the mandrill-shaman's face with his own while the lion cub's face was replaced with that the Dogecoin logo — the Japanese dog breed Shiba Inu.The business magnate did not stop at that. He put up two more posts on the cryptocurrency. “Dogecoin is the people's crypto,” he wrote and followed it up with a rather funny yet witty tweet: “No highs, no lows, only Doge”.Dogecoin Rides Elon Musk’s Tweet to Reach Rs. 10 Mark: All You Need to KnowDogecoin is the people's crypto— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021No highs, no lows, only Doge— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021Apart from Musk, rapper Snoop Dogg and Kiss singer Gene Simmons, too, have backed Dogecoin.In February, Snoop Dogg tweeted at Musk with a parody of one of his albums, with the ‘Snoop Doge'.Simmons tweeted in February told his followers that he had “bought a big position in Dogecoin”. In another tweet, he just wrote “To the moon”, with an image of Musk pushing the cryptocurrency higher.Dogecoin was the brainchild of techies Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who started it merely as a joke to sidestep traditional banking fees in 2013 when it was trading around $0.000232 (roughly Rs 0.017).",-0.8,-0.8,-0.8,0.5

Ripple CEO says more crypto firms may leave U.S. due to 'confusing' rules,"More crypto firms may leave the U.S. for more progressive jurisdictions like Europe if regulators continue to crack down on them, said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in an exclusive CNBC interview.The U.S. blockchain services firm acquired a Swiss crypto startup on Wednesday that will help the firm expand its operations overseas.""Europe really has provided leadership and countries like UAE ... the growth you're seeing ... even the U.K. and Singapore, they're providing the clarity about how they will regulate these digital assets,"" said Garlinghouse. ""Confusing"" regulations in the U.S. will push more crypto companies to leave the U.S. as firms like Ripple look to hire and invest outside the country, the CEO of blockchain services company Ripple told CNBC in an exclusive interview.""Europe really has provided leadership and countries like UAE ... the growth you're seeing ... even the U.K. and Singapore — they're providing the clarity about how they will regulate these digital assets,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Thursday.""And that allows through those rules of the road that allow entrepreneurs, investors to engage constructively with regulators,"" Garlinghouse said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""""Frankly, it's why you're seeing entrepreneurship and investment flowing into other jurisdictions — and certainly Europe has been a significant beneficiary of the confusion that has existed in the U.S.,"" he added.His comments come after the crypto firm announced Wednesday it had bought Metaco, a Swiss crypto custody services firm, at a time when U.S. regulators are cracking down harshly on companies like Ripple and crypto exchange Coinbase. The Metaco acquisition is expected to expand Ripple's suite of products and allow it to access an attractive clientele that includes Citi and BNP Paribas.""We think Metaco is a perfect fit, from where we're trying to grow our customers today,"" said Garlinghouse.Crypto firms have threatened to leave the U.S. in a bid to send a signal to regulators that the country may miss out on a key technological innovation.Ripple is fighting a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has accused Ripple, Garlinghouse and the firm's co-founder Chris Larsen, of breaching securities laws by selling XRP without first registering it with the SEC. XRP is the native cryptocurrency on the Ripple network. In April, Coinbase took legal action against the SEC after months of silence from the regulator regarding the crypto exchange's July 2022 petition on whether existing securities rule-making processes could be extended to the crypto industry.The U.S. has also accused Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, of violating compliance rules to solicit American customers.When asked about the bankruptcy of the crypto giant FTX, Garlinghouse said in the interview that ""what happened in FTX is called a fraud"" and ""is not specific to crypto.""""I think it's fair to say the U.S. has made it as confusing as possible as to what the rules of the road are for the crypto industry. As you described, the U.S. SEC has really been at the forefront of that confusion,"" said Garlinghouse. ""Unfortunately, that has encouraged companies like Ripple to invest more outside of the U.S.,"" said Garlinghouse, adding that 95% of Ripple's customers are non-U.S. and most of Ripple's hiring this year will be outside of the U.S.Garlinghouse said Ripple is in a good financial position. Ripple funded the Metaco purchase with $250 million of cash off its own balance sheet, according to him.""Ripple has a very strong balance sheet and we are leaning in and playing offense and this is just an example of that,"" said Garlinghouse.""Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy,"" he said, quoting investor billionaire Warren Buffett. On Ripple's listing plans, Garlinghouse said they are ""not in a hurry to list"" and ""not in need to raise more capital.""""So if we were to consider [to list], it would be at a time and place that made sense. We wouldn't want to do that unless we felt like it actually enhances the ability to grow the business, the customer experience,"" he added.",-0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8
Is President Biden Attacking Small Business on Purpose?,"Is the President pro-big business?While Biden claims to support small businesses, many of the policies like the PRO Act penalize small-business owners while larger corporations walk away relatively unscathed. Small businesses can be fragile, and more regulations and restrictions on top of the recent pandemic closures could result in fewer and fewer successful small businesses. According to a new study by the Federal Reserve, an additional 200,000 businesses closed in the past year due to the pandemic. Successful small business owners are often lumped into the same category as billion-dollar corporations who can better absorb the increased costs.Related: Do the Top 1% Really Cheat on Their Taxes?We need small businesses to succeed now more than ever to continue to regain a strong economy. To do so, the public needs to understand the perspective of these business owners, including the struggles they've faced in the last year and Biden's proposed policies that could devastate them. We'll continue to discuss these topics and more in my next article on pandemic policies that fundamentally discourage small businesses. ",-0.8,0.2,0.2,0.2
