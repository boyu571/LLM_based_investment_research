       "'\\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our\\xa0website policy\\xa0prior to making financial decisions.\\nAs forecasted yesterday, the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) turned lower than the estimated consensus of 8.7%. July saw an 8.5% CPI inflation rate, which is a welcome reprieve from June’s 9.1%. Both crypto and stock markets reacted favorably.\\nBitcoin regained its $1k loss, now trading at $24k. Likewise, Ethereum went up by +9.5%, at $1,847. Nasdaq and S&P 500 had a more muted response, going up by nearly +2%, suggesting that the market already priced in a favorable CPI forecast.\\nMarket’s reaction after July’s CPI report indicated inflation’s peak. Image credit: Trading View\\nWhy Did Inflation Go Down?\\nIn the first half of July, the Biden administration called June’s inflation data “out-of-date”. Although this could’ve been construed as downplaying unfavorable data, we pointed out that this is most likely correct. Outside the Fed flooding the economy with money to trigger inflation, the biggest inflation driver is an increase in energy costs.\\xa0\\nDespite the green narrative, in 2021, 90% of the transport industry relied on petroleum products, according to EIA. Correspondingly, nearly half of the inflation increase comes from that source, which was annually up by +41.6% in June. Since then, gas prices have been falling for nearly two months, as the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil went down.\\nWTI global oil benchmark returned to pre-Ukraine conflict level.\\xa0Image credit: Trading View\\nThe latest CPI report for July noted that the gasoline index dropped by -7.7%, in addition to the energy index dropping by -4.6%. However, considering that annualized all-energy cost is still up by 32.9%, that momentum will have to be sustained. Effectively, this means that the decrease in gasoline merely neutralized some of the food and shelter costs, as exemplified by still rising household expenditures.\\nBank of America’s Consumer Checkpoint report\\nLastly, the inflation rate went down due to the dollar becoming much stronger compared to the euro. Yesterday, we showed how deeply Europe self-sanctioned itself when it sanctioned Russia. Because the Dollar Strength Index (DXY) is weighted against the euro at 57.6%, this topped DXY at a 20-year high, simultaneously as the euro dropped to a 20-year low.\\nWithout the dollar enjoying its global reserve currency status, inflation would most likely already be in hyper-inflation territory.\\xa0As things stand now, the Fed should restrain from spooking the market with even larger rate hikes, which is why the market’s reaction was positive.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin our\\xa0Telegram group\\xa0and never miss a breaking digital asset story.\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Ahead for the Crypto Market?\\nAs risk-on assets, the Fed devastated the crypto market with each interest rate hike to curb inflation. The year began with a total crypto market cap at $2.18 trillion, having since melted by -48%, at $1.13 trillion as of today. Bitcoin makes 41.05% percent of that share, returning to January’s level of market dominance.\\nEthereum is the main culprit for Bitcoin’s reduction. Although the year-to-date BTC vs. ETH performance is minuscule, at -49% vs – 51% respectively, the same cannot be said for last month. During the last 30 days, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin by +40%, thanks to the hype surrounding its upcoming Merge upgrade in September.\\xa0\\nIf Ethereum performance keeps up, it could become #1 crypto by market cap. Image credit: Trading View\\nEthereum’s proof-of-work to proof-of-stake milestone could be a turning point for the crypto market, opening the floodgates to ESG investors concerned about energy footprints. Given the fact that Ethereum also has the largest and most reliable Web3 community, we could be looking at Ethereum/Bitcoin flippening.\\xa0\\nThis also depends on the new crypto legislation, by which Ethereum would fall under CFTC as a commodity. Presently, the SEC only views Bitcoin as a commodity.\\n\\n\\nFinance is changing.\\nLearn how, with Five Minute Finance.\\nA weekly newsletter that covers the big trends in FinTech and Decentralized Finance.\\nTry it out (for free)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAwesome\\nYou’ve subscribed.\\nYou’re well on your way to being in the know.\\n\\n\\nThe Surge is yet to scale up Ethereum after the Merge, late next year. Do you think Ethereum will still hold its dApp-host dominance? Let us know in the comments below.\\n'"
