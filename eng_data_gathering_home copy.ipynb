Tether has requested people who trade in bitcoins to not to purchase USDT tokens from the above address.\\nTether has temporarily suspended its backend wallet system.

It's an extra layer of protection for transactions and the hacker cannot move funds from its address to any other account which has Omni Core running on the backend. At present, Tether is making sure that all of its members have Omni Core in their systems.\\nThe Bitcoins Are Falling After the Hacker Attack\\nAccording to the\\xa0bitcoin up, the attackers has shaken the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, Ethereum and also Bitcoin cash has fallen considerably against the U.S. dollar.\\nAs soon as the news broke out, Tether has fallen 0.3 percent in value according to coinmarketcap.com.
